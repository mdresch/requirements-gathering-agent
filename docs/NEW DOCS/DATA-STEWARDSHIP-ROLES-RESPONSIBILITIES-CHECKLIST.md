# Checklist: Implementing the Data Stewardship and Roles & Responsibilities Framework

This checklist outlines the tasks required to add the **Data Stewardship and Roles & Responsibilities** document type to the ADPA Document Generator.

---

## 1. Create Template and Processor Files

- [x] Create the template file: `src/modules/documentTemplates/dmbok/DataStewardshipRolesTemplate.ts`
- [x] Implement the `DataStewardshipRolesTemplate` class with a `buildPrompt()` method that defines the document structure.
- [x] Create the processor file: `src/modules/documentTemplates/dmbok/DataStewardshipRolesProcessor.ts`
- [x] Implement the `DataStewardshipRolesProcessor` class, ensuring it uses the template and the `AIProcessor` to generate the document content.

## 2. Register the Processor

- [x] Open `src/modules/documentGenerator/processor-config.json`.
- [x] Add a new entry for `data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities`.
- [x] Define the `module` path pointing to the new processor class.
- [x] List dependencies, such as `data-governance-framework` and `data-architecture-modeling-guide`.
- [x] Assign a `priority` for generation order (suggested: 8).

## 3. Add a Generation Task

- [x] Open `src/modules/documentGenerator/generationTasks.ts`.
- [x] Add a new task object to the `GENERATION_TASKS` array for `data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities`.
- [x] Ensure the following fields are correctly filled out:
  - `key`: 'data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities'
  - `name`: 'Data Stewardship and Roles & Responsibilities'
  - `category`: 'dmbok'
  - `func`: 'generateDataStewardshipRoles'
  - `emoji`: 'ðŸ‘¥'
  - `priority`: 8
  - `pmbokRef`: 'DMBOK: Data Governance - Roles & Responsibilities'

## 4. Add File Manager Configuration

- [x] Open `src/modules/fileManager.ts`.
- [x] Add a new entry to the `DOCUMENT_CONFIG` object for `data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities`.
- [x] Specify the following properties:
  - `title`: 'Data Stewardship and Roles & Responsibilities'
  - `filename`: 'dmbok/data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities.md'
  - `category`: DOCUMENT_CATEGORIES.DMBOK
  - `description`: 'Framework defining data stewardship roles, responsibilities, and governance structure.'
  - `generatedAt`: ''

## 5. Test and Validate

- [x] Build the project: `npm run build`
- [x] Run the generator for the new document with verbose output: `node dist/cli.js generate data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities --verbose`
- [x] Verify the processor loads correctly without errors.
- [x] Confirm the new document is listed: `node dist/cli.js list-templates`
- [x] Inspect the generated file `generated-documents/dmbok/data-stewardship-roles-responsibilities.md` to ensure its content and formatting are correct.

## 6. Update Documentation

- [x] Update `README.md` to include the new **Data Stewardship and Roles & Responsibilities** document in the DMBOK section and usage examples.
- [x] Add a brief description of the document's purpose and when to use it.
