# Implementation Plan: Output Generated Documents Version Control System

## 1. Objectives
- Automatically track changes to generated documents (Markdown, PDF, etc.) in a dedicated version control system.
- Enable users to view history, diffs, and revert to previous versions of generated documents.
- Support both local (git-based) and optional remote (GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.) repositories.
- Integrate seamlessly with the document generation workflow.

## 2. Design Decisions
- Use Git as the underlying VCS for simplicity and wide tool support.
- Store generated documents in a dedicated folder (e.g., `generated-documents/`).
- Optionally, use a separate branch or subdirectory for generated content.
- Provide CLI commands for VCS actions (commit, log, diff, revert, etc.).
- Optionally, allow users to configure remote repository sync.

## 3. Implementation Steps

### a. Initialize VCS for Generated Documents
- On first run (or via CLI command), initialize a git repository in `generated-documents/` if not already present.
- Add a `.gitignore` to exclude non-document files (e.g., temp, logs).

### b. Automate Commit on Document Generation
- After each document generation run, automatically:
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "Generated/updated documents on <date/time> [by <provider/model>]"`
- Optionally, tag releases or major milestones.

### c. Provide CLI Commands for VCS Operations
- `rga-docs vcs log` — Show history of generated documents.
- `rga-docs vcs diff <file>` — Show changes for a specific document.
- `rga-docs vcs revert <file> <commit>` — Revert a document to a previous version.
- `rga-docs vcs status` — Show uncommitted changes in generated docs.
- `rga-docs vcs push/pull` — (Optional) Sync with remote repository.

### d. User Configuration
- Add VCS options to `config-rga.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "docsVcs": {
      "enabled": true,
      "remote": "git@github.com:yourorg/generated-docs.git",
      "autoCommit": true,
      "branch": "main"
    }
  }
  ```
- Allow users to enable/disable VCS, set remote, and configure auto-commit.

### e. Documentation & Guidance
- Update project docs to explain:
  - How document versioning works.
  - How to use CLI VCS commands.
  - How to connect to a remote repository (if desired).

### f. Testing & Validation
- Test with local-only and remote repository scenarios.
- Validate that all document changes are tracked and history is accessible.
- Ensure no secrets or sensitive files are committed.

## 4. Optional Enhancements
- Integrate with GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines for automated publishing.
- Provide a web UI for browsing document history and diffs.
- Support other VCS backends (e.g., Mercurial) if needed.

## 5. Milestones
1. Local git VCS for generated documents (auto-commit, log, diff, revert).
2. CLI commands for VCS operations.
3. Remote repository sync (optional).
4. Documentation and user guidance.
