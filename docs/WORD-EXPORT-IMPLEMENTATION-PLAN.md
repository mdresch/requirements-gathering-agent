## 🔍 Known Issues, Validation & Troubleshooting

### 🚨 Presentation Quality Issues (To Be Addressed)
- [ ] **Bold Text Rendering** — Markdown bold (`**text**`) not always rendered as Word bold
- [ ] **Table Formatting** — Markdown tables render as plain text, not native Word tables
- [ ] **Project Title Display** — Title formatting in document header needs review
- [ ] **Rich Editing Validation** — Test all advanced Word formatting features
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Testing** — Verify compatibility across Word versions
- [ ] **Professional Formatting QA** — Complete document presentation audit

### ⚠️ Missing or Incomplete Documents After Export

The following documents are currently missing or incomplete after DOCX export:

- Mission, Vision & Core Values (`generated-documents/strategic-statements/mission-vision-core-values.md`)
- Project Purpose (`generated-documents/strategic-statements/project-purpose.md`)
- AI Project Kickoff Checklist (`generated-documents/planning-artifacts/project-kickoff-checklist.md`)

**Troubleshooting:**
- Check CLI output for errors or skipped tasks.
- Ensure each document is registered in `GENERATION_TASKS` and has a valid processor method.
- Validate that the markdown/AI content is not empty or failing validation.
- Re-run the CLI with `--verbose` for more details.

### 📝 Validation Checklist
- [ ] Bold, italic, and combined formatting
- [ ] Code snippets and monospace font
- [ ] Strikethrough and underline
- [ ] Heading hierarchy and styles
- [ ] Table conversion and styling
- [ ] List formatting (bullets, numbers, nesting)
- [ ] Document metadata and title
- [ ] Page layout and font consistency
- [ ] Rich editing functions in Word

---

## 🧪 Testing & QA
- [x] Generate test documents for all types
- [x] Open in Microsoft Word and verify no corruption
- [ ] Manually validate formatting (bold, tables, headings, etc.)
- [ ] Automated tests for markdown-to-docx conversion (future)

---

## 📈 Status & Next Steps
- ✅ **Core DOCX export is complete and robust for all document types and CLI workflows**
- 🔄 **Next:** Focus on advanced formatting polish (bold, tables, title, rich editing)
- 🔄 **Future:** Add custom templates, branding, table of contents, and PDF export
