# Direct Adobe.io Development Guide (No Azure Required)

## Immediate Development Approach

Since you already have Adobe.io platform console access, we can start building the Adobe integration directly into your ADPA Office Add-in right now, without any Azure services or costs.

## Phase 1: Direct Adobe.io Integration

### Step 1: Adobe.io API Setup (Use Your Existing Console Access)

1. **Get Your Adobe Credentials** (from your existing console)
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret  
   - Organization ID
   - Scopes (PDF Services, Document Generation, etc.)

2. **Test API Access**
```bash
# Test your Adobe.io credentials
curl -X POST "https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&scope=openid,AdobeID,session,additional_info.projectedProductContext"
```

### Step 2: Direct Integration in Your ADPA Word Add-in

No Azure, no external services - just direct Adobe.io API calls from your Office Add-in.

## Implementation Options

### Option A: Client-Side Integration (Simplest)
- Adobe.io API calls directly from your Office Add-in
- Credentials managed in environment variables
- Perfect for development and proof-of-concept

### Option B: Local Node.js Service (More Secure)
- Simple local Express.js server
- Handles Adobe.io API calls
- Office Add-in calls your local service
- Better credential security

### Option C: Existing Server Integration
- Add Adobe.io capabilities to any existing server you have
- Could be a simple PHP, Python, or Node.js script
- Office Add-in makes requests to your server

## Let's Implement Option A First (Simplest)

This gets you started immediately with zero infrastructure costs.
