# ADPA Implementation Plan for Coding Agent

## Overview
This implementation plan is based on a review of the generated documentation for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project. The plan is designed to guide a coding agent (or team) in delivering the core features, integrations, and technical requirements described in the project documentation.

---

## 1. Project Vision & Goals
- Deliver a unified, AI-powered platform for generating, managing, and integrating business-critical documentation.
- Ensure compliance with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 standards.
- Provide robust integrations with Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, and VCS tools.
- Support multiple interfaces: CLI, REST API, and web admin portal.

---

## 2. Core Feature Implementation Steps

### 2.1 Standards-Compliant Document Generation
- [x] Implement document templates for all required standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
- [x] Build/extend the document generation engine to support CLI, API, and web triggers.
- [x] Ensure output formats include Markdown, PDF, and JSON.
- [x] Integrate acceptance criteria and user story validation.

### 2.2 Multi-Provider AI Orchestration
- [x] Integrate OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama as AI providers.
- [x] Implement provider failover and health checks.
- [x] Support context-aware prompt engineering and smart template selection.

### 2.3 Enterprise Integrations
- [ ] Implement Confluence integration (OAuth2, page publishing, metadata sync).
- [ ] Implement SharePoint integration (OAuth2, document library sync, metadata).
- [ ] Integrate Adobe Document Services for PDF generation and manipulation.
- [ ] Provide VCS integration for document versioning and audit trails.

### 2.4 Security & Compliance
- [ ] Enforce RBAC, OAuth2, SAML, and API key authentication.
- [ ] Implement audit logging and compliance reporting.
- [ ] Ensure all generated documents are standards-compliant and traceable.

### 2.5 API & Web Portal
- [ ] Build REST API endpoints for all document and integration workflows.
- [ ] Develop the Next.js/React admin portal for project and document management.
- [ ] Implement user management, project dashboards, and workflow triggers.

---

## 3. Technical Architecture & Stack
- Node.js (≥18.x), TypeScript (≥5.7), Express.js (API), Next.js/React (admin portal)
- Tailwind CSS, Axios, Docker, Kubernetes (for scalable deployment)
- Multi-provider AI SDKs, OAuth2 libraries, OpenAPI 3.0 for API docs

---

## 4. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] Set up monorepo structure and CI/CD pipeline
- [x] Implement core document generation engine and basic templates
- [x] Integrate at least one AI provider (OpenAI or Google AI)
- [x] Build initial CLI and REST API endpoints

### Phase 2: Integrations & Security
- [ ] Add Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe integrations
- [ ] Implement authentication, RBAC, and compliance features
- [ ] Expand template library and standards coverage

### Phase 3: Advanced Features & Scaling
- [ ] Add provider failover, advanced context management, and smart template selection
- [ ] Build admin web portal and dashboards
- [ ] Optimize for scalability, monitoring, and enterprise deployment

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- All features must pass user story acceptance criteria as defined in `user-stories.md`.
- All integrations must be tested in enterprise-like environments.
- Documentation, security, and compliance must be validated by stakeholders.

---

## 6. Next Steps for Coding Agent
- [ ] Review and prioritize user stories and requirements.
- [ ] Set up the development environment as per the technical stack.
- [ ] Begin implementation with Phase 1 tasks, tracking progress in project management tools.
- [ ] Regularly sync with stakeholders for feedback and validation.

---

*This plan should be updated as features are delivered and requirements evolve. For detailed requirements, see the generated documentation in each subdirectory.*

---

## 7. Ongoing Best Practices & Recommendations

- **Iterative Delivery:** Break down large features into small, testable increments. Use feature branches and pull requests for all changes.
- **Documentation:** Update technical and user documentation as features are delivered. Maintain clear API docs and integration guides.
- **Testing:** Ensure all new code is covered by unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Use CI/CD to enforce test coverage and code quality.
- **Security:** Regularly review authentication, authorization, and data handling. Rotate secrets and audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance:** Validate all outputs and integrations against BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK standards. Document compliance checks and traceability.
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Schedule regular demos and feedback sessions with stakeholders. Adjust priorities based on feedback and evolving requirements.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Review and refine processes, tools, and architecture. Encourage team learning and adoption of new best practices.
