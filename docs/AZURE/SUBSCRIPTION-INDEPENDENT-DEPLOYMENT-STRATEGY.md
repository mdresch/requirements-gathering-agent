# Subscription-Independent Deployment Strategy
## Standards Compliance & Deviation Analysis API

### Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to continue development, demonstration, and business value delivery for the Standards Compliance & Deviation Analysis API while awaiting Azure subscription activation (`e759446b-8bb7-4065-a0ed-9d5273a05c46`).

### Current Status
- **Target Subscription**: `e759446b-8bb7-4065-a0ed-9d5273a05c46` (pending activation)
- **Current CLI Subscription**: `3bb6fd82-796d-4ad5-87f0-4d9d47d09ae6` (active)
- **Impact**: Cannot deploy to intended Azure API Center resource group `rg-api-center`

   - Documentation completeness review

2. **Demo-Ready Environment**
   - Set up professional local demo environment
   - Create executive presentation materials
   - Prepare PMI board engagement materials
   - Document ROI calculations and business metrics

#### Phase 2: Alternative Cloud Strategy (1-3 days)
1. **Current Subscription Deployment**
   - Deploy to `3bb6fd82-796d-4ad5-87f0-4d9d47d09ae6` as proof-of-concept
   - Use alternative resource naming convention
   - Create migration documentation for target subscription

2. **Multi-Cloud Readiness**
   - Prepare containerized deployment options

$resourceGroup = "rg-api-center-demo"
$serviceName = "svc-api-center-demo"
$region = "westeurope"
```

#### Option B: Local Professional Setup
```bash
# Enhanced local environment with professional tooling
npm run dev
# + API Gateway simulation
# + Performance monitoring
# + Security scanning
# + Documentation hosting
```

#### Option C: Containerized Deployment
```dockerfile
# Cloud-ready containerization
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
