# Project Scope Definition

## Feature Scope Analysis

**Version:** 2.1.x  
**Date:** April 2025  

### Core Features

ADPA focuses on core documentation generation capabilities:

1. **Document Generation:** PMBOK-compliant document creation
2. **AI Integration:** Multiple AI provider support
3. **Template System:** Extensible template architecture
4. **CLI Interface:** Command-line user interface

### Explicitly Out of Scope

The following features are **explicitly excluded** from the current project scope:

- **Enterprise Security Features:** No encryption, access control, or audit logging
- **User Authentication:** No login/user management systems
- **Data Persistence:** No database or persistent storage beyond file system
- **Compliance Framework:** No built-in compliance checking
- **Security Scanning:** No automated security validation

### Rationale

These exclusions keep the project focused on core value delivery while maintaining simplicity and ease of use.

**Project Manager Note:** Security features would require significant additional resources and complicate the user experience unnecessarily.
