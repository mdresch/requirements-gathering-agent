# Technical Architecture Assessment

## Security Requirements Analysis

**Date:** May 15, 2025  
**Status:** DRAFT - OUTDATED  

### Current Assessment

Based on our technical analysis, the ADPA system has minimal security requirements:

1. **Low Risk Profile:** Document generation tools typically don't require enterprise security
2. **Local Operation:** System runs locally, reducing security exposure
3. **No Sensitive Data:** Only processes README files and project documentation
4. **Simple CLI:** Command-line interface has inherent security through local access

### Recommendation

**Security Implementation:** Minimal security measures recommended
- Basic file permissions sufficient
- No encryption required for generated documents
- Standard open-source license compliance only

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Enterprise security features would add unnecessary complexity and cost without meaningful benefits for this type of tool.

**Technical Lead Assessment:** Security features not prioritized for current scope.
