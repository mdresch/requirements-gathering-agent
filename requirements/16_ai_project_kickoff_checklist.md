# Project Kickoff & Requirements Gathering Checklist

## I. Stakeholder Engagement & Alignment
- [ ] Identify and document all key stakeholders (Project Manager, Developer/Technical Lead, Compliance Officer, Integrator/DevOps Engineer).
- [ ] Schedule and conduct initial stakeholder interviews or workshops to clarify needs and expectations.
- [ ] Confirm and document the project vision, business goals, and core values with stakeholders.
- [ ] Establish a communication plan (e.g., meeting cadence, preferred channels, escalation paths).
- [ ] Define roles and responsibilities for each user role.

## II. Requirements Elicitation & Validation
- [ ] Review and validate AI-generated user stories and acceptance criteria with stakeholders.
- [ ] Gather and document additional requirements or edge cases (especially around compliance, integration, and customization).
- [ ] Clarify and document customization needs for generated documentation (e.g., templates, project-specific details).
- [ ] Identify and document integration needs (API, CLI, CI/CD, other tools).
- [ ] Confirm regulatory, compliance, and quality requirements relevant to documentation outputs.

## III. Scope Definition & Prioritization
- [ ] Define and agree on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) feature set.
- [ ] Clearly document what is in-scope and out-of-scope for the initial release.
- [ ] Prioritize features and requirements (e.g., using MoSCoW or similar method).
- [ ] Identify and document potential future enhancements for backlog.

## IV. Technical & Architecture Planning
- [ ] Review and confirm the proposed technology stack (Node.js, TypeScript, Azure AI, OpenAI, etc.).
- [ ] Assess team skills versus the tech stack; identify training or hiring needs.
- [ ] Review and refine AI integration approach (API endpoints, authentication, error handling, fallback strategies).
- [ ] Define structured output formats (e.g., JSON schemas) for documentation artifacts.
- [ ] Plan for modularity and integration patterns (API, CLI, CI/CD).
- [ ] Identify and document configuration and environment variable management (dotenv, secrets).
- [ ] Plan for logging, monitoring, and error reporting.

## V. Risk, Security & Compliance Review
- [ ] Review and expand on the AI-generated risk analysis; brainstorm additional risks.
- [ ] Define and document risk mitigation strategies (e.g., for external API reliance, data privacy, AI output quality).
- [ ] Confirm handling of sensitive data and compliance with data privacy standards (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
- [ ] Plan for secure credential management and .env practices.
- [ ] Review and document compliance requirements for generated documentation (PMBOK, regulatory, quality).
- [ ] Plan for periodic review and update of templates/prompts as standards evolve.

## VI. Development & Quality Preparation
- [ ] Set up code repository, branching strategy, and access controls.
- [ ] Integrate automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest), linting (ESLint), and formatting (Prettier).
- [ ] Define coding standards and development best practices.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines (including automated documentation generation).
- [ ] Prepare initial development, testing, and staging environments.
- [ ] Develop and document initial sample inputs, templates, and output examples.

## VII. Documentation & Onboarding
- [ ] Draft and review user documentation (API, CLI usage, integration guides).
- [ ] Prepare onboarding materials for each user role (PM, Developer, Compliance Officer, Integrator).
- [ ] Document sample workflows for common use cases (e.g., generating a project charter, integrating with CI/CD).
- [ ] Establish a feedback loop for documentation and onboarding improvements.

## VIII. Success Criteria & Next Steps
- [ ] Define measurable success metrics/KPIs for the MVP and project phases.
- [ ] Outline a high-level project roadmap and timeline with milestones.
- [ ] Assign owners for all key action items and next steps.
- [ ] Schedule regular project status reviews and retrospectives.
