# AI-Generated Acceptance Criteria

### User Stories for Project Manager

**1. Generate comprehensive project management plans automatically**

- Given that the user has provided project details and objectives, When the Project Management Plan generation is initiated, Then the system produces a detailed plan that covers scope, timelines, milestones, and resource allocations.
- Given that the project management plan has been generated, When reviewed, Then it includes all key sections such as objectives, deliverables, and stakeholder roles.
- Given that the plan is generated, When the user exports or downloads it, Then the document is available in a standard format (e.g., PDF or Word) with consistent formatting and structure.

**2. Customize the scope and objectives of generated documents**

- Given that the user is on the customization interface, When they modify scope and objectives fields, Then the generated project plan reflects these changes accurately.
- Given that the user has input specific project goals, When the system generates the plan, Then the scope and objectives sections include the user-specified details.
- Given that the user saves customization settings, When a new project plan is generated, Then it incorporates the saved customizations by default.

**3. Review AI-generated project artifacts within a user-friendly interface**

- Given that the user accesses the review interface, When they open a generated document, Then it displays clearly labeled sections with options for editing or approving.
- Given that the user reviews a document, When they identify issues or inaccuracies, Then they can provide feedback or request revisions directly within the interface.
- Given that the user approves a document, When they confirm, Then the system records the approval status and allows for version control or download.

### User Stories for Software Developer / Technical Team Member

**1. Generate technical analysis reports automatically**

- Given that the developer has provided project technical inputs, When the report generation is triggered, Then the system produces a comprehensive technical analysis report including architecture, dependencies, and technical risks.
- Given that the report is generated, When viewed, Then it includes sections on system requirements, technical constraints, and potential bottlenecks.
- Given that the report is generated, When exported, Then the document is available in common formats (e.g., PDF, Word) with accurate formatting.

**2. Integrate documentation generation into existing workflow via CLI**

- Given that the developer has installed the CLI tool, When they run the documentation generation command within their development environment, Then the tool executes successfully and generates the appropriate documentation.
- Given that the CLI is used to generate documentation, When the command is executed with specific project parameters, Then the output matches the provided inputs and follows the predefined templates.
- Given that the CLI is integrated into the workflow, When a project build is completed, Then the documentation is automatically updated or generated as part of the build process.

**3. Access detailed project artifacts including requirements and risk assessments**

- Given that the user requests project artifacts, When they select the relevant section, Then the system displays detailed technical requirements, constraints, and risk assessments.
- Given that the artifacts are generated, When reviewed, Then they include comprehensive technical details that help in understanding project scope and potential issues.
- Given that the user downloads the artifacts, When they open the files, Then all relevant technical information is correctly formatted and complete.
