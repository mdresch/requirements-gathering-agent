### *As a Project Manager, I want to customize the generated documents with project-specific details so that the outputs are relevant and actionable for my team.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a generated document, When I input project-specific details (e.g., project name, objectives, stakeholders), Then those details are correctly reflected in all relevant sections of the document.
2. Given a template with placeholders, When I provide custom values, Then the final document replaces all placeholders with the provided values.
3. Given a need to update project information, When I edit the project details and regenerate the document, Then the updated information appears in the new version.

### *As a Project Manager, I want to quickly produce essential artifacts like project charters and stakeholder registers so that I can accelerate project initiation and planning.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a new project, When I select “Generate Project Charter”, Then a completed project charter is produced in under 2 minutes.
2. Given a list of stakeholders, When I input their information, Then a stakeholder register is generated with all required fields populated.
3. The system provides a one-click option to generate each essential artifact individually.

## 2. Developer/Technical Lead

### *As a Developer, I want to integrate the Requirements Gathering Agent into my Node.js/TypeScript workflow via an API so that documentation generation fits seamlessly into our development pipeline.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given an existing Node.js/TypeScript project, When I install and configure the Requirements Gathering Agent, Then I can access its features via a documented API.
2. Given a valid API call from my workflow, When I request documentation generation, Then the output is returned programmatically without manual intervention.
3. The API supports authentication and error handling as per the provided documentation.

### *As a Technical Lead, I want to receive AI-driven recommendations for technology stacks and architecture so that I can make informed decisions during project planning.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a set of project requirements, When I submit them to the system, Then I receive at least two AI-generated recommendations for technology stacks.
2. Given the selected technology stack, When I request architectural guidance, Then the system provides a high-level architecture diagram or description based on best practices.
3. Recommendations include rationale and references to industry standards or previous similar projects.

---

### *As a Developer, I want to access structured (JSON) documentation outputs so that I can easily use them in other tools or automate further processes.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a documentation generation request, When I specify JSON as the output format, Then the system returns a valid JSON object conforming to the documented schema.
2. The JSON output includes all required fields for downstream automation (e.g., project name, stakeholders, risks).
3. The system validates the JSON output and returns an error if the structure is invalid.

## 3. Compliance Officer

### *As a Compliance Officer, I want the generated documentation to include risk and quality management plans so that regulatory requirements are addressed from the start.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a documentation generation request, When the process completes, Then the output includes distinct sections for risk management and quality management plans.
2. Each plan section contains at least the minimum required elements as per PMBOK (e.g., risk identification, mitigation strategies, quality metrics).
3. The system prevents finalization of documentation if either plan section is missing or incomplete.

---

### *As a Compliance Officer, I want to review standardized, PMBOK-aligned documents so that I can efficiently verify compliance across multiple projects.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given generated documents, When I review them, Then each follows the PMBOK structure and uses standardized terminology.
2. The system provides a checklist or summary page highlighting PMBOK compliance for each document.
3. Given multiple projects, When I compare their documentation, Then the format and required sections are consistent across all projects.

---

### *As a Compliance Officer, I want to receive notifications when compliance considerations are missing or incomplete so that I can take corrective action early.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a generated document, When a required compliance section is missing or incomplete, Then I receive a notification (email, in-app, or dashboard alert) detailing the issue.
2. The notification includes specific information about which compliance criteria are unmet and suggested next steps.
3. The system logs all compliance-related notifications for audit purposes.

## 4. Integrator/DevOps Engineer

### *As an Integrator, I want to use the CLI to trigger documentation generation as part of our CI/CD pipeline so that documentation stays up-to-date automatically.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given access to the CLI, When I run the documentation generation command, Then the process completes successfully without manual intervention.
2. The CLI command can be integrated into popular CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) and runs without errors in a pipeline context.
3. The CLI returns a clear success/failure status code for pipeline automation.

---

### *As a DevOps Engineer, I want the module to be modular and easy to integrate with existing Node.js/TypeScript projects so that adoption and maintenance are straightforward.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Given a Node.js/TypeScript project, When I install the module, Then it does not conflict with existing dependencies.
2. The module can be imported and used in a single line of code as per the documentation.
