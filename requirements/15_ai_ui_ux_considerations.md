# AI-Generated UI/UX Considerations

Certainly! Here’s a structured set of high-level UI/UX considerations tailored to your Requirements Gathering Agent project, addressing all the requested areas:

---

## 1. Key UI Screens/Views/Components

While much of the tool is API/CLI-driven, a minimal web-based or desktop GUI (for configuration, review, and monitoring) would greatly enhance usability for non-technical users and support advanced features. Key screens/components might include:

### a. **Dashboard / Home**
- Overview of recent documentation generations, status, and quick actions.
- Notifications (e.g., compliance alerts, errors).

### b. **Project Setup / Configuration Wizard**
- Guided workflow for entering project-specific details (name, stakeholders, objectives, constraints, etc.).
- Option to import data from templates or previous projects.

### c. **Document Customization & Review**
- Interactive view of generated documents with sections for project charter, stakeholder register, risk/compliance plans, etc.
- Inline editing for customization of generated content.
- Side-by-side comparison for revisions or updates.

### d. **AI Recommendations Panel**
- Display AI-driven suggestions for technology stacks, architecture, and risk/compliance considerations.
- Allow users to accept, modify, or reject recommendations.

### e. **Export & Integration Controls**
- Download/export options for structured outputs (JSON, PDF, DOCX).
- API key management and webhook configuration for integration.
- CLI usage instructions and logs.

### f. **Compliance & Quality Checklist**
- Visual indicators for completeness of compliance/quality sections.
- Alerts or notifications for missing/incomplete items.

### g. **Settings & User Preferences**
- Module/integration settings (API endpoints, output formats, notification preferences).
- Personalization (e.g., default templates, language).

## 2. General UI/UX Principles

### **a. Clarity & Simplicity**
- Prioritize clear, jargon-free language and logical grouping of information.
- Use progressive disclosure: show advanced options only when needed.

### **b. Efficiency & Automation**
- Minimize manual steps; leverage sensible defaults, templates, and auto-fill wherever possible.
- Support batch operations for multi-project environments.

### **c. Accessibility & Inclusivity**
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-accessible.
- Use high-contrast color schemes, readable fonts, and provide alt text for icons.
- Comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### **Compliance Officer (Lisa)**
- **Compliance Dashboard:** At-a-glance view of compliance/risk/quality sections across projects.
- **Review Tools:** Highlight missing or incomplete compliance items; ability to add comments or request updates.
- **Notifications:** Configurable alerts for compliance issues.

### **Integrator/DevOps Engineer (Tom)**
- **Integration Settings:** Simple configuration of API endpoints, CLI commands, and webhook triggers.

## 4. Non-Functional UI/UX Aspects

### **Responsiveness**
- UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- Fast load times and low-latency interactions, even with large documents.

### **Intuitiveness**
- Self-explanatory navigation, tooltips, and contextual help.
- Consistent placement of controls and actions across screens.

### **Consistency**
- Uniform visual language, iconography, and terminology.
- Standardized layouts for document review, editing, and export.

### **Performance**
- Efficient handling of large or complex documentation sets.
- Real-time feedback for long-running operations (e.g., AI-driven generation).

### **Accessibility**
- Keyboard navigation throughout.
- Support for screen readers and assistive technologies.
- Colorblind-friendly palettes and scalable fonts.
