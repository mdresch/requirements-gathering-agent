# AI-Generated Project Summary and Business Goals

## Project Summary

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is a Node.js/TypeScript module designed to automate the generation of comprehensive project management documentation for software projects. Leveraging Azure AI, it produces PMBOK-aligned documents covering strategic planning, requirements, and detailed management plans. The tool supports both programmatic API usage and command-line operation, enforcing structured (JSON) output for easy integration. It is modular, works with any Node.js/TypeScript project, and aims to streamline and standardize the project documentation process, from initial vision and requirements through to detailed planning artifacts and compliance considerations.
