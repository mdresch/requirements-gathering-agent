## Notes

- **Extensibility:** The model supports future expansion (e.g., audit logs, versioning, feedback).
- **Normalization:** ArtifactType helps standardize document types and templates.
- **Compliance Tracking:** ComplianceRequirement and Notification support regulatory workflows.
- **Integration:** IntegrationConfig and AIRecommendation enable seamless workflow automation and intelligence.
