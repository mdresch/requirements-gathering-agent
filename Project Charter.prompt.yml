      # Cost Management Plan  

      ## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  


      ---


      ## 1. **Introduction and Purpose**  


      The Cost Management Plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent project
      defines the framework for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and
      controlling project costs to ensure the project is completed within the
      approved budget. This plan aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition standards and
      supports the project's objectives to deliver an AI-powered PMBOK
      documentation generator.  


      The purpose of this plan is to:  

      - Outline the processes and controls for managing project costs.  

      - Provide guidance for cost estimation, tracking, and reporting.  

      - Ensure cost-related decisions are made transparently and consistently.  

      - Enable proactive identification and resolution of cost variances.  


      ---


      ## 2. **Units of Measure**  


      Costs will be tracked and reported using the following units of measure:  

      - **Currency**: United States Dollars (USD) for all financial
      transactions.  

      - **Effort**: Staff hours for labor costs.  

      - **Deliverables**: Number of completed PMBOK-compliant documents or
      features.  

      - **Infrastructure Usage**: Resource consumption metrics for Azure OpenAI
      APIs (e.g., token usage).  


      ---


      ## 3. **Level of Precision and Accuracy**  


      - **Precision**: Cost estimates will be rounded to the nearest whole
      dollar for financial reporting and to the nearest hour for effort
      reporting.  

      - **Accuracy**: Cost estimates will have a tolerance of ±10% for initial
      planning phases and ±5% for execution and monitoring phases.  


      ---


      ## 4. **Organizational Procedures Links**  


      Cost management will adhere to organizational procedures and policies,
      including:  

      - **Procurement Guidelines**: Vendor and contract management procedures.  

      - **Financial Reporting Standards**: Monthly budget reporting templates
      and frequency.  

      - **Resource Allocation Policies**: Guidelines for staff-hour allocation
      and approval.  

      - **Compliance Standards**: Adherence to PMBOK and industry best practices
      for financial governance.  


      ---


      ## 5. **Control Thresholds**  


      Cost control thresholds are established to monitor variances against the
      approved budget:  

      - **Minor Variance**: Variance within ±5% of the planned budget requires
      monitoring but no corrective action.  

      - **Major Variance**: Variance exceeding ±10% requires immediate
      corrective measures and escalation to the project sponsor.  


      ---


      ## 6. **Rules of Performance Measurement**  


      Earned Value Management (EVM) will be used to track project performance
      and progress:  

      - **Planned Value (PV)**: Budgeted cost of work scheduled.  

      - **Earned Value (EV)**: Budgeted cost of work performed.  

      - **Actual Cost (AC)**: Actual cost incurred for work performed.  

      - **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: EV ÷ AC, indicating cost efficiency.  

      - **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: EV ÷ PV, indicating schedule
      efficiency.  


      ---


      ## 7. **Reporting Formats**  


      Cost reporting will follow a structured format to ensure clarity and
      consistency:  

      - **Weekly Cost Summary**:  
        - Breakdown of actual costs (labor, infrastructure, tools).  
        - Comparison with planned budget.  
        - Identification of variances and corrective actions.  

      - **Monthly Financial Report**:  
        - Total expenditures to date.  
        - Forecasted costs for remaining work.  
        - Risks and opportunities impacting budget performance.  

      Reports will be shared in PDF format via email and stored in the project
      documentation repository.

      ## 8. **Process Descriptions**  


      ### 8.1 **Cost Estimation**  

      Cost estimation will involve:  

      - **Bottom-Up Estimation**: Estimating costs by aggregating individual
      components (e.g., staff hours, infrastructure costs).  

      - **Historical Data Analysis**: Reviewing costs from similar projects to
      refine estimates.  

      - **Expert Judgment**: Consulting subject matter experts to validate
      assumptions.  

      - **Vendor Quotes**: Obtaining pricing from Azure OpenAI and other
      providers for infrastructure costs.  


      ### 8.2 **Cost Budgeting**  

      The total project budget will be developed by aggregating cost estimates
      and including contingency reserves for risks.  


      ### 8.3 **Cost Tracking and Control**  

      Costs will be tracked using:  

      - **Project Management Software**: Tools like Jira for effort tracking and
      Azure billing dashboards for infrastructure costs.  

      - **Variance Analysis**: Regular comparison of actual costs against
      planned budget.  

      - **Corrective Actions**: Adjustments to resource allocation or scope
      based on cost performance.  


      ---


      ## 9. **Funding Requirements**  


      Funding will be allocated as follows:  

      - **Initial Budget**: $50,000 for development and implementation phases.  

      - **Contingency Reserve**: 10% of the total budget for unforeseen
      expenses.  

      - **Payment Schedule**:  
        - 50% upfront for infrastructure and tool setup.  
        - 30% after milestone completion (e.g., CLI development).  
        - 20% upon project delivery and acceptance.  

      ---


      ## 10. **Cost Change Control Process**  


      Any changes to the project budget must follow the formal change control
      process:  

      1. **Change Request Submission**: Request submitted to the Change Control
      Board (CCB) with detailed justification and impact analysis.  

      2. **Review and Approval**: CCB reviews the request, evaluates its impact
      on the scope, schedule, and costs, and approves or rejects the change.  

      3. **Budget Update**: Update the budget and cost baselines after
      approval.  

      4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of the approved changes,
      including revised financial reports.  


      ---


      ## 11. **Cost Estimation Methods and Approach**  


      The project will use the following cost estimation methods:  

      - **Parametric Estimation**: Using cost-per-unit metrics (e.g., $0.02 per
      token for Azure OpenAI usage).  

      - **Analogous Estimation**: Comparing costs with historical data from
      similar projects.  

      - **Three-Point Estimation**: Using optimistic, pessimistic, and most
      likely cost scenarios to improve accuracy.  

      - **Reserve Analysis**: Identifying contingency reserves for risks such as
      increased API usage or tool upgrades.  


      ---


      ## 12. **Cost Tracking Approach**  


      Cost tracking will be performed continuously to ensure alignment with the
      budget:  

      1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use Azure billing dashboards to track API
      usage costs.  

      2. **Effort Tracking**: Record staff hours in Jira and compare them
      against estimates.  

      3. **Variance Analysis**: Calculate cost and schedule variances using
      EVM.  

      4. **Monthly Reviews**: Conduct monthly budget reviews with project
      stakeholders.  

      5. **Risk Adjustments**: Update cost forecasts based on identified risks
      and opportunities.

      ## 13. **Tools and Resources for Cost Management**  


      - **Jira**: Effort tracking and resource allocation.  

      - **Azure OpenAI Billing Dashboard**: Infrastructure cost monitoring.  

      - **Google Sheets**: Budget summaries and variance analysis.  

      - **PMBOK Templates**: Cost management templates for consistent
      reporting.
