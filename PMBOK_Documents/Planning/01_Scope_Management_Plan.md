# AI-Generated Scope Management Plan

## Scope Management Plan

### 1. Introduction

The purpose of this Scope Management Plan is to define and document the processes, procedures, and responsibilities for managing scope on the Requirements Gathering Agent project. This plan ensures that all project work and deliverables are clearly defined, controlled, and formally accepted, while providing a structured approach to managing changes to project scope. The plan will be reviewed and tailored by the Project Manager and stakeholders as needed.

### 2. Process for Preparing a Detailed Project Scope Statement

**Objective:**  
To develop a comprehensive and approved project scope statement that clearly defines the boundaries, deliverables, constraints, and acceptance criteria for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.

**Inputs:**
- Project Charter
- High-level requirements (from charter and business goals)
- Stakeholder inputs (interviews, workshops)
- Organizational standards and PMBOK guidelines

**Process:**
1. **Requirements Elicitation:**  
   - The Project Manager facilitates sessions with key stakeholders (Sponsor, Technical Lead, Compliance Officer, DevOps Engineer, End Users) to clarify and expand high-level requirements.
   - Collect feedback on in-scope and out-of-scope items, success criteria, and constraints.

2. **Drafting the Scope Statement:**  
   - The Project Manager consolidates inputs to draft the detailed project scope statement.
   - The draft includes: project objectives, deliverables, boundaries, assumptions, constraints, and acceptance criteria.
   - Reference to PMBOK compliance and organizational documentation standards is ensured.

3. **Review and Validation:**  
   - Circulate the draft scope statement to stakeholders for review.
   - Gather comments and revise as necessary.

4. **Approval:**  
   - Obtain formal approval/sign-off from the Project Sponsor and key stakeholders.
   - Baseline the scope statement as the foundation for all subsequent scope management.

**Responsible Parties:**  
- Project Manager (lead)
- Stakeholders (review, input, approval)

### 3. Process for Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

**Objective:**  
To decompose the approved project scope statement into manageable work packages for effective planning, assignment, and monitoring.

**Process:**
1. **Scope Analysis:**  
   - The Project Manager and Technical Lead review the approved scope statement and deliverables.

2. **WBS Development Workshop:**  
   - Facilitate a collaborative workshop with the project team and relevant stakeholders to break down deliverables into logical components, subcomponents, and work packages.

3. **WBS Documentation:**  
   - Document the WBS hierarchically (e.g., via diagram or indented list), ensuring traceability to the scope statement.
   - Assign unique identifiers to each work package.

4. **WBS Dictionary:**  
   - Develop a WBS dictionary with detailed descriptions for each work package, including acceptance criteria and responsible parties.

5. **Review and Validation:**  
   - Circulate the WBS and dictionary to stakeholders for feedback.
   - Revise as necessary for clarity and completeness.

**Responsible Parties:**  
- Project Manager (facilitation, documentation)
- Technical Lead (input)
- Project Team (input)
- Stakeholders (review)

### 4. Process for Maintaining and Approving the WBS

**Objective:**  
To ensure the WBS remains current, accurate, and reflective of approved scope throughout the project lifecycle.

**Process:**
1. **Version Control:**  
   - Maintain the WBS and dictionary in a controlled repository with versioning.
   - Document all changes, with rationale and impact assessment.

2. **Update Procedure:**  
   - When scope changes are approved, the Project Manager updates the WBS and dictionary accordingly.
   - Notify all stakeholders of updates and provide the revised documents.

3. **Approval:**  
   - All substantive changes to the WBS require review and approval by the Project Sponsor and/or Change Control Board (CCB), as defined in the project governance plan.

4. **Baseline Management:**  
   - The WBS is baselined upon initial approval and after any approved changes.

**Responsible Parties:**  
- Project Manager (maintenance, communication)
- Project Sponsor/CCB (approval)

### 5. Process for Obtaining Formal Acceptance of Deliverables

**Objective:**  
To verify that all project deliverables meet defined acceptance criteria and obtain documented stakeholder approval.

**Process:**
1. **Verification:**  
   - Upon completion of each deliverable or major work package, the Project Manager coordinates an internal review against acceptance criteria (as defined in the scope statement and WBS dictionary).

2. **Stakeholder Review:**  
   - Deliverables are presented to relevant stakeholders (e.g., Sponsor, Compliance Officer, Technical Lead) for inspection and feedback.

3. **Formal Acceptance:**  
   - Stakeholders provide formal sign-off (written/email approval) for each deliverable meeting requirements.
   - Any required corrections or enhancements are tracked and addressed before final acceptance.

4. **Documentation:**  
   - Acceptance records are maintained in the project repository.

**Responsible Parties:**  
- Project Manager (coordination, documentation)
- Stakeholders (review, acceptance)

### 6. Process for Controlling Scope Change Requests

**Objective:**  
To manage, evaluate, and implement changes to project scope in a controlled and transparent manner.

**Process:**
1. **Change Request Submission:**  
   - Any stakeholder may submit a scope change request using the standardized change request form/template.

2. **Logging and Initial Assessment:**  
   - The Project Manager logs the request, performs an initial assessment (impact, urgency, rationale), and assigns a tracking number.

3. **Impact Analysis:**  
   - The Project Manager, with input from the project team, analyzes the impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, and risk.
   - Document findings and recommendations.

4. **Change Control Board (CCB) Review:**  
   - The CCB (or designated approvers, e.g., Sponsor, Project Manager) reviews the change request and impact analysis.
   - Decision: approve, reject, or request additional information.

5. **Implementation:**  
   - If approved, update all relevant project documents (scope statement, WBS, schedule, etc.).
   - Communicate changes to all stakeholders.
   - Update the change log and version control records.

6. **Monitoring:**  
   - Track implementation and ensure changes are integrated into ongoing work.

**Responsible Parties:**  
- Project Manager (facilitation, documentation)
- CCB/Approvers (review, decision)
- Project Team (impact analysis, implementation)
