# Communications Management Plan  
**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent  
**Version:** Draft v0.1  
**Date:** [To Be Completed]

---

## 1. Introduction

This Communications Management Plan outlines the approach for managing and distributing project information for the Requirements Gathering Agent project. The plan defines how project communications will be planned, structured, managed, and disseminated to ensure that all stakeholders receive timely, relevant, and accurate information, supporting effective project execution and stakeholder engagement.

---

## 2. Communication Requirements Analysis

Communication requirements are determined by:

- **Stakeholder Roles & Influence:** Based on the project charter and stakeholder register, each stakeholderâ€™s role, decision-making authority, and information needs are identified.
- **Project Complexity:** The technical and compliance-driven nature of the project requires clear, regular updates to mitigate risks and align expectations.
- **Regulatory & Quality Needs:** Given the focus on PMBOK compliance and quality, communication must support transparency and documentation for audits.
- **Integration & Adoption:** Frequent feedback from pilot teams and users is essential to guide development and integration.
- **Risk Sensitivity:** Early identification and escalation of issues is critical due to technical dependencies and compliance risks.

Stakeholder communication needs will be validated during project kickoff and updated as roles or requirements evolve.
