# AI-Generated Requirements Management Plan

Certainly! Here is a **draft Requirements Management Plan** tailored for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, using the context and guidance you provided. This plan is intended as a foundational document for review and tailoring by the project manager and stakeholders.

# Requirements Management Plan  
_Requirements Gathering Agent Project_

---

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this Requirements Management Plan is to define the approach and processes for identifying, documenting, analyzing, tracking, and managing both project and product requirements throughout the lifecycle of the Requirements Gathering Agent. This plan ensures that requirements remain aligned with project objectives, stakeholder needs, and compliance standards, and that all changes are controlled and traceable. The plan leverages initial AI-generated requirements artifacts (User Stories, Personas, Acceptance Criteria) as a starting point, and will be refined through stakeholder engagement and formal review.

## 2. Requirements Activities

### **Elicitation**

- **Inputs:**  
  - AI-generated User Stories, Personas, and Acceptance Criteria.
  - Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Stakeholder Register.
  - Stakeholder interviews, workshops, and feedback.
- **Process:**  
  - The Project Manager (PM) facilitates sessions with key stakeholders (Sponsor, Technical Lead, Compliance Officer, DevOps, End Users) to review, clarify, and expand upon the AI-generated requirements.
  - Additional requirements or clarifications are captured via workshops, interviews, and surveys.
  - All requirements, including compliance, security, and integration needs, are considered.

### **Analysis**

- **Process:**  
  - Requirements are analyzed for completeness, feasibility, and alignment with project objectives and constraints.
  - Requirements are categorized (e.g., functional, non-functional, compliance).
  - Conflicts, overlaps, and ambiguities are identified and resolved through stakeholder dialogue.

### **Documentation**

- **Process:**  
  - All requirements are documented in a standardized format (e.g., User Stories with Acceptance Criteria, structured JSON, requirements register).
  - Requirements are assigned unique identifiers for traceability.
  - Documentation is maintained in a controlled repository (e.g., version-controlled project directory or requirements management tool).

### **Validation**

- **Process:**  
  - Requirements are reviewed and validated with stakeholders for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
  - Formal sign-off is obtained from key stakeholders (Sponsor, Compliance Officer, Technical Lead) before baselining.
  - Requirements are revisited at major milestones or after significant changes.

## 3. Configuration Management for Requirements

### **Change Initiation**

- Any stakeholder may submit a requirements change request using a standardized form or ticketing system.
- Change requests must include rationale, description, and expected impact.

### **Impact Analysis**

- The Project Manager, with support from relevant team members, assesses the impact of the proposed change on scope, schedule, cost, quality, and compliance.
- Findings are documented and communicated to the Change Control Board (CCB) or designated approvers.

### **Tracking and Reporting**

- All requirements and change requests are tracked in a centralized log, with version history and status (e.g., proposed, under review, approved, implemented, rejected).
- Changes to requirements are version-controlled, with clear documentation of updates and rationale.

### **Approval**

- The CCB (or designated approvers) reviews impact analysis and makes a decision (approve, reject, defer).
- Approved changes are incorporated into the requirements baseline, and all impacted documents/artifacts are updated.
- Stakeholders are notified of requirement changes and updated documentation is distributed.

## 4. Requirements Prioritization Process

- **Initial Prioritization:**  
  - Requirements are initially prioritized based on business value, regulatory/compliance impact, risk, technical feasibility, and stakeholder urgency.
- **Methods:**  
  - MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Wonâ€™t Have) analysis.
  - Weighted scoring (based on alignment with project objectives, risk reduction, user impact).
  - Stakeholder voting or ranking during workshops.
- **Review:**  
  - Prioritization is revisited at key milestones or when significant new requirements or changes are proposed.
  - The Project Manager facilitates prioritization sessions with key stakeholders.

---

## 5. Product Metrics for Requirements

- **Requirement Coverage:**  
  - % of requirements with defined acceptance criteria.
  - % of requirements traced to test cases and validated.
- **Fulfillment:**  
  - % of requirements successfully implemented and accepted (per formal stakeholder sign-off).
  - Number of requirements with outstanding issues or non-compliance.
- **Quality & Compliance:**  
  - % of generated documents passing compliance and quality checks.
  - User satisfaction scores related to documentation completeness and accuracy.
- **Change Metrics:**  
  - Number and frequency of requirements changes post-baseline.
  - Average time to review and approve/reject requirement changes.

---

## 6. Traceability Structure

- **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  
  - A RTM will be maintained to map each requirement to its corresponding:
    - Source (e.g., stakeholder, AI-generated artifact)
    - Design/Development artifact(s)
    - Test case(s)
    - Related compliance or quality criteria
    - Associated deliverable(s)
  - The RTM ensures that all requirements are addressed in design, implemented in development, and verified in testing.
- **Maintenance:**  
  - The RTM is updated as requirements evolve and is reviewed at major milestones.
  - All requirements and their traceability links are version-controlled.
- **Example RTM Columns:**  
    | Req ID | Requirement Description | Source | Priority | Design Ref | Implementation Ref | Test Case(s) | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
    |--------|------------------------|--------|----------|------------|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|--------|

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                        | Responsibilities Related to Requirements Management                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager             | Lead requirements activities, maintain documentation, facilitate reviews, manage changes, ensure traceability. |
| Project Sponsor             | Approve baselined requirements, major changes, and prioritization decisions.        |
| Technical Lead/Developer    | Provide input on technical feasibility, participate in analysis, implement requirements, update RTM. |
| Compliance Officer          | Review requirements for regulatory and quality alignment, validate compliance-related requirements. |
| DevOps Engineer             | Advise on integration, deployment, and workflow-related requirements.               |
| Stakeholders (general)      | Provide requirements input, review and validate requirements, submit change requests, participate in prioritization. |

**Note:**  
This Requirements Management Plan is a living document and should be reviewed and tailored by the Project Manager and stakeholders as the project progresses. All procedures are aligned with PMBOK best practices and organizational standards.
