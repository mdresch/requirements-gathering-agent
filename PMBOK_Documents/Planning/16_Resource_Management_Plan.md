# Resource Management Plan  
*Requirements Gathering Agent Project (Draft)*

---

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this Resource Management Plan is to define the approach for identifying, acquiring, managing, and releasing all resources required for the successful delivery of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. This includes human resources (project team and stakeholders), physical resources (equipment, cloud services), and material resources (documentation, licenses). The plan ensures resources are available when needed, utilized efficiently, and aligned with the project’s objectives, core values, and constraints.

---

## 2. Identification of Resources

**Resource identification** is based on project requirements, the WBS, and the technology stack analysis. The following resource types have been identified:

### a. Human Resources
- **Project Manager**
- **Developer/Technical Lead**
- **Compliance Officer**
- **Integrator/DevOps Engineer**
- **Project Sponsor**
- **Azure/OpenAI Service Providers (external support)**
- **End Users (for pilot/testing and feedback)**

### b. Physical Resources
- **Development Workstations** (for developers, PM, etc.)
- **Cloud Infrastructure & AI Services**
  - Azure AI endpoints and authentication
  - OpenAI API access (as fallback)
- **Development Tools**
  - Node.js, TypeScript, ts-node, dotenv, relevant SDKs

### c. Material Resources
- **Documentation templates and guides**
- **Licenses for software/tools**
- **Test datasets and sample project inputs**
- **CI/CD pipeline configurations**

**Resource needs** will be periodically reviewed and updated as the project progresses, especially at phase gates and major milestones.

---

## 3. Acquisition of Resources

### a. Human Resources
- **Internal Assignment:**  
  Core roles (Project Manager, Developer/Technical Lead, Compliance Officer, DevOps Engineer) will be assigned from within the organization based on availability and required competencies.
- **External Support:**  
  - Azure/OpenAI service provider support will be accessed as needed (e.g., for API issues or advanced configuration).
  - Contractors or consultants may be engaged for specialized compliance/security review, pending budget approval.

### b. Physical Resources
- **Development Tools:**  
  Team members will use existing organizational laptops/desktops with appropriate access to install Node.js, TypeScript, and related tools.
- **Cloud Services:**  
  Azure AI and OpenAI API access will be provisioned through the organization’s cloud account. Credentials will be managed securely via environment variables (dotenv) and Azure authentication.
- **Licenses:**  
  Ensure all required software licenses are procured and compliant with organizational policies.

### c. Material Resources
- **Templates and Documentation:**  
  Project management templates, onboarding materials, and test datasets will be prepared by the Project Manager and Developer, with input from Compliance and DevOps.

*Acquisition will follow organizational procurement and access management processes, with the Project Manager responsible for coordination and escalation of any issues.*
