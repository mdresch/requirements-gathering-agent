# Project Schedule Development Input Document

## 1. Summary of Key Scheduling Inputs

The project has the following foundational inputs available:
- **Activity List:** A detailed decomposition of work packages into individual activities with unique IDs and descriptions.
- **Attributes:** Activity dependencies and logical sequences inferred from the activity list.
- **Duration Estimates (Relative):** Preliminary effort estimates expressed in relative terms (e.g., S, M, L) or placeholders for actual durations.
- **Resource Estimates (Types):** Broad resource categories (e.g., developers, testers, UI designers, AI specialists) assigned at a high level.
- **Network Diagram:** A logical flow of activities and dependencies (illustrative Mermaid syntax provided below).
- **Milestones:** Key project achievements and decision points.
- **Scope:** The overall scope defines the boundaries and deliverables, informing activity sequencing and dependencies.

## 2. Proposed Phased Project Structure

Based on the WBS and key milestones, the project can be logically segmented into the following high-level phases:

**Phase 1: Initiation & Planning**
- Establish project management framework, scope, schedule, and resource allocation.

**Phase 2: Requirements Gathering & Analysis**
- Engage stakeholders, document, validate, and analyze requirements.

**Phase 3: System Design & Prototyping**
- Develop architecture, UI prototypes, and initial system design.

**Phase 4: AI & Backend Development**
- Deploy AI models, develop backend modules, and system integrations.

**Phase 5: System Development & Documentation**
- Implement document management features, templates, and automation tools.

**Phase 6: Testing & Validation**
- Conduct unit, integration, UAT, performance, and security testing.

**Phase 7: Deployment & Training**
- Deploy to Azure, prepare documentation, and train users.

**Phase 8: Post-Deployment & Support**
- Monitor, issue resolution, feedback collection, and system enhancements.

## 5. Next Steps for Project Manager

To formalize and finalize the project schedule baseline, the Project Manager should:

1. **Refine Duration Estimates:** Collaborate with team members and subject matter experts to convert relative estimates into actual durations using estimation techniques (e.g., three-point estimates, analogous estimates).
2. **Assign Resources:** Map specific resources (team members, tools, external vendors) to activities, considering availability and skills.
3. **Input Data into Scheduling Tool:** Use professional project scheduling software such as Microsoft Project, Primavera, or equivalent to input activities, dependencies, durations, and resources.
4. **Perform Critical Path Analysis:** Identify the sequence of activities that determine the project's minimum duration.
5. **Resource Leveling & Optimization:** Adjust activity start dates to prevent over-allocation and optimize resource utilization.
6. **Incorporate Buffers & Contingencies:** Add schedule buffers based on risk assessments.
7. **Review & Validate:** Conduct schedule reviews with stakeholders and project team to ensure realism and buy-in.
8. **Obtain Schedule Approval:** Secure formal approval of the schedule baseline from project sponsors or governance bodies.

This structured approach ensures a realistic, resource-aware, and stakeholder-aligned project schedule ready for baseline establishment and ongoing management.
