# PMBOK® Project Charter (AI-Generated Draft)

# Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Project Purpose/Justification
The "Requirements Gathering Agent" is a Node.js/TypeScript module designed to automate the creation of comprehensive project management documentation aligned with PMBOK standards. By leveraging Azure AI and OpenAI services, it produces strategic planning documents, project artifacts, and management plans tailored for software projects. This initiative aims to improve documentation consistency, reduce manual effort, and streamline workflows, enabling organizations to efficiently generate PMBOK-compliant artifacts and support scalable, enterprise-grade project management practices.

## 2. Measurable Project Objectives and Success Criteria
- **Objectives:**
  - Develop a modular, scalable Node.js/TypeScript tool capable of generating a full suite of project management documents (e.g., scope statements, risk assessments, communication plans) aligned with PMBOK standards.
  - Integrate Azure AI and OpenAI services to automate content creation and technical analysis.
  - Enable CLI-based interaction for ease of use within existing development workflows.
  - Incorporate customization features for templates and document styles to meet organizational standards.
  - Ensure secure handling of API keys and sensitive data.

- **Success Criteria:**
  - Delivery of a functional prototype within [insert target date].
  - At least 80% accuracy and relevance in AI-generated documents as validated by project stakeholders.
  - User satisfaction score of 4+ out of 5 in post-deployment surveys.
  - Successful integration into at least one pilot project environment.
  - Demonstrated reduction in documentation preparation time by at least 30%.

## 3. High-Level Requirements
- Compatibility with Node.js and TypeScript environments.
- Integration with Azure AI and OpenAI APIs for document generation.
- Secure management of API credentials (e.g., environment variables, secret stores).
- CLI interface for user interaction.
- Support for exporting documents in common formats (PDF, Word).
- Modular design allowing for future extension (additional artifact types, templates).
- Validation mechanisms for input data quality.
- Role-based access controls for secure deployment.

## 4. High-Level Project Description and Boundaries
**Description:**  
This project develops a backend CLI tool that automates the generation of project management documentation, including plans, analysis reports, and stakeholder communications, using AI models. It emphasizes adherence to PMBOK standards and seamless integration into existing workflows.

**Boundaries:**  
- **Included:**  
  - Core documentation artifacts (e.g., project scope, risk register, communication plan).  
  - AI integration via Azure and OpenAI services.  
  - CLI-based user interface.  
  - Basic customization and export features.

- **Excluded:**  
  - Web-based GUI or frontend interfaces.  
  - Direct integration with project management tools (e.g., MS Project, Jira).  
  - On-premises AI deployment beyond cloud API calls.  
  - Long-term AI model training or customization beyond initial prompts.

## 5. Overall Project Risk
**Summary:**  
The project faces technical risks related to AI integration complexity, model reliability, and scalability. Security risks include credential management and data privacy concerns. Management risks involve scope creep and tight timelines for testing and validation. External risks include API changes, pricing adjustments, and regulatory compliance.

**Key Risks Include:**
- Compatibility issues with multiple AI services.
- Inaccuracy or inconsistency in AI-generated content.
- Scalability constraints impacting performance.
- Security vulnerabilities related to credential handling.
- External API updates or policy changes affecting operations.
- Misalignment with PMBOK standards or stakeholder expectations.

**Mitigation Strategies:**  
- Early proof-of-concept testing and validation.
- Robust security practices (secrets management, access controls).
- Clear scope definition and phased delivery.
- Continuous monitoring of external AI service updates.
- Stakeholder engagement for iterative feedback and refinement.
