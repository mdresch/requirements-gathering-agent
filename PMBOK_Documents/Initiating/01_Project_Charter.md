# Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent

---

## 1. Project Purpose / Justification

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to empower software teams by automating the creation of comprehensive, standardized, and compliant project management documentation. By leveraging Azure AI and supporting both API and CLI usage, the tool accelerates project initiation, fosters collaboration, and ensures every software project starts with clarity, confidence, and a strong foundation for success. This automation reduces manual effort, minimizes human error, and helps organizations meet regulatory and quality standards.

---

## 2. Measurable Project Objectives and Success Criteria

**Objectives:**
- **Automate Documentation:** Achieve at least 80% reduction in manual effort for generating PMBOK-compliant project management documents.
- **Standardization:** Ensure 100% of generated documents adhere to PMBOK guidelines and organizational standards.
- **Accelerate Initiation:** Reduce project initiation and planning document preparation time from days to hours.
- **Integration:** Provide seamless API and CLI integration for Node.js/TypeScript projects, with at least 3 successful integrations in pilot teams.
- **Compliance:** Include risk, compliance, and quality management sections in 100% of generated outputs.

**Success Criteria:**
- User satisfaction scores of ≥4 out of 5 among pilot users (Project Managers, Developers, Compliance Officers, DevOps Engineers).
- Successful automated generation of project charters, stakeholder registers, and management plans in at least 90% of test cases.
- No critical compliance or regulatory gaps found in automated documentation during review.
- Documentation outputs are structured (JSON) and compatible with at least two external tools or workflows.

---

## 3. High-Level Requirements

- **Automation:** Generate comprehensive, PMBOK-aligned project management documentation using AI.
- **Modularity:** Integrate as a module in any Node.js/TypeScript project.
- **API and CLI:** Support both programmatic API and command-line interface usage.
- **Structured Output:** Produce outputs in structured (JSON) formats for easy integration.
- **Compliance Coverage:** Include risk, compliance, and quality management sections in all documents.
- **Customizability:** Allow customization of generated documents with project-specific details.
- **Integration Support:** Enable use within CI/CD pipelines and various development workflows.
- **Security:** Secure handling of credentials and sensitive data (e.g., via dotenv, Azure authentication).
- **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive user guides and onboarding materials.
- **Testing & Quality:** (To Be Determined) Integrate testing, linting, and formatting tools to ensure code quality.

## 4. High-Level Project Description and Boundaries

**Description:**  
The Requirements Gathering Agent is a Node.js/TypeScript module that automates the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documents for software projects. It leverages Azure AI (and optionally OpenAI) to analyze project inputs and produce structured documentation, including charters, stakeholder registers, and management plans. The tool supports both API and CLI usage, enabling integration into various development workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

**Boundaries:**
- **In Scope:**
  - Automated generation of project management documentation (aligned with PMBOK).
  - Support for Node.js/TypeScript projects.
  - API and CLI interfaces.
  - Integration with Azure AI (primary) and OpenAI (optional/fallback).
  - Output in structured (JSON) format.
  - Documentation for installation, configuration, and usage.
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Persistent storage/database of documents (users must manage output storage).
  - Frontend/UI development.
  - Support for non-Node.js/TypeScript environments (initially).
  - Localization/internationalization (future consideration).
  - Automated project execution or tracking (focus is on documentation generation).

## 5. Overall Project Risk

The project faces a **moderate to high overall risk** due to:
- **Technical Risks:** Dependence on external AI APIs (Azure/OpenAI), potential inconsistencies in AI-generated outputs, lack of built-in testing/linting tools, and scalability concerns.
- **Project Management Risks:** Risk of scope creep, integration complexity, and resource constraints.
- **Security & Compliance Risks:** Handling of credentials, sensitive data exposure to AI providers, and evolving regulatory requirements.
- **Data Risks:** No persistent storage or built-in versioning; users must manage outputs.
- **External Risks:** Changes in PMBOK/regulatory standards and reliance on third-party libraries.

**Mitigation strategies** include robust error handling, clear MVP definition, phased releases, comprehensive documentation, integration of security best practices, and regular reviews of AI outputs and compliance.
