# **Project Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent**

---

## **1. Executive Summary**
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project is an AI-driven tool enabling automated generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. By leveraging Azure OpenAI and other AI providers, the tool simplifies the creation of comprehensive documentation, ensuring consistency, compliance, and reduced effort for project managers and business analysts. This project management plan adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and provides a structured approach to initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing the project.

---

## **2. Project Objectives**
The primary objectives of the Requirements Gathering Agent project are:
- Automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant documents, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, and risk management plans.
- Enable cross-document consistency and compliance validation to improve documentation quality.
- Enhance stakeholder engagement and reduce project documentation effort by 50%.
- Support integration with multiple AI providers and ensure scalability for future enhancements.

---

## **3. Project Constraints and Assumptions**
### Constraints:
- Available AI provider resources (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI).
- Budget allocated for development and testing.
- Compliance with PMBOK standards.
- Tools and frameworks limited to Node.js and TypeScript.

### Assumptions:
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback on generated documentation.
