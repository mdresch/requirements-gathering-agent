## Project Management Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This Project Management Plan (PMP) outlines the approach for delivering the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan encompasses all key knowledge areas and provides detailed guidance for project execution, monitoring, and control.

**1. Project Overview:**

* **Project Name:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API
* **Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name]
* **Project Sponsor:** [Insert Project Sponsor Name]
* **Start Date:** [Insert Start Date]
* **Planned Completion Date:** [Insert Planned Completion Date]
* **Project Goal:** To develop and deploy a production-ready API that generates BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks in seconds, significantly reducing requirements gathering time and improving quality.
* **Project Deliverables:**
    * Production-ready Express.js API (including documentation)
    * Comprehensive testing suite and reports
    * User documentation and training materials
    * Deployment to [Specify target environment, e.g., Azure]
    * Stakeholder register and communication plan

**2. Stakeholder Management:**

* **Stakeholders:** Development team, Product Owner, Business Analysts, Enterprise Users, Project Sponsor, IT Operations.
* **Stakeholder Register:** A detailed register will be maintained, including communication preferences and engagement strategies for each stakeholder group.  This will be updated regularly throughout the project.
* **Communication Plan:**  A communication plan will define communication methods (e.g., daily stand-ups, weekly reports, email, project portal), frequency, and responsible parties.

**3. Requirements Management:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  An RTM will track requirements from inception to implementation, ensuring all requirements are addressed and validated.  This will be a living document updated throughout the project.  The RTM will link functional and non-functional requirements to specific design components, test cases, and deliverables.
* **Requirements Documentation:**  The requirements will be documented in detail, including functional (FR) and non-functional (NFR) requirements, as outlined in the provided `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` and other related documents.  Any discrepancies or conflicts between documents will be resolved and documented.  Specific attention will be given to security requirements based on the chosen deployment environment.
* **Requirements Management Process:**  A formal process will be established for managing changes to requirements, including a change request form, review process, and impact assessment.

**4. Scope Management:**

* **Scope Statement:** The scope statement will be refined based on the provided README and associated documents, clearly defining what is included and excluded from the project.  A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be created to further decompose the project into manageable tasks and sub-tasks. The WBS will align with the project's Agile/Waterfall hybrid methodology.
* **Scope Baseline:** The approved scope statement and WBS will form the project scope baseline, against which changes will be managed.
* **Change Management Process:** A formal change control process will be established to manage changes to the project scope, including a change request form, impact assessment, and approval process.

**5. Schedule Management:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed project schedule will be developed using a suitable tool (e.g., Microsoft Project, Jira), incorporating task dependencies, durations, and resource assignments.  The schedule will be based on a hybrid Agile/Waterfall approach, using two-week sprints for development.
* **Critical Path Analysis:** Critical path analysis will be performed to identify tasks that are critical to project completion and to manage potential delays.
* **Schedule Baseline:** The approved project schedule will form the schedule baseline.
* **Schedule Control:** Regular monitoring and reporting of project progress against the schedule baseline will be performed.  Any schedule variances will be investigated and addressed through appropriate corrective actions.

**6. Cost Management:**

* **Cost Estimate:** A detailed cost estimate will be prepared, breaking down costs by category (e.g., personnel, software, hardware, infrastructure, training).  This will be based on resource allocation and market rates.
* **Budget Baseline:** The approved cost estimate will form the budget baseline.
* **Cost Control:**  Regular monitoring of actual costs against the budget baseline will be conducted.  Any cost variances will be investigated and addressed.  Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques will be used to track project performance.

**7. Quality Management:**

* **Quality Metrics:**  Specific quality metrics will be defined (e.g., defect density, test coverage, user satisfaction), aligned with the project's success criteria.
* **Quality Assurance (QA) Plan:** A comprehensive QA plan will be developed, outlining testing strategies (unit, integration, system, user acceptance testing), test cases, and defect tracking procedures.  The `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD` document will be a valuable resource for this plan.
* **Quality Control:**  Regular quality control activities will be performed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure adherence to quality standards.

**8. Risk Management:**

* **Risk Register:**  A risk register will be created, identifying potential risks (technical, resource, schedule, budget, external), assessing their probability and impact, and developing mitigation strategies. The provided documents will be reviewed for risk identification.
* **Risk Response Plan:** The risk response plan will detail the actions to be taken for each identified risk, including contingency plans.
* **Risk Monitoring and Control:** Regular monitoring of risks and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies will be performed.  The risk register will be updated as needed.

**9. Procurement Management (if applicable):**

* **Procurement Plan:** If any external procurements are required (e.g., third-party services), a procurement plan will be developed, outlining the procurement process, vendor selection criteria, and contract management procedures.

**10. Human Resource Management:**

* **Resource Plan:** A resource plan will outline the roles and responsibilities of each team member, their skills, and availability.
* **Team Management:** Effective team management techniques will be employed to ensure team cohesion, motivation, and productivity.  Regular team meetings and performance reviews will be conducted.

**11. Communications Management:**

* **Communication Plan (detailed):**  This plan will specify the communication methods, frequency, responsible parties, and audience for all project communications.  This will be tailored to the specific needs of each stakeholder group.

**12. Integration Management:**

* **Integration Approach:** The project will utilize a hybrid Agile/Waterfall approach, ensuring integration between different project phases and knowledge areas.  Regular meetings and reviews will be held to ensure alignment and coordination.

**13. Project Controls and Governance:**

* **Project Governance:** The project will adhere to established organizational governance processes.
* **Monitoring and Reporting:** Regular progress reports will be provided to stakeholders, using appropriate metrics and dashboards.
* **Change Control:** A formal change control process will be followed for managing changes to the project scope, schedule, and budget.


**14.  Technology and Architecture:**

*  The architecture will follow the API-first design principles detailed in the project README.  The `ARCHITECTURE.MD` document will be a key reference for the technical team.
*  The technology stack will be as outlined in the project metadata.  This will be reviewed and updated as needed.


**15.  Deployment Management:**

*  A detailed deployment plan will be created, covering the environment setup, testing, and deployment process. The `AZURE-PORTAL-API-CENTER-SETUP-GUIDE.MD` and `AZURE-PORTAL-API-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.MD` documents will guide this process.


**16. Project Closure:**

*  A project closure plan will be executed at the end of the project, including archiving of project documents, final reporting, and lessons learned documentation.


This PMP serves as a living document and will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect actual progress and any necessary adjustments.  The project team will adhere to the PMBOK guide and strive for excellence in all aspects of project delivery.
