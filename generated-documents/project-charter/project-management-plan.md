## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This Project Management Plan (PMP) outlines the approach for managing the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan leverages the existing project README and associated documentation as a key input.

**1. Project Charter:**

* **Project Goal:** Develop and release a robust, AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project context, primarily leveraging README.md and associated files.
* **Project Objectives:**
    * Achieve 100% PMBOK 7th Edition compliance in generated documents.
    * Achieve 95% accuracy in context extraction and interpretation.
    * Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars within 3 months of release.
    * Successfully integrate with at least three AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and one other).
    * Maintain a stable and performant application with less than 1% error rate.
* **Project Deliverables:**  A fully functional and tested Requirements Gathering Agent application, including comprehensive documentation (user guide, API documentation, etc.), and a deployment package.  Specific documents generated are listed in the project README.
* **Project Stakeholders:** Developers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, End-users.
* **Project Sponsor:**  [Insert Sponsor Name/Title]
* **Project Manager:** [Your Name/Title]
* **Budget:** [Insert Budget]
* **Timeline:** [Insert Timeline - e.g., 6 months]
* **Assumptions:**  Availability of necessary AI APIs, sufficient developer resources, and timely stakeholder feedback.
* **Constraints:** Budget limitations, API usage limits, and potential AI model limitations.


**2. Scope Management Plan:**

* **Project Scope:** The project scope is defined by the features listed in the project README.  The tool will generate the specified PMBOK documents based on analysis of project files, primarily markdown files.  Out-of-scope items include integration with specific third-party project management software beyond the AI providers.
* **Scope Baseline:** The initial scope definition, as documented in this PMP and the project README.
* **Scope Change Control Process:**  A formal process will be used to manage and approve any changes to the project scope, including a Change Request form, impact assessment, and approval by the project sponsor.


**3. Schedule Management Plan:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed Gantt chart or other schedule representation will be created, breaking down the project into tasks with assigned resources and durations.  This will be based on a work breakdown structure (WBS) derived from the project README and further detailed task breakdown.  (A sample WBS is provided below).
* **Scheduling Methodology:** Agile/Scrum or a similar iterative approach is recommended given the iterative nature of development and testing.
* **Critical Path:** The critical path will be identified and monitored closely to manage project timelines.


**4. Cost Management Plan:**

* **Budget:**  A detailed budget will be created, including costs for development resources, AI API usage, testing, and other relevant expenses.
* **Cost Baseline:**  The approved project budget.
* **Cost Control:**  Regular monitoring of actual costs against the budget will be performed, and corrective actions taken as needed.


**5. Quality Management Plan:**

* **Quality Standards:** Adherence to PMBOK 7th Edition standards, code quality standards (e.g., using linters), and achieving the defined objective metrics.
* **Quality Control:**  Unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing (UAT) will be conducted throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Quality Assurance:** Regular code reviews and documentation reviews will be performed.


**6. Resource Management Plan:**

* **Resource Requirements:** Developers with expertise in Node.js, TypeScript, and AI integration.  Testing resources. Project management resources.
* **Resource Allocation:** Assignment of tasks and responsibilities to team members.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Techniques to optimize resource utilization and avoid resource conflicts.


**7. Communications Management Plan:**

* **Communication Methods:** Regular team meetings, email updates, project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana), and stakeholder communication reports.
* **Communication Frequency:** Daily stand-ups, weekly progress reports, and monthly stakeholder meetings.
* **Communication Channels:**  Appropriate channels will be selected based on the audience and message.


**8. Risk Management Plan:**

* **Risk Identification:**  Potential risks include AI API limitations, unexpected bugs, delays in stakeholder feedback, and budget overruns.  A comprehensive risk register will be maintained.
* **Risk Response Planning:** Mitigation strategies will be developed for identified risks.  Contingency plans will be established for high-impact risks.


**9. Procurement Management Plan:**

* **Procurement Needs:**  AI API subscriptions, potentially third-party libraries or services.
* **Procurement Process:**  A formal procurement process will be followed, including vendor selection, contract negotiation, and vendor management.


**10. Stakeholder Management Plan:**

* **Stakeholder Identification:**  The stakeholders are listed in the Project Charter.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:**  A stakeholder analysis will be performed to understand stakeholder needs, expectations, and influence.
* **Stakeholder Engagement:**  A plan will be developed to engage stakeholders effectively throughout the project lifecycle.
