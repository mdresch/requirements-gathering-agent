## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Purpose & Objectives
The ADPA project aims to deliver a modular, PMBOK, BABOK, and DMBOK-compliant enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis. The solution leverages Node.js/TypeScript, a CLI/web interface, and a microservices architecture to address large-scale, standards-driven automation in Fortune 500 environments.

**Key Objectives:**
- Deliver a secure, scalable, and standards-compliant automation framework
- Enable rapid, AI-driven generation of professional project documentation
- Integrate with enterprise tools (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, VCS)
- Maintain compliance with major regulatory and security standards
- Achieve high end-user and stakeholder satisfaction

## 2. Project Scope Management

### 2.1 Scope Statement
**In Scope:**
- Requirements analysis, documentation, and validation
- Solution architecture and detailed design
- Full-stack (backend, frontend, CLI, API) development and testing
- Multi-framework document generation (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK)
- Integration with REST APIs, Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe PDF
- Automated workflows, admin portal, and analytics dashboard
- Security, compliance, and regulatory controls implementation
- Deployment, training, and post-go-live support

**Out of Scope:**
- On-premise deployments (initial phase)
- Industry-vertical customizations (may be future roadmap)

### 2.2 Scope Management Approach
- **Planning:** Detailed WBS and scope baseline established at project start
- **Definition:** Requirements captured via stakeholder workshops, BA inputs
- **Verification:** Deliverable reviews, formal acceptance by sponsor
- **Control:** Strict change control via Change Control Board (CCB); all scope changes require documented impact analysis and CCB approval
