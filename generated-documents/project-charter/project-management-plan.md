# Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 1.0)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Project Management Plan (PMP) for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project, adhering to PMBOK Guide standards.  The project aims to deliver a robust, AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  This plan details the approach for successful project execution, monitoring, and control throughout its lifecycle.

## 2. Project Overview

**2.1 Project Goal:** To develop and deploy a reliable, scalable, and user-friendly application that automatically generates PMBOK-compliant project management documentation using AI.

**2.2 Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a system capable of generating at least the following PMBOK documents: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Statement, WBS, Risk Register, and Communication Plan.
*   Integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI, etc.) with a flexible mechanism for switching providers.
*   Provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use and configuration.
*   Implement robust error handling and logging.
*   Maintain a modular and extensible architecture for future enhancements.
*   Achieve 95% test coverage.
*   Complete the project within [Insert Timeframe - e.g., 12 weeks].
*   Remain within the approved budget of [Insert Budget].

**2.3 Project Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional Requirements Gathering Agent application.
*   Comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and FAQs.
*   Automated testing suite with high test coverage.
*   Deployment scripts for various environments.


## 3. Project Scope

**3.1 Project Scope:** The project encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of the Requirements Gathering Agent application.  It explicitly excludes the implementation of sophisticated security features (beyond basic authentication and authorization as defined in the requirements) and integration with specific enterprise systems (unless explicitly added via a change request).

**3.2 Scope Management Plan:**  A formal change control process will be implemented using a Change Request form. All change requests will be evaluated based on impact on schedule, budget, and scope. Approved changes will be documented and incorporated into the project plan.


## 4. Schedule Management

**4.1 Project Schedule:**  [Insert Gantt chart or similar visual representation of the project schedule, including key milestones and dependencies.  Milestones should align with the objectives and deliverables mentioned above.  Consider using a tool like MS Project or Jira.]

**4.2 Schedule Control:**  Progress will be monitored weekly using Agile sprint methodologies.  The project manager will hold regular stand-up meetings with the development team to track progress and identify potential schedule risks.  Any deviations from the schedule will be addressed through the change control process.


## 5. Cost Management

**5.1 Budget:** [Insert detailed budget breakdown, including personnel costs, software licenses, hardware, cloud services, and contingency funds.]

**5.2 Cost Control:**  Costs will be tracked monthly against the approved budget.  Variance analysis will be performed to identify any cost overruns and corrective actions will be implemented.


## 6. Quality Management

**6.1 Quality Standards:**  The application will adhere to industry best practices for software development, including adherence to coding standards, thorough testing, and code reviews.  Specific quality metrics (e.g., defect density, test coverage) will be defined and tracked.

**6.2 Quality Assurance:**  A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  Automated testing will be employed where possible.


## 7. Human Resource Management

**7.1 Project Team:**  [List team members, their roles, and responsibilities.]

**7.2 Resource Allocation:**  [Describe how resources will be allocated to different tasks and phases of the project.]


## 8. Communications Management

**8.1 Communication Plan:**  Regular communication will be maintained with stakeholders through various channels:

*   **Daily Stand-up Meetings:** For the development team.
*   **Weekly Status Reports:** To the project sponsor and other key stakeholders.
*   **Monthly Progress Meetings:**  For more detailed reviews.
*   **Project Management Software (e.g., Jira):** For task management and progress tracking.

**8.2 Communication Methods:**  Email, project management software, and regular meetings.


## 9. Risk Management

**9.1 Risk Register:** [Create a table listing potential risks, their probability, impact, and mitigation strategies. Examples include:]

| Risk                      | Probability | Impact     | Mitigation Strategy                                          |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI Provider API Downtime   | Medium       | High       | Implement failover mechanisms to alternative providers.       |
| Unexpected Technical Issues | Low          | Medium     | Allocate contingency time for problem-solving.                |
| Scope Creep                | Medium       | Medium     | Strict adherence to the change control process.             |
| Resource Availability     | Low          | Medium     | Proactive resource planning and contingency staffing.         |


**9.2 Risk Response Plan:**  The project team will regularly review the risk register and implement the defined mitigation strategies.  Contingency plans will be developed to address high-impact risks.


## 10. Procurement Management (If Applicable)

[If the project involves external procurement, describe the process for selecting and managing vendors.]


## 11. Stakeholder Management

**11.1 Stakeholder Register:** [Create a table listing all stakeholders, their roles, communication preferences, and their level of influence and interest in the project.]

**11.2 Stakeholder Engagement Plan:**  Regular communication and feedback mechanisms will be established to ensure stakeholder satisfaction and address concerns promptly.


## 12. Integration Management

The project will utilize an iterative development approach, integrating different components and functionalities throughout the project lifecycle.  Regular integration testing will be performed to ensure seamless interaction between modules.


## 13. Project Closure

The project will be formally closed upon successful completion of all deliverables and acceptance by stakeholders.  A post-project review will be conducted to document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement in future projects.


## 14. Appendix

This section will include supporting documents such as the project charter, detailed WBS, risk register, communication plan, and stakeholder register.


This PMP serves as a dynamic document and will be updated regularly to reflect the actual progress and any necessary adjustments to the project plan.  The project manager will be responsible for maintaining and communicating updates to the PMP.
