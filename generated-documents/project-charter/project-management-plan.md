# Project Management Plan: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Project Management Plan (PMP) for the development and deployment of the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) framework.  This plan adheres to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide â€“ Seventh Edition, providing a comprehensive framework for managing the project throughout its lifecycle.

**1.1 Project Goals and Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** Successfully develop, test, and deploy a robust, scalable, and secure ADPA framework that meets defined business requirements and industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0).
* **Objectives:**
    * Develop a functional CLI and REST API.
    * Integrate with at least three AI providers (Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Azure OpenAI).
    * Implement integrations with Confluence and SharePoint.
    * Achieve 95% code test coverage.
    * Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 90% or higher.
    * Complete the project within the allocated budget and timeline.


**2. Project Scope Management**

**2.1 Project Scope Statement:** The project encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of the ADPA framework, including its CLI, REST API, AI integrations, and document generation capabilities.  Specific features are detailed in the provided project context.  Out-of-scope items include integration with all listed enterprise systems (prioritization will be defined in a separate document).

**2.2 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A detailed WBS will be created and maintained in a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Microsoft Project).  It will decompose the project into manageable tasks, assigning responsibilities and estimated durations.  The high-level WBS includes:

* **1.0 Project Initiation:** Project charter creation, stakeholder identification, kickoff meeting.
* **2.0 Requirements Gathering:**  Detailed requirements analysis using BABOK v3.
* **3.0 Design:** System architecture design, API design (TypeSpec), database design.
* **4.0 Development:**  CLI development, API development, AI integration, document generation engine development.
* **5.0 Testing:** Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).
* **6.0 Deployment:** Deployment to staging and production environments.
* **7.0 Training and Documentation:** Creation of user documentation and training materials.
* **8.0 Project Closure:** Final reporting, lessons learned documentation, project sign-off.


**3. Schedule Management**

**3.1 Project Schedule:** A detailed project schedule, including task dependencies, durations, and milestones, will be developed and tracked using a project management tool.  The high-level schedule will be based on the roadmap provided (Q2 2025 and Q3 2025 milestones), with specific task durations determined during detailed planning.

**3.2 Critical Path Analysis:**  Critical path analysis will be performed regularly to identify tasks impacting the overall project timeline and to proactively manage potential delays.

**3.3 Schedule Control:**  A formal change control process will be implemented to manage any changes to the project schedule.  All schedule changes will be documented, assessed for impact, and approved by the Project Manager.


**4. Cost Management**

**4.1 Budget:** A detailed budget will be developed, allocating costs to various project activities (personnel, software licenses, hardware, etc.).  Contingency funds will be included to account for unforeseen expenses.

**4.2 Cost Control:**  Regular cost tracking and reporting will be performed to monitor budget adherence.  Variance analysis will be conducted to identify and address any cost overruns.  A change control process will manage budget modifications.


**5. Quality Management**

**5.1 Quality Standards:** The project will adhere to industry best practices and coding standards (e.g., TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier).

**5.2 Quality Assurance:**  A comprehensive quality assurance plan will be implemented, including code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and UAT.  Test coverage targets will be defined.

**5.3 Quality Control:**  Defect tracking and resolution will be managed using a defect tracking system.  Regular quality audits will be conducted to ensure compliance with quality standards.


**6. Human Resource Management**

**6.1 Project Team:** The project team will consist of developers, a technical lead, a business analyst, a DevOps engineer, and a project manager.  Roles and responsibilities will be clearly defined.

**6.2 Resource Allocation:**  Resources will be allocated based on skills, availability, and task dependencies.  Resource leveling will be performed to optimize resource utilization.

**6.3 Team Management:**  Regular team meetings, communication, and performance reviews will be conducted to foster collaboration and ensure project success.


**7. Communications Management**

**7.1 Communication Plan:** A communication plan will be developed, defining communication channels (e.g., email, project management tool, team meetings), frequency of communication, and stakeholders involved.

**7.2 Reporting:** Regular status reports, progress updates, and risk reports will be provided to stakeholders.


**8. Risk Management**

**8.1 Risk Identification:** Potential risks will be identified, categorized (technical, schedule, cost, resource, etc.), and analyzed for probability and impact.

**8.2 Risk Response Planning:**  Mitigation strategies will be developed for identified risks.

**8.3 Risk Monitoring and Control:** Risks will be monitored throughout the project lifecycle, and mitigation strategies will be implemented as needed.  The risk register will be updated regularly.


**9. Procurement Management**

**9.1 Procurement Strategy:**  A procurement strategy will be defined for any necessary third-party software, hardware, or services.

**9.2 Vendor Selection:**  Vendors will be selected based on predefined criteria (e.g., cost, experience, reputation).


**10. Stakeholder Management**

**10.1 Stakeholder Register:** A stakeholder register will be created, identifying key stakeholders, their interests, and their influence on the project.

**10.2 Stakeholder Engagement Plan:** A stakeholder engagement plan will be developed, outlining communication strategies and methods for managing stakeholder expectations.


**11. Integration Management**

**11.1 Project Integration:**  The project manager will ensure integration of all project management knowledge areas.

**11.2 Change Management:**  A formal change control process will be implemented to manage changes to the project scope, schedule, and budget.


**12. Project Closure**

**12.1 Project Closure Procedures:**  A project closure plan will be developed and executed, including final reporting, documentation archiving, and lessons learned capture.


**13.  Appendix**

This section will include supporting documents such as the detailed WBS, project schedule, budget, risk register, stakeholder register, and communication plan.


This PMP serves as a living document, subject to review and updates as the project progresses.  Regular project status meetings and reviews will ensure that the plan remains aligned with project realities and stakeholder expectations.
