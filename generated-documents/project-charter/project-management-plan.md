- Achieve full compliance with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and initial DMBOK 2.0.
- Integrate with major enterprise platforms (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, SSO, VCS).
- Achieve stakeholder satisfaction and operational sustainability.

### 1.3 Success Factors
- Clear and proactive stakeholder engagement.
- Rigorous risk, quality, and change management.
- Timely, high-quality, standards-compliant deliverables.
