## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This plan adheres to the PMBOK 7th Edition standards and utilizes the provided project README and supplementary documentation as inputs.

**1. Project Charter:**

* **Project Goal:** Develop and release a robust, AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project metadata and existing documentation.
* **Project Objectives:**
    * Achieve 90% PMBOK 7.0 compliance in generated documents.
    * Achieve 95% accuracy in identifying and prioritizing relevant project information.
    * Achieve an average user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.
    * Maintain a 99.9% uptime for the tool's API.
* **High-Level Requirements:**  As detailed in the provided README.md (Features section).
* **Stakeholders:** Developers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, End-users.
* **Project Manager:** [Your Name/Team Name]
* **Project Sponsor:** [Name of Sponsor/Organization]
* **Budget:** [Insert Budget]
* **Timeline:** [Insert Timeline -  consider phases: Development, Testing, Release, Maintenance]
* **Assumptions:**  Sufficient access to Azure OpenAI and other AI providers; consistent availability of project documentation.
* **Constraints:**  Budget limitations;  potential API rate limits; reliance on third-party AI services.


**2. Project Scope Statement:**

* **Project Deliverables:**  The Requirements Gathering Agent software application (including CLI, API, and supporting documentation),  along with comprehensive testing and deployment documentation. Specific documents generated by the tool are listed in the README.md.
* **Project Exclusions:**  Integration with third-party project management software (future enhancement); support for non-markdown file types beyond what is currently supported (future enhancement).
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Successful generation of PMBOK-compliant documents meeting predefined quality metrics (accuracy, completeness, consistency); successful completion of all planned testing phases; positive user feedback.


**3. Requirements Management Plan:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix will be created to link requirements to specific design components, test cases, and deliverables.  (This will be dynamically generated and updated during development).
* **Requirements Gathering Techniques:**  Analysis of README.md, supplementary documents, stakeholder interviews (if necessary).
* **Requirements Prioritization:**  Prioritization will be based on a combination of stakeholder input, business value, and technical feasibility.  The existing README scoring mechanism will be utilized.
* **Requirements Management Tools:**  Jira, Confluence, or similar tool for tracking and managing requirements.


**4. Schedule Management Plan:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed Gantt chart or similar schedule will be created, outlining tasks, dependencies, durations, and milestones. This will be broken down into phases (Development, Testing, Release, Post-Release).  (Example:  Agile Sprint methodology).
* **Critical Path Analysis:**  Identify critical path tasks to ensure timely completion.
* **Scheduling Tools:**  Microsoft Project, Asana, or similar project management software.


**5. Cost Management Plan:**

* **Budget Breakdown:**  Detailed breakdown of costs associated with development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
* **Cost Estimation Techniques:**  Bottom-up estimation based on task durations and resource costs.
* **Cost Control Mechanisms:**  Regular budget monitoring, variance analysis, and contingency planning.


**6. Quality Management Plan:**

* **Quality Metrics:**  PMBOK compliance score, accuracy of generated documents, user satisfaction rating, API uptime.
* **Quality Control Activities:**  Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).
* **Quality Assurance Activities:**  Code reviews, design reviews, documentation reviews.
* **Defect Tracking:**  Jira, Bugzilla, or similar defect tracking system.


**7. Resource Management Plan:**

* **Resource Identification:**  Identify and allocate necessary resources (personnel, hardware, software, AI services).
* **Resource Allocation:**  Assign resources to tasks based on skills and availability.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Adjust resource allocation to optimize resource utilization and prevent resource conflicts.


**8. Communications Management Plan:**

* **Stakeholder Communication Matrix:**  Define communication channels, frequency, and methods for each stakeholder group.
* **Communication Methods:**  Email, meetings, project management software updates.
* **Reporting:**  Regular progress reports, status updates, and issue logs.


**9. Risk Management Plan:**

* **Risk Identification:**  Identify potential risks (e.g., API downtime, budget overruns, technical challenges).
* **Risk Assessment:**  Assess the probability and impact of each risk.
* **Risk Response Planning:**  Develop mitigation strategies for high-priority risks.
* **Risk Monitoring and Control:**  Regularly monitor risks and update risk responses as needed.


**10. Procurement Management Plan (if applicable):**

* This section would detail any external procurement activities (e.g., purchasing cloud services, contracting with third-party vendors).  Currently, this section is not applicable based on the README provided.


**11. Stakeholder Management Plan:**

* **Stakeholder Analysis:**  Identify key stakeholders, their interests, and their influence on the project.  The existing README contains a good starting point for this.
* **Stakeholder Engagement Plan:**  Define strategies for engaging stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Stakeholder Communication Plan:**  As defined in the Communications Management Plan.


**12.  Team Management Plan:**

*  Define team roles and responsibilities.
*  Establish communication protocols within the team.
*  Outline the process for conflict resolution.
*  Specify methods for performance management and evaluation.


**13.  Project Controls:**

*  Regular monitoring and tracking of progress against the project plan.
*  Identification and management of changes.
*  Reporting of performance metrics.


This Project Management Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in scope, schedule, or other relevant factors.  The iterative nature of the development (as implied by the README) will require flexible adaptation of this plan.
