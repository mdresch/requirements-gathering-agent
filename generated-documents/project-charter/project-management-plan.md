## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This Project Management Plan (PMP) outlines the approach for managing the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan leverages the existing project README and associated documentation as a starting point.

**1. Project Charter:**

* **Project Goal:**  Develop and release a robust, AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project metadata and existing documentation.
* **Project Objectives:**  Achieve 1000 weekly downloads within 6 months of release; achieve a 4.5-star rating on npm; maintain 99% uptime; achieve 95% user satisfaction.
* **Project Deliverables:**  A fully functional and tested Requirements Gathering Agent application (CLI and API), comprehensive documentation (user guide, API documentation, etc.), deployment to npm, and a marketing plan.
* **Project Stakeholders:** Developers, PMO, Marketing team, Users (project managers, business analysts).
* **Project Sponsor:** [Insert Sponsor Name/Title]
* **Project Manager:** [Your Name/Title]
* **Budget:** [Insert Budget]
* **Timeline:** [Insert Timeline - e.g., 6 months]
* **Assumptions:**  Availability of necessary AI APIs, sufficient developer resources, stable project requirements.
* **Constraints:** Budget limitations, API usage limits, time constraints.
* **Risks:**  API downtime, unexpected changes in AI model capabilities, competition.

**2. Project Scope Statement:**

This project will focus on the development and release of the Requirements Gathering Agent, including all features outlined in the README.  Out-of-scope items include integration with specific third-party project management tools (initially), and extensive customizability beyond the CLI options.

**3. Requirements Management Plan:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix will be created to link requirements (from README and other documentation) to design, development, and testing activities.
* **Requirements Elicitation Techniques:**  Review of existing documentation, stakeholder interviews (if needed).
* **Requirements Prioritization:**  Prioritization will be based on the impact and feasibility of each requirement, using a MoSCoW method.
* **Requirements Management Tools:**  Jira, Confluence (or alternatives).

**4. Schedule Management Plan:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed Gantt chart will be created outlining tasks, dependencies, durations, and milestones.  This will be managed using a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Critical Path Analysis:**  The critical path will be identified to ensure timely completion.
* **Schedule Baseline:**  The approved project schedule will serve as the baseline against which progress will be measured.
* **Contingency Planning:**  A buffer will be included in the schedule to account for potential delays.

**5. Cost Management Plan:**

* **Budget Breakdown:**  The budget will be broken down into categories (e.g., personnel costs, API usage fees, infrastructure costs).
* **Cost Estimation Techniques:**  Bottom-up estimation will be used based on task durations and resource rates.
* **Cost Control Techniques:**  Regular monitoring of actual costs against the budget, variance analysis.
* **Contingency Reserve:**  A reserve will be allocated to address unforeseen costs.

**6. Quality Management Plan:**

* **Quality Metrics:**  Code coverage, test pass rate, user satisfaction scores, bug reports.
* **Quality Control:**  Code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing.
* **Quality Assurance:**  Regular monitoring of quality metrics, proactive identification and resolution of quality issues.
* **Compliance:**  Adherence to PMBOK standards and coding best practices.

**7. Resource Management Plan:**

* **Resource Requirements:**  Developers (Frontend, Backend), Project Manager, Testers.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Assignment of resources to tasks based on skills and availability.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Balancing workload across resources to optimize productivity.
* **Team Communication:**  Regular team meetings, communication channels (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).

**8. Communications Management Plan:**

* **Communication Methods:**  Team meetings, email, project management tool updates, regular status reports to stakeholders.
* **Communication Frequency:**  Daily stand-ups, weekly status reports, monthly progress reports.
* **Communication Stakeholders:**  Developers, PMO, Marketing team, Users.
* **Communication Channels:**  Jira, email, Slack.

**9. Risk Management Plan:**

* **Risk Identification:**  Potential risks identified in the project charter will be elaborated upon (API downtime, AI model limitations, etc.).
* **Risk Analysis:**  Risks will be analyzed based on probability and impact.
* **Risk Response Planning:**  Mitigation strategies will be developed for high-priority risks (e.g., having backup AI providers, contingency plans for API outages).
* **Risk Monitoring and Control:**  Regular monitoring of identified risks, and adjustments to risk response plans as needed.

**10. Procurement Management Plan:**

* **Procurement Needs:**  Cloud services (Azure), potential third-party libraries.
* **Procurement Process:**  Selection of vendors, contract negotiation, purchase orders.

**11. Stakeholder Management Plan:**

* **Stakeholder Identification:**  Identify all stakeholders (as outlined in the project charter).
* **Stakeholder Analysis:**  Assess stakeholders' interests, influence, and potential impact on the project.
* **Stakeholder Engagement:**  Develop a communication plan to keep stakeholders informed and engaged throughout the project.
* **Issue Log:**  Maintain a log to track and address stakeholder concerns.


**12. Project Controls:**

* **Performance Reporting:**  Regular reporting of project progress, including earned value analysis (EVA).
* **Change Management:**  A formal process will be established for managing changes to the project scope, schedule, or budget.
* **Monitoring and Controlling:**  Continuous monitoring of project performance against the baseline plan, with corrective actions taken as needed.


This Project Management Plan serves as a living document and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure that the plan remains relevant and effective.
