## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This plan adheres to the PMBOK 7th Edition standards and utilizes information extracted from the provided project README and supplementary documents.

**1. Project Charter:**

* **Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent
* **Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name]
* **Sponsor:** [Insert Sponsor Name]
* **Project Start Date:** [Insert Start Date]
* **Project End Date:** [Insert End Date] (This will need to be estimated based on the scope and resources)
* **Project Goals:** Automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation using AI, improving efficiency and consistency.  Achieve a minimum of [Target Number] weekly downloads within [Timeframe].
* **Project Deliverables:**  A fully functional Node.js/TypeScript CLI application capable of generating 29 PMBOK-compliant documents (listed in the README), including a comprehensive validation suite and enhanced context management system.
* **Key Stakeholders:** Developers, Project Managers, Business Analysts, and end-users.
* **High-Level Requirements:**  As detailed in the README, including functional and non-functional requirements.
* **Assumptions:**  Sufficient access to Azure OpenAI (or alternative AI providers) and necessary computing resources.  Availability of relevant project documentation for analysis.
* **Constraints:** Budget limitations (to be defined), timeline constraints (to be defined), and potential API limitations of AI providers.
* **Risks:** API downtime, changes in AI provider pricing or service offerings, and unexpected technical challenges during development.


**2. Project Scope Statement:**

The project scope encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of the Requirements Gathering Agent application.  This includes all features listed in the README, the development of comprehensive documentation, and the implementation of a robust testing and validation framework.  Out of scope are:  Integration with third-party PM tools beyond initial JSON output (future phase), and support for non-markdown document types (future phase).


**3. Requirements Management Plan:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix will be created to link requirements (from the README and supplementary documents) to design elements, test cases, and deliverables.
* **Requirements Elicitation:**  Requirements have been primarily elicited from the README and supplementary documents.  Further elicitation may be necessary through stakeholder interviews or surveys.
* **Requirements Analysis:**  Requirements analysis is ongoing, with prioritization based on impact and feasibility.
* **Requirements Validation:**  Validation will occur through code reviews, unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.


**4. Schedule Management Plan:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed project schedule (Gantt chart or other suitable method) will be created, outlining tasks, dependencies, durations, and milestones.  This will be based on the work breakdown structure (WBS).
* **Critical Path Analysis:** The critical path will be identified to highlight tasks that require close monitoring to avoid delays.
* **Progress Monitoring:** Progress will be monitored regularly using Agile methodologies (e.g., sprints) and reporting tools.


**5. Cost Management Plan:**

* **Budget:** A detailed budget will be created, including costs for development resources, AI provider APIs, testing, and deployment.
* **Cost Estimation:**  Bottom-up estimation will be used, breaking down the project into individual tasks and assigning cost estimates to each.
* **Cost Control:**  Costs will be tracked and controlled throughout the project lifecycle.


**6. Quality Management Plan:**

* **Quality Standards:**  The project will adhere to PMBOK standards and best practices for software development.  Code quality will be maintained through code reviews, unit testing, and static analysis.
* **Quality Assurance:**  A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
* **Quality Control:**  Regular reviews and inspections will be conducted to ensure that quality standards are met.


**7. Resource Management Plan:**

* **Resource Identification:**  Identify all resources required for the project, including personnel, software, and hardware.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Allocate resources to tasks based on their skills and availability.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Level resources to avoid over-allocation and ensure timely completion.


**8. Communications Management Plan:**

* **Communication Methods:**  Regular team meetings, email updates, and project management software (e.g., Jira) will be used for communication.
* **Communication Frequency:**  Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders.
* **Communication Channels:**  Defined channels for different stakeholder groups will be established.


**9. Risk Management Plan:**

* **Risk Identification:**  Risks identified in the project charter will be further elaborated on and prioritized.
* **Risk Analysis:**  Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis will be performed.
* **Risk Response Planning:**  Mitigation strategies will be developed for identified risks.
* **Risk Monitoring and Control:**  Risks will be monitored throughout the project lifecycle.


**10. Procurement Management Plan:** (If applicable, based on external services needed)

* **Procurement Strategy:**  Define the approach to procurement of any external services or resources.
* **Vendor Selection:**  Identify and select vendors based on pre-defined criteria.
* **Contract Management:**  Manage contracts with vendors throughout the project.


**11. Stakeholder Management Plan:**

* **Stakeholder Register:**  A register will document all stakeholders, their interests, and their influence.
* **Stakeholder Engagement Plan:** A plan to engage stakeholders at appropriate times and through appropriate methods.


**12. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

A detailed WBS will be created to decompose the project into manageable tasks.  This will serve as the basis for the project schedule and cost estimates.  An example high-level WBS:

* 1.0 Project Initiation
* 2.0 Requirements Gathering and Analysis
* 3.0 Design and Development
    * 3.1 Context Management System
    * 3.2 AI Provider Integration
    * 3.3 Document Generation Engine
    * 3.4 CLI Interface
* 4.0 Testing and Validation
* 5.0 Deployment and Documentation
* 6.0 Project Closure


**13.  Project Controls:**

Regular monitoring and reporting against the project plan will be conducted using appropriate tools and techniques.  This includes tracking progress against the schedule, budget, and scope.  Variance analysis will be performed to identify and address deviations from the plan.


**14.  Change Management Plan:**

A formal process for managing changes to the project scope, schedule, and budget will be established.  This process will include a change request form, review process, and approval authority.


This Project Management Plan is a living document and will be updated as the project progresses.  Specific details, such as timelines and budget, will be refined and finalized in subsequent project planning meetings.
