## Project Management Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Project Management Plan (PMP) for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, adhering to PMBOK 7th edition standards.  ADPA aims to deliver an AI-powered tool automating the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This plan details the approach for successful project execution, monitoring, and control.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

* **Goal:** Develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered tool that generates high-quality, PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* **Objectives:**
    * Achieve 95% accuracy in generated documentation as measured by PMBOK compliance validation.
    * Complete development within 22 weeks.
    * Remain within the approved budget of [Insert Budget Amount].
    * Achieve a stakeholder satisfaction rating of 90% or higher.
    * Successfully integrate with Azure OpenAI and at least one alternative AI provider (e.g., Google AI).
    * Implement a comprehensive version control system for generated documents.


**3. Project Scope**

The project scope encompasses the development, testing, and deployment of ADPA, including:

* **In-Scope:**
    * Core PMBOK document generation (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, etc.).
    * Technical design document generation (Architecture Design, System Design, etc.).
    * Strategic business communication generation (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.).
    * Comprehensive project analysis using enhanced context management.
    * PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and quality assessment.
    * User-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI).
    * Integrated version control system.
    * Documentation (User Guide, Technical Documentation).

* **Out-of-Scope:**
    * Integration with third-party project management software (initially).
    * Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
    * Support for non-markdown document formats (initially).


**4. Project Stakeholders**

* **Project Sponsor:** [Insert Name and Title]
* **Project Manager:** [Insert Name and Title]
* **Development Team:** [List Team Members and Roles]
* **QA Team:** [List Team Members and Roles]
* **End-Users:** Project Managers, Business Analysts, etc.


**5. Project Schedule**

The project will be executed in phases, with key milestones and timelines defined in the detailed project schedule (Appendix A).  The schedule will utilize a hybrid Agile/Waterfall approach, incorporating 2-week sprints for development and iterative stakeholder feedback.


**6. Project Budget**

A detailed budget breakdown is provided in Appendix B. The budget will be monitored and controlled through regular variance analysis and earned value management.


**7. Quality Management Plan**

The project will adhere to rigorous quality standards, including:

* **Coding Standards:**  Adherence to established coding best practices and style guides.
* **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and system testing will be performed. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will involve end-users.
* **Validation:**  Generated documents will be validated against PMBOK 7.0 standards and undergo quality assessment.
* **Documentation:**  Thorough documentation will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle.


**8. Risk Management Plan**

Potential risks and mitigation strategies are identified in Appendix C.  Risks will be monitored and addressed proactively through regular risk reviews and contingency planning.  Key risks include:

* **Technical Challenges:**  Complexity of AI integration and document generation.  Mitigation: Phased implementation, thorough testing, expert consultation.
* **Schedule Delays:**  Unforeseen technical issues or stakeholder delays. Mitigation: Agile methodology, buffer time in the schedule, proactive communication.
* **Budget Overruns:**  Unexpected costs related to technology or resources. Mitigation: Detailed budget tracking, contingency planning, value engineering.
* **AI Provider Limitations:**  Limitations in AI model capabilities or API availability. Mitigation: Multi-provider support, fallback mechanisms, contingency plans.


**9. Communication Management Plan**

A detailed communication plan is outlined in Appendix D. This includes:

* **Regular Meetings:** Daily stand-ups, weekly status meetings, monthly progress reviews with stakeholders.
* **Reporting:** Weekly status reports to the project sponsor and monthly reports to the steering committee.
* **Communication Tools:** Project management software (e.g., Jira), collaboration tools (e.g., Slack/Microsoft Teams), email.


**10. Human Resource Management Plan**

The project team structure is detailed in Appendix E.  This plan includes roles, responsibilities, and resource allocation.


**11. Procurement Management Plan**

This project requires procurement of software licenses for AI providers.  The procurement process will follow a formal procedure, including vendor selection, contract negotiation, and vendor management. Details are provided in Appendix F.


**12. Stakeholder Management Plan**

A stakeholder register (Appendix G) identifies key stakeholders and their interests.  Engagement strategies will be tailored to each stakeholder group, ensuring regular communication and feedback loops.


**13. Change Management Plan**

A formal change control process will be implemented to manage any changes to the project scope, schedule, or budget.  All change requests will be documented, evaluated, and approved by the change control board.


**14. Project Monitoring and Control**

The project will be monitored and controlled through:

* **Regular Progress Reporting:**  Tracking progress against the schedule and budget.
* **Performance Measurement:**  Using earned value management and key performance indicators (KPIs).
* **Issue Tracking:**  Maintaining an issue log and implementing a resolution process.
* **Change Control:**  Managing changes through the formal change control process.


**15. Project Closure**

Project closure will involve:

* Final deliverable verification and acceptance.
* Project performance evaluation and lessons learned documentation.
* Team recognition and celebration.
* Archiving of project documentation.
* Transition of ADPA to operations and maintenance.
