# Project Charter: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

**Charter Date:** June 23, 2025
**Project Manager:** [TO BE ASSIGNED]
**Executive Sponsor:** [EXECUTIVE SPONSOR NAME]
**PMO Director:** [PMO DIRECTOR NAME]

## 1. Executive Summary

This project charters the development and deployment of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, a revolutionary platform automating the generation of BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  This initiative directly addresses the critical need for significant time reduction (90% projected) in requirements gathering for large-scale enterprise projects, a key strategic objective outlined in [Reference Business Case Document Section X].  The platform's ability to deliver Fortune 500-quality deliverables in seconds, validated through a successful $2B+ modernization program case study with GlobalBank (see Appendix A), represents a transformative leap in business analysis efficiency and quality.  This project aligns directly with the organization's strategic priorities of [Reference Corporate Strategy Document Section Y], specifically targeting [Specific Strategic Goal Z].  The projected ROI, detailed in [Reference Business Case Document Section W], justifies the allocated resources and demonstrates a significant return on investment.  This charter grants full authority to the Project Manager to execute this initiative within the parameters defined herein.


## 2. Project Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives:**

1. **Deliver a production-ready API:**  Successfully deploy a stable, secure, and scalable API capable of generating BABOK v3 compliant frameworks.  Success will be measured by achieving 99.9% uptime and successfully processing [Number] requests per day within [Timeframe].
2. **Achieve 90% time reduction in requirements gathering:** Demonstrate a 90% reduction in the time required to generate BABOK v3 frameworks compared to traditional methods.
