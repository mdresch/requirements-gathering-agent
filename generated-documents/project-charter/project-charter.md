## 1. Executive Summary

This Project Charter authorizes the initiation of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA represents a paradigm shift in AI-powered project management, moving beyond simple document generation to deliver Evaluative Contextual Synthesis and Hierarchical Authority Recognition.  This breakthrough technology autonomously generates comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation, including technical design documents, strategic business communications, and all necessary project management artifacts.  The project's strategic alignment is rooted in addressing the significant time and resource inefficiencies associated with manual project documentation, while simultaneously enhancing accuracy, compliance, and stakeholder alignment. The projected ROI, detailed in the accompanying Business Case, justifies the allocated resources and expected return on investment.  This initiative directly supports [mention specific corporate strategic goal(s) â€“ synthesize from Business Case].

## 2. Project Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives:**

1. **Automate PMBOK Documentation:**  Reduce manual effort in creating project documentation by at least 75%, as measured by time tracking comparisons between manual and ADPA-generated documents in a pilot project.
2. **Enhance Documentation Quality:** Achieve an average document quality score of 95% or higher across all generated PMBOK artifacts, as assessed by the built-in quality assessment module and validated by subject matter experts.
3. **Ensure PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:** Achieve 100% compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards across all generated documents, as verified by the built-in validation system.
4. **Improve Stakeholder Alignment:** Achieve a stakeholder satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 (based on post-project surveys) regarding the quality and usefulness of ADPA-generated documentation.
5. **Achieve Market Penetration:** Secure 500 weekly downloads within six months of launch, demonstrating strong market acceptance.


**Success Criteria:**  Successful project completion will be defined by the achievement of all primary objectives outlined above.  Failure to meet any single objective will trigger a project review and potential mitigation strategies.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  Project progress and success will be monitored through weekly status reports tracking progress against primary objectives, document quality scores, PMBOK compliance, stakeholder feedback scores, and weekly NPM download counts.  A detailed KPI dashboard will be provided to the Executive Sponsor on a bi-weekly basis.

## 3. Project Scope and Deliverables

**High-Level Scope:** The project encompasses the full development, testing, deployment, and initial support of the ADPA application. This includes building a robust and scalable application capable of generating a comprehensive suite of PMBOK documents, integrating with multiple AI providers, and providing a user-friendly CLI interface.
