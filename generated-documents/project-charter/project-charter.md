**Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent**

**1. Project Purpose:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documentation based on project context derived from various sources, including but not limited to README files, requirements documents, and architecture specifications.  The tool will support multiple AI providers and offer advanced context management capabilities.

**2. Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a Node.js/TypeScript based command-line interface (CLI) tool.
*   Integrate with at least three AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and GitHub AI).
*   Implement an intelligent context manager capable of handling up to 2M tokens.
*   Generate at least 29 PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documents.
*   Achieve 90% accuracy in PMBOK compliance validation.
*   Maintain a user-friendly interface and clear documentation.
*   Successfully release a production-ready version to npm.

**3. Project Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional CLI tool (requirements-gathering-agent).
*   Comprehensive user documentation (including tutorials and troubleshooting guides).
*   Automated testing suite with high code coverage.
*   Deployment package for npm.
*   Source code repository on GitHub.

**4. Project Scope:**

**In Scope:**

*   Development of the core CLI application.
*   Integration with specified AI providers.
*   Generation of all specified PMBOK documents.
*   Implementation of the enhanced context manager.
*   PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation.
*   Comprehensive testing and documentation.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Integration with third-party project management tools (future enhancement).

*   Continuous monitoring and maintenance post-release (separate project).

**5. Project Stakeholders:**

*   **Project Manager:** [Menno Drescher or assigned PM]
*   **Development Team:** [List team members]
*   **End-Users:** Project managers, business analysts, software developers.

**6. Project Assumptions:**

*   The availability of sufficient resources (personnel, computational power).
*   The continued availability and stability of the integrated AI APIs.
*   The accuracy of the input project data provided to the tool.
*   Successful completion of all testing phases.

**7. Project Constraints:**

*   Project timeline: [Specify timeline, e.g., 6 months]
*   Budget: [Specify budget]
*   Technical limitations of the AI providers.
*   Availability of specific AI models.

**8. Project Risks:**

*   AI API limitations or unavailability.
*   Unexpected technical challenges during development.
*   Inadequate input data impacting document quality.
*   Delay in meeting deadlines due to unforeseen circumstances.
