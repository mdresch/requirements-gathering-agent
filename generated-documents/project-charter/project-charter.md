**Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent**

**1. Project Title:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**2. Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name and Contact Information]

**3. Sponsor:** [Insert Sponsor Name and Contact Information]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Insert Start Date]

**5. Planned Project Completion Date:** [Insert Completion Date]

**6. Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation from a project's README file.  The tool will leverage Azure OpenAI (with Entra ID authentication), and offer support for alternative AI providers like Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, and Ollama.

**7. Project Objectives:**

* Develop a Node.js application using TypeScript.
* Integrate with Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, and Ollama APIs.
* Generate at least 28 PMBOK-compliant project documents categorized into logical groups (Core Analysis, Project Charter, Management Plans, Planning Artifacts, Stakeholder Management, and Technical Analysis).
* Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
* Create a user-friendly command-line interface with options for selective document generation.
* Develop comprehensive documentation including installation, usage, and configuration instructions.
* Achieve a 95% accuracy rate in generating PMBOK-compliant content.
* Successfully pass all unit and integration tests.

**8. Project Deliverables:**

* Functional Requirements Gathering Agent Node.js application.
* Comprehensive documentation (README, usage instructions, API documentation).
* Unit and integration tests.
* Deployment package (e.g., npm package).
* Project closure report.


**9. High-Level Requirements:**

* The application must be able to parse a standard README.md file.
* The application must accurately generate PMBOK-compliant documents based on the README content.
* The application must provide options to select specific document types for generation.
* The application must handle API errors gracefully and implement retry logic.
* The application must be easily installable via npm.
* The application must support multiple AI providers.
* The application must provide clear and concise output organized in a structured directory.


**10. Key Stakeholders:**

* **Project Sponsor:** [Insert Name and Role] – Provides funding and high-level direction.
* **Project Manager:** [Insert Name and Role] – Manages the project execution.
* **Development Team:** [List Team Members and Roles] – Develops and tests the application.
* **End-Users:** Project Managers who need to quickly generate PMBOK documentation.


**11. Assumptions:**

* Access to Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, or Ollama APIs will be available.
* The development team possesses the necessary skills and experience.
* Adequate resources (time, budget, personnel) will be provided.
* The README files provided will contain sufficient information for accurate document generation.


**12. Constraints:**

* Project budget: [Insert Budget]
* Project timeline: [Insert Timeline]
* Required technologies: Node.js, TypeScript, Azure OpenAI API (or alternatives).


**13. Risks:**

* **API limitations:**  The AI providers may have limitations on input length or response quality.  Mitigation: Thorough testing and fallback mechanisms.
* **API outages:**  API services may experience downtime. Mitigation: Implement retry logic and alternative AI provider options.
* **Data security:**  Sensitive information may be processed by the AI models. Mitigation: Adhere to security best practices and anonymize sensitive data where possible.
* **Accuracy of generated documents:** The AI may not always generate perfectly accurate or complete information. Mitigation: Implement quality control checks and manual review.


**14. Project Approvals:**
