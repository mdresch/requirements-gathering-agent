## 1. Executive Summary

**Strategic Context:** This project directly supports the organization's strategic objective of achieving next-level API management and enhanced customer centricity within the banking industry.  This initiative is critical for maintaining a competitive edge, expanding our international footprint, and ensuring full compliance with all relevant legislation.  The RGA will significantly streamline our project documentation processes, improving efficiency and reducing time-to-market for new initiatives.

**Business Justification:**  The RGA is projected to deliver a significant ROI by automating the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  This automation will free up valuable time for project managers and business analysts, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks.  The improved quality and consistency of documentation will also reduce risks associated with ambiguity and miscommunication.  Quantifiable benefits include a projected [Insert Quantifiable Benefit from Business Case, e.g., 20%] reduction in project documentation time and a [Insert Quantifiable Benefit from Business Case, e.g., 15%] decrease in project-related errors.

**Authority and Approval:** This Project Charter formally authorizes the initiation of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project and grants the designated Project Manager full authority to commit organizational resources within the approved parameters outlined in this document.

## 2. Project Objectives and Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives:

1. **Automate PMBOK Documentation:**  Develop and deploy a fully functional system capable of automatically generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.  Success will be measured by the percentage of project documentation generated automatically (target: 90%).

2. **Enhance Efficiency:**  Reduce the time and effort required for project documentation by [Insert Percentage from Business Case, e.g., 20%], as measured by comparing pre- and post-implementation documentation times for a sample of projects.

3. **Improve Data Integrity:** Ensure all generated documents are strictly in validated JSON format, adhering to PMBOK standards and supporting interoperability with other project management tools. Success will be measured by the rate of successful schema validation (target: 100%).

4. **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Integrate the system with at least three leading AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, and one other) to ensure flexibility, redundancy, and access to cutting-edge AI capabilities. Success will be measured by successful integration and testing with each provider.

5. **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:** The system and its output will adhere to all relevant industry regulations and internal compliance standards. Success will be measured by a successful compliance audit.


### Success Criteria:

* Successful completion and deployment of the RGA system.
* Achievement of the primary objectives outlined above.
* Positive feedback from key stakeholders (Development Team, Product Owner, Architecture Team, Testing Team).
* Successful completion of all testing phases, including unit, integration, and user acceptance testing.
