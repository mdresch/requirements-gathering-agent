# User Stories for Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines user stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), categorized by user type and functionality.  The stories are prioritized and include acceptance criteria where appropriate.  The project context, including the README and associated documents, informs these user stories.

**User Types:**

* **Project Manager (PM):** Responsible for overall project planning and execution.
* **Business Analyst (BA):** Responsible for gathering and analyzing business requirements.
* **Technical Lead (TL):** Responsible for technical design and implementation.
* **Administrator (Admin):** Responsible for system maintenance and user management.
* **End-User (EU):**  Any user interacting with the generated documentation.


## Epic 1: PMBOK Document Generation

**As a Project Manager,**

* **US001 (High):** I want to generate a complete PMBOK 7.0 compliant project charter automatically from my project's README and other documentation, so that I have a formally authorized project baseline quickly.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated charter includes all required PMBOK elements, accurately reflects project scope and objectives, and is formatted for easy review and approval.  The tool should flag any missing information.
* **US002 (High):** I want to generate other key PMBOK documents (e.g., Risk Register, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan) automatically, so that I can efficiently complete my project planning.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Generated documents are PMBOK compliant, consistent with the project charter, and include relevant data extracted from my provided documentation.
* **US003 (High):** I want the tool to validate generated documents against PMBOK standards, providing a quality score and recommendations for improvement, so that I can ensure compliance and high quality.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool provides a detailed report indicating compliance level, identifies missing elements, and suggests improvements.  The quality score is based on objective metrics.
* **US004 (Medium):** I want to easily customize the output format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, YAML), so that I can integrate the generated documents into my preferred tools and workflows.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool supports multiple output formats, and the generated documents are correctly formatted in the chosen format.
* **US005 (Medium):** I want the system to automatically discover and incorporate relevant information from various project documents (beyond the README), so that the generated documents are comprehensive and accurate.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system correctly identifies and processes relevant files (requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.) and incorporates the information into the generated documents.  The system should prioritize relevant files based on content and location.


## Epic 2: Technical Design Documentation Generation

**As a Technical Lead,**

* **US006 (High):** I want to generate a comprehensive suite of technical design documents (architecture design, system design, database schema, API documentation, etc.) automatically, so that I can accelerate the design phase.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Each technical document is complete, well-structured, and includes relevant technical details. The generated documents are consistent with each other and with the overall project scope.
* **US007 (Medium):** I want the tool to use specialized AI prompts for each document type, so that the generated content is accurate and relevant to the specific technical domain.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated content is technically sound and avoids generic or inaccurate information.
* **US008 (Medium):** I want the ability to generate individual technical documents or the entire suite at once via the CLI, so that I can choose the level of detail and automation needed.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The CLI commands for generating technical documents are clear, easy to use, and support both individual and batch generation.

## Epic 3: Strategic Communication Generation

**As a Business Analyst,**

* **US009 (Medium):** I want to generate executive-ready strategic documents (company values, purpose statements, mission statements) that accurately reflect the project's goals and capabilities, so that I can effectively communicate the project's value proposition to stakeholders.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Generated documents are professionally written, concise, and accurately represent the project's essence.  They are suitable for presentation to senior management.

## Epic 4: System Administration and User Experience

**As an Administrator,**

* **US010 (Medium):** I want to be able to monitor system usage and performance, so that I can identify and address any potential issues.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system provides logs and metrics on usage, performance, and error rates.

**As an End-User,**

* **US011 (High):** I want clear and concise documentation for using the tool, so that I can easily generate the documents I need.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Comprehensive documentation is available, including tutorials, examples, and troubleshooting guides.
* **US012 (Medium):** I want the generated documents to be well-organized and easy to navigate, so that I can easily find the information I need.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Documents follow a consistent structure, use clear headings and subheadings, and are formatted for readability.


## Epic 5:  System Maintenance and Enhancements

* **US013 (Medium):** As a developer, I want a modular architecture to allow for easy addition of new document types and AI providers,  so that the system can be easily extended and updated.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The system's architecture allows for the addition of new processors with minimal code changes.  Comprehensive documentation exists for extending the system.
* **US014 (Low):** As a developer, I want the tool to support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), so that users can choose the provider that best suits their needs and budget.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The tool seamlessly supports multiple AI providers with a clear configuration mechanism.

This user story document provides a starting point and will be iteratively refined throughout the project lifecycle.  Further user stories will be added as the project evolves and new requirements emerge.
