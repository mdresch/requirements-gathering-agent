# User Stories: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines user stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), focusing on its core functionality, technical design document generation, strategic document generation, and overall user experience.  Each user story follows the format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."  Acceptance criteria will be defined separately in a dedicated document.


## Epic: Core PMBOK Document Generation

This epic covers the generation of standard PMBOK project management documents.

* **US001:** As a project manager, I want to generate a complete Project Charter automatically from my project's README and other documentation so that I can quickly initiate my project with a formally approved document.
* **US002:** As a project manager, I want the system to automatically generate a Stakeholder Register from my project's README and other documentation, including identifying key stakeholders and their influence, so that I can effectively manage stakeholder engagement.
* **US003:** As a project manager, I want to generate a Scope Management Plan automatically from my project's README and other documentation, clearly defining in-scope and out-of-scope work, so that I can effectively control project scope and prevent scope creep.
* **US004:** As a project manager, I want the system to automatically generate a Risk Register from my project's README and other documentation, including potential risks, their likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies, so that I can proactively manage project risks.
* **US005:** As a project manager, I want the system to generate a comprehensive set of PMBOK-compliant planning documents (e.g., Work Breakdown Structure, Schedule Management Plan, Cost Management Plan) from my project's README and other documentation so that I have a complete, consistent, and compliant project plan.
* **US006:** As a business analyst, I want the system to automatically generate a Requirements Management Plan from my project's README and other documentation, outlining how requirements will be collected, analyzed, and managed throughout the project lifecycle, so that I can ensure requirements are clearly defined, tracked, and met.
* **US007:** As a project manager, I want the system to validate the generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing a compliance report and recommendations for improvements, so that I can ensure my project documentation is compliant and high-quality.
* **US008:** As a project manager, I want to be able to specify the output format (Markdown, JSON, YAML) for the generated documents, so that I can easily integrate the output with my preferred tools and workflows.
* **US009:** As a project manager, I want the system to provide a detailed quality assessment score for each generated document, highlighting areas for improvement, so that I can ensure the quality and completeness of my documentation.
* **US010:** As a project manager, I want the system to automatically detect and utilize all relevant project documentation (beyond the README), scoring its relevance to the project, so that the generated documents are as comprehensive and accurate as possible.


## Epic: Technical Design Document Generation

This epic covers the generation of technical design documents.

* **US011:** As a software architect, I want to generate a comprehensive system architecture document automatically from my project's technical specifications and other relevant documentation, so that I can clearly communicate the system's design to stakeholders.
* **US012:** As a software developer, I want to generate detailed system design specifications automatically from my project's technical documentation, including component interactions, data flows, and design decisions, so that I have a clear understanding of the system's implementation details.
* **US013:** As a database administrator, I want to generate a detailed database schema document automatically from my project's data model, including tables, relationships, and data types, so that I can efficiently design and implement the database.
* **US014:** As a software developer, I want to generate comprehensive API documentation automatically from my project's code and specifications, including endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling, so that developers can easily integrate with my API.
* **US015:** As a security engineer, I want to generate a detailed security design document automatically from my project's security requirements and specifications, including security protocols, access controls, and threat models, so that I can ensure the system's security.  Similar user stories apply for Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, and Error Handling documents.


## Epic: Strategic Business Document Generation

This epic covers the generation of high-level strategic documents.

* **US016:** As a project lead, I want to generate a concise and compelling purpose statement for my project automatically from the project's goals and objectives, so that I can clearly articulate the project's value proposition to stakeholders.
* **US017:** As a project lead, I want to generate a set of core company values reflecting the project's mission and principles automatically from the project's context, so that I can communicate the project's ethical and operational guidelines.
* **US018:** As a project lead, I want to generate a comprehensive mission and vision statement for the project based on the project's goals and objectives so that I have a clear articulation of the project's direction and aspirations.


## Epic: User Experience and System Management

This epic covers the user experience and system administration aspects.

* **US019:** As a user, I want a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the tool, so that I can easily generate documents with minimal effort.
* **US020:** As a user, I want clear and concise help documentation and usage examples for all CLI commands, so that I can quickly learn how to use the tool effectively.
* **US021:** As a user, I want the tool to provide informative feedback during the document generation process, including progress updates and error messages, so that I know what's happening and can troubleshoot issues easily.
* **US022:** As a user, I want the ability to select different AI providers (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) through a user-friendly interface, so that I can leverage the best model for my needs.
* **US023:** As an administrator, I want to be able to configure the tool to use specific AI models and parameters, so that I can optimize performance and cost.
* **US024:** As a user, I want a built-in version control system for generated documents, allowing me to track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage document history, so that I have full traceability and control over my project documentation.


This user story list provides a foundation.  Further refinement and prioritization will be necessary based on project scope and timelines.  Specific acceptance criteria will be defined in a separate document.
