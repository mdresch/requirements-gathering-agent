## User Stories for ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines user stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), focusing on its core functionalities and key features.  User stories are categorized by epic to improve organization and traceability.  Each story follows the format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."  Acceptance criteria, priority, and dependencies are outlined separately.


**Type:**  Application (AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator)
**Description:**  ADPA transforms project README and related documentation into a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents, including technical design documents and strategic business communications.


**I. Epic: Core Documentation Generation**

* **US001:** As a project manager, I want to generate a complete set of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documents from my project's README file so that I can quickly initiate and manage my project effectively.
* **US002:** As a business analyst, I want to generate a project charter, stakeholder register, and scope statement automatically so that I can focus on higher-level analysis and stakeholder engagement.
* **US003:** As a technical lead, I want to generate comprehensive technical design documents (architecture, system design, database schema, etc.) so that I can efficiently create and communicate technical specifications.
* **US004:** As a marketing manager, I want to generate executive-ready strategic documents (company values, purpose statements, etc.) derived from my project's technical details so that I can effectively communicate the project's value proposition.
* **US005:** As a project manager, I want to generate specific PMBOK documents individually (e.g., only the risk register) so that I can address specific project needs efficiently.
* **US006:** As a project manager, I want the tool to automatically detect and incorporate relevant information from other project documentation files (beyond the README) so that the generated documents are comprehensive and accurate.
* **US007:** As a project manager, I want the tool to provide a quality assessment and PMBOK compliance report for each generated document so that I can ensure the quality and accuracy of my documentation.
* **US008:** As a developer, I want the tool to support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) so that I can choose the best option for my project and budget.
* **US009:** As a user, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully (e.g., API failures, invalid input) and provide informative error messages so that I can troubleshoot problems effectively.
* **US010:** As a user, I want the tool to provide detailed logging information to assist in debugging and troubleshooting so that I can identify and resolve issues quickly.
* **US011:** As a user, I want the generated documents to be organized in a clear and professional directory structure so that I can easily locate and manage them.
* **US012:** As a user, I want the option to specify the output format (Markdown, JSON, YAML) of the generated documents so that I can integrate them seamlessly into my existing workflows.


**II. Epic: Advanced Features and Enhancements**

* **US013:** As a project manager, I want the tool to provide a built-in version control system for generated documents so that I can track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
* **US014:** As a user, I want the tool to provide detailed reports on context utilization and performance metrics so that I can optimize the tool's performance for my specific AI model and project context.
* **US015:** As a developer, I want a modular architecture that allows me to easily add new document types or customize existing ones so that I can expand the tool's capabilities to meet evolving needs.
* **US016:** As a user, I want an interactive CLI menu for selecting the AI provider before running ADPA so that I can easily switch between providers without modifying configuration files.
* **US017:** As a project manager, I want the tool to provide a project kickoff checklist to help with project initiation and planning.


**III. Epic:  Project Analysis and Context Management**

* **US018:** As a user, I want the tool to intelligently discover and analyze all relevant documentation in my project (beyond the README) to build a rich context for document generation so that the generated documents are more accurate and comprehensive.
* **US019:** As a user, I want the tool to provide a relevance score for each discovered file to help me understand the importance of different documents for the generated output so that I can prioritize which documents to review manually.
* **US020:** As a user, I want the tool to automatically categorize discovered files based on their content and location so that I can easily identify the most relevant documents for my project.
* **US021:** As a user, I want the tool's context manager to adapt to my AI model's capabilities to achieve maximum context utilization so that I get the best possible results.
* **US022:** As a user, I want the tool to provide a report on the context utilized for each generated document so that I can understand how much context was used and optimize the process accordingly.


**Acceptance Criteria:**  Each user story will have specific acceptance criteria defined in a separate document, following the Given-When-Then format.  These will detail the specific conditions, actions, and expected outcomes for each user story.

**Priority:** User stories are prioritized based on their importance to the core functionality and business value.  Priorities will be assigned as High, Medium, or Low.

**Dependencies:**  Dependencies between user stories will be identified to ensure a logical implementation order.  Some stories might depend on the completion of others before they can be implemented.


This user story document provides a high-level overview. A more detailed breakdown with specific acceptance criteria, priority levels, and dependencies will be created in a subsequent document.
