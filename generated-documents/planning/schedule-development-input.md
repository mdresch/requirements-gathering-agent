# Schedule Development Input  
**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Prepared for:** Project Scheduling & Implementation Team  
**Date:** July 2025

---

## 1. Document Overview

### Purpose & Scope  
This document consolidates all critical inputs required to develop an effective and realistic project schedule for the ADPA Framework. It covers activities, sequencing, dependencies, resources, constraints, risk factors, and assumptions relevant to the multi-phase ADPA initiative, with a focus on compliance-driven, AI-powered document automation and enterprise integrations (e.g., Adobe, SharePoint, Azure).

### Relationship to Other Planning Documents  
- **Project Charter:** Defines high-level goals, deliverables, and milestones.
- **WBS (Work Breakdown Structure):** Source for activity identification and decomposition.
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** Ensures schedule alignment with compliance standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th, DMBOK 2.0).
- **Risk Register:** Identifies and tracks risks impacting schedule.

### Input Consolidation Methodology  
Inputs are drawn from:
- Project documentation and roadmap
- Technical architecture and implementation guides
- Resource and dependency analysis from integration partners
- Historical data from prior phases (e.g., Adobe PDF pipeline success)
- Expert judgment from technical/product leads

## 7. Risk Factors

### Schedule Risk Sources

- **Technical:**  
  - API changes/deprecation (Adobe, Microsoft Graph)  
  - Integration complexity with multi-provider AI
- **Resource:**  
  - Key personnel turnover  
  - Competing project priorities
- **External:**  
  - Vendor outages or rate limiting  
  - Regulatory changes (e.g., data privacy updates)

### Risk Impact on Schedule

| Risk                                                  | Probability | Impact | Schedule Effect | Mitigation Strategy                     |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Adobe API quota/changes                               | Medium      | High   | +7 days         | Early engagement, buffer, fallback paths |
| Resource unavailability (key developer)               | High        | High   | +14 days        | Cross-training, backup assignments       |
| Compliance audit delay                                | Low         | Medium | +3 days         | Early prep, pre-audit reviews            |
| Vendor authentication issues (OAuth2, Azure, etc.)    | Medium      | Medium | +5 days         | Early testing, vendor support contacts   |

### Schedule Buffers
- **Activity Buffers:** Add 1–2 days to high-risk API integration tasks
- **Project Buffer:** 10% of total duration (approx. 2 weeks)
- **Management Reserve:** 1 week reserved for critical path slippage

## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

### Key Assumptions

- **Resource:** Dedicated core team available for duration; BA and QA part-time but on call for critical reviews
- **Technology:** Stable APIs/SDKs from Adobe, Microsoft, and AI providers through August 2025
- **Process:** Template-driven development will accelerate compliance documentation

### Project Constraints

- **Scope:**  
  - Must deliver Adobe Phase 2 enhancements (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop API integrations)  
  - DMBOK 2.0 features are secondary, delivered as capacity allows
- **Time:**  
  - August 29, 2025, is a hard release date due to enterprise commitments
- **Cost:**  
  - Budget must not be exceeded; any overages require executive approval
- **Quality:**  
  - Compliance and security standards are non-negotiable; no go-live without passing all compliance checks
