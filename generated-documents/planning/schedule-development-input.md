# Schedule Development Input: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Document Overview

This document consolidates schedule development inputs for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It draws information from the project README, requirements documents (including `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`), and the API testing summary (`API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`).  The schedule will support the development, testing, and deployment of the production-ready API.

## 2. Activity Information

### 2.1 Activity List Summary

**Total Activities:**  (Estimate - requires further breakdown based on WBS)  Approximately 30-40 activities.  This is a preliminary estimate and will be refined during detailed WBS creation.

**Activity Categories:** API Development, API Testing, Documentation, Deployment, Infrastructure Setup,  Template Creation,  SharePoint Integration, Azure API Center Setup.

**Activity Sources:** Project README, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, `ARCHITECTURE.MD`, `AZURE-PORTAL-API-CENTER-SETUP-GUIDE.MD`, `AZURE-PORTAL-API-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.MD`, `BABOK-ENTERPRISE-DEMONSTRATION-GUIDE.MD`, `SHAREPOINT-USAGE-GUIDE.MD`.

### 2.2 Activity Attributes (Partial - Example)

A complete list requires a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). This is a sample to illustrate the format.

| Activity ID | Activity Name                     | Type             | Complexity | Priority | Duration (Days) | Dependencies |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------|------------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| API-DEV-1   | Design API Endpoints              | Development       | High        | Critical  | 5               |               |
| API-DEV-2   | Develop Authentication Middleware | Development       | High        | High      | 3               | API-DEV-1      |
| API-DEV-3   | Implement Document Generation      | Development       | High        | Critical  | 7               | API-DEV-2      |
| TEST-1     | Unit Testing of API Endpoints      | Testing           | Medium      | High      | 2               | API-DEV-1, API-DEV-2, API-DEV-3 |
| DOC-1      | Update Project README              | Documentation     | Low         | Medium    | 1               |               |


## 3. Activity Sequencing

### 3.1 Dependency Types

* **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Predominant dependency type.  e.g., API endpoint design must finish before implementation.
* **Start-to-Start (SS):** Used for parallel activities where both must start simultaneously.  e.g., Unit and Integration testing can run concurrently after development.
* **Finish-to-Finish (FF):**  Less common, but may be used for activities that must be completed together.

### 3.2 Major Dependencies (Partial - Example)

This section needs expansion based on the complete WBS.

| Predecessor       | Successor             | Dependency Type | Lag/Lead (Days) | Rationale                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| API-DEV-1         | API-DEV-2             | FS               | 0               | Endpoint design must be complete before middleware |
| API-DEV-2, API-DEV-3 | TEST-1               | FS               | 0               | Testing depends on completed development             |


### 3.3 External Dependencies

* **Azure API Management:**  Successful setup and configuration of API Center is a critical external dependency.
* **SharePoint Online:**  Successful configuration and access for document publishing.
* **AI Provider APIs (OpenAI, Google, etc.):** Availability and performance of these APIs.

## 4. Resource Information

### 4.1 Resource Requirements Summary

| Resource Type       | Total Required | Peak Demand (Days) | Availability (%) | Constraints                                     |

## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

This section mirrors sections 6 and 7, providing a structured overview of project assumptions and constraints for clear communication.


This Schedule Development Input provides a foundation for creating a detailed project schedule.  Further refinement is needed through a detailed WBS, more precise activity duration estimates, and a comprehensive risk assessment.  Stakeholder input is crucial for finalizing the schedule.
