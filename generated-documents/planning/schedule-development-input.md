# Schedule Development Input: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

## 1. Document Overview

This document consolidates schedule development inputs for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project (Version 2.2.0).  It integrates information from the project metadata, requirements documents (`02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`), API testing results (`API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`), architecture documentation (`ARCHITECTURE.MD`), and other relevant documentation. This input will inform the creation of a detailed project schedule.

## 2. Activity Information

### 2.1 Activity List Summary

**Total Activities:**  A precise number cannot be provided without a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  However, based on the provided documentation, we can anticipate activities across the following categories:

* **Requirements Gathering & Analysis:** Refining existing requirements, addressing gaps identified in testing.
* **Development:**  Implementation of core functionalities, API enhancements, CLI improvements, SharePoint/Confluence integration enhancements.
* **Testing:** Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, performance testing, security testing (limited scope as per `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`).
* **Documentation:** Updating existing documentation, creating new documentation as needed (e.g., updated user guides).
* **Deployment:** Deployment to production environment.
* **Post-Deployment Monitoring:** Monitoring system performance and addressing any issues.


**Activity Sources:**  The primary sources for activity identification are the requirements documents, architecture documentation, and the API testing summary.  Further refinement will require a detailed WBS decomposition.


### 2.2 Activity Attributes (Partial - Requires WBS for Completion)

A complete list of activities with attributes requires a detailed WBS.  The following provides examples based on the available information:

| Activity ID | Activity Name                                    | Type             | Complexity | Priority   | Dependencies |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------|------------|---------------|
| DEV-001     | Implement Core AI Provider Integration (OpenAI) | Development      | High        | High       | REQ-001       |
| DEV-002     | Develop CLI Interface                           | Development      | Medium      | High       | DEV-001       |
| TEST-001    | Unit Testing of AI Provider Integration         | Testing          | Medium      | High       | DEV-001       |
| DOC-001     | Update User Documentation                       | Documentation    | Medium      | Medium     | DEV-002, TEST-001 |

**Note:** `REQ-001` represents a placeholder for the completion of requirements gathering and analysis.  Specific IDs and dependencies will be defined during WBS creation.


## 3. Activity Sequencing

### 3.1 Dependency Types

The primary dependency types will be Finish-to-Start (FS), reflecting the sequential nature of software development and testing. Start-to-Start (SS) dependencies may exist for parallel development tasks. Finish-to-Finish (FF) dependencies are less likely but could arise in certain integration scenarios.


### 3.2 Major Dependencies (Partial - Requires WBS for Completion)

The following are examples based on the available information:

| Predecessor | Successor           | Dependency Type | Lag/Lead | Rationale                                      |
|-------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| REQ-001     | DEV-001              | FS              | 0         | Development cannot start before requirements are finalized. |
| DEV-001     | TEST-001            | FS              | 0         | Testing cannot start before development is complete.    |
| TEST-001    | DOC-001              | FS              | 0         | Documentation update requires test results.         |



## 4. Resource Information

### 4.1 Resource Requirements Summary (Estimate)
