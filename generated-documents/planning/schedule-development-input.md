# Schedule Development Input: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA)

## 1. Document Overview

This document consolidates schedule development inputs for the Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) project, aligning with the project charter and supporting documentation.  It informs the creation of a detailed project schedule, ensuring alignment with project goals, resource availability, and identified risks.  This input feeds directly into the creation of the project schedule, which will be managed using [Specify scheduling tool/methodology, e.g., Microsoft Project, Agile methodology with Kanban board].

## 3. Activity Sequencing

### 3.1 Dependency Types

* **Finish-to-Start (FS):**  Predominantly used (e.g., System architecture design must finish before development can begin).
* **Start-to-Start (SS):** Used for parallel tasks (e.g., unit testing of different modules can happen concurrently).
* **Finish-to-Finish (FF):**  Less frequent (e.g., documentation updates must be complete before final release).

### 3.2 Major Dependencies (Partial - Example)

A complete dependency list will be created after the detailed WBS is finalized.
