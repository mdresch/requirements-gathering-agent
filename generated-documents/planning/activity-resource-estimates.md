# Activity Resource Estimates: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## Document Overview

This document provides comprehensive resource estimates for all activities involved in the development and deployment of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  The estimates cover human resources, equipment, materials, and facilities.  The estimation methodology utilizes a bottom-up approach, breaking down the project into individual tasks and estimating resource needs for each.  We utilize a combination of expert judgment, historical data (where available), and industry benchmarks to arrive at the estimates.

## Resource Optimization Opportunities

* **Shared Resources:**  The Business Analyst could potentially be utilized across multiple phases.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Careful planning of tasks can help smooth resource utilization to avoid peaks.
* **Alternative Resources:**  Consider using freelance developers or consultants for specific tasks to supplement the core team.


**Note:** This is a preliminary estimate. A more detailed WBS and risk assessment are needed for a more accurate and comprehensive resource plan.  Costs for cloud services and AI subscriptions are highly variable and will need to be determined based on actual usage.
