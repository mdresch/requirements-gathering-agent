# Activity Resource Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

## Document Overview

This document outlines the resource estimates for the Requirements Gathering Agent project (version 2.2.0).  It details the required human resources, equipment, materials, and facilities needed to complete each project activity.  Estimates are based on a combination of bottom-up (task-based) and top-down (experience-based) approaches, considering the project scope defined in the provided documentation (`02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`, `ARCHITECTURE.MD`, etc.).

## Resource Categories

### Human Resources

**Roles and Skills:**  Project Manager, Lead Software Engineer (TypeScript, Node.js), Backend Engineer (API Development), Frontend Engineer (CLI Development), QA Engineer, DevOps Engineer, AI/ML Engineer (Integration with OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), Technical Writer.

**Skill Levels:**  A mix of Junior, Mid-level, and Senior engineers is anticipated, depending on the specific tasks.

**Availability:** Primarily full-time employees, with potential for part-time or consulting resources for specialized tasks (e.g., SharePoint integration).


### Equipment and Technology

**Hardware:**  High-performance development workstations for each engineer, a dedicated server for API deployment (potentially cloud-based).

**Software:** Node.js, TypeScript, Jest, relevant AI provider SDKs (@azure-rest/ai-inference, @azure/identity, @azure/openai, @google/generative-ai, etc.),  Git, Docker, Kubernetes (for deployment),  SharePoint Online integration tools, Microsoft Graph API client library.  Licenses for all necessary software will be required.

**Infrastructure:** Cloud infrastructure (Azure or GCP) for API hosting and AI model access,  local development environments, CI/CD pipeline.


### Materials and Supplies

**Physical Materials:** Office supplies (minimal).

**Digital Assets:**  Pre-existing templates (if any),  new templates to be created (PMBOK, BABOK compliant),  test data sets.

**Consumables:** Cloud compute credits, AI API usage costs.


## Resource Estimates by Activity

The following activities are based on the provided documentation and are a high-level representation.  A more detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) would be needed for a precise estimate.

**Note:**  Effort is estimated in person-days.  The percentage allocation reflects the proportion of a person's time dedicated to the activity.  Duration reflects the time the activity takes.  Total effort is the product of quantity, percentage allocation, and duration.

**Equipment/Technology Summary:**  (A detailed breakdown would require specifying exact hardware and software with associated costs)


**Resource Optimization Opportunities:**  Resource leveling across activities can be explored to optimize utilization and avoid peaks in resource demand.  Careful planning and prioritization of activities are crucial.


**Note:** This is a preliminary resource estimate.  A more detailed WBS and risk assessment are needed to refine these estimates.  Costs associated with each resource category (salaries, software licenses, cloud services, etc.) would need to be added for a complete budget.
