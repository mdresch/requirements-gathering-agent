### Resource Optimization Opportunities

- **Shared Resources:**  
  - Backend developers and QA/testers across modules  
  - Cloud VMs and test environments reused across dev, test, and integration
- **Resource Leveling:**  
  - Overlap document generation and integration testing with core development  
  - Stagger AI provider integration after core framework stabilization
- **Alternative Resources:**  
  - Use open-source tools where feasible (e.g., replace paid tools with community editions)
  - Substitute local GPU/VMs for cloud AI services if API quotas exceeded

---

## Assumptions & Constraints (Project-wide)

- Most team members are hybrid (on-site/remote)
- All required licenses and cloud credits are budgeted
- Adobe and enterprise API credentials are provisioned promptly
- Integration environments (SharePoint, Confluence) are accessible
- Security and compliance sign-offs are not delayed
