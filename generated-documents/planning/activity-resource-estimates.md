# Activity Resource Estimates: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

## Document Overview

This document provides comprehensive resource estimates for all activities within the Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) project.  Estimates cover human resources, equipment, materials, and facilities.  The methodology utilizes a combination of bottom-up estimation (task-based) and expert judgment, leveraging the project's existing documentation and the described capabilities of the ADPA tool itself.

**Equipment/Technology Summary:**  See Equipment and Technology section above. Costs would need to be determined based on specific hardware and software choices.

**Material Summary:**  Costs would be determined based on actual cloud usage and licenses.

**Resource Optimization Opportunities:**

* **Shared Resources:** The Senior Software Engineer and AI/ML Engineer can potentially share some tasks.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Task scheduling can be optimized to avoid peak resource utilization.
* **Alternative Resources:**  Consider using contractors for specific tasks to supplement the core team.


This detailed breakdown provides a starting point for resource allocation.  Further refinement will require a more detailed WBS and task-level estimation.  The inherent capabilities of the ADPA tool itself should significantly reduce the overall effort required for documentation generation compared to traditional methods.
