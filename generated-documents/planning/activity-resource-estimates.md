# Activity Resource Estimates: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## Document Overview

This document provides comprehensive resource estimates for all activities involved in developing and deploying the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  The estimates cover human resources, equipment, materials, and facilities.  The estimation methodology uses a combination of bottom-up and top-down approaches, leveraging expert judgment and historical data where available.

## Resource Categories

### Human Resources

**Roles and Skills:**  Software Architect, Senior Backend Developer (Express.js, TypeScript), DevOps Engineer (Azure), AI/ML Engineer, QA Engineer, Technical Writer, Project Manager.

**Skill Levels:**  All roles require at least intermediate-level skills. Senior roles require advanced expertise in their respective domains.

**Availability:** Full-time employees for core team members; potential use of part-time or consulting resources for specialized tasks (e.g., technical writing).

### Equipment and Technology

**Hardware:** High-performance development machines (5), servers (2 for development and production), testing equipment (as needed).

**Software:** Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js, relevant AI provider SDKs (@azure/openai, @google/generative-ai, etc.), testing frameworks (Jest), database (PostgreSQL or similar), API documentation tools (Swagger), CI/CD tools (Azure DevOps or similar), project management software (Jira or similar).  Licenses for all necessary software.

**Infrastructure:** Azure cloud services (compute, storage, database), Docker containers, Kubernetes (optional, depending on scaling needs).

### Materials and Supplies

**Physical Materials:** Office supplies (minimal).

**Digital Assets:**  Pre-built templates (PMBOK, BABOK), existing code libraries, test data sets (Fortune 500 data analogs).

**Consumables:** Cloud compute credits, AI API usage costs.


## Resource Estimates by Activity

The following activities are high-level and will need further breakdown into smaller, more granular tasks for precise resource allocation.  This provides a starting point.

### Activity 1: API Development and Testing

**Work Package:** WBS 1.1
**Duration:** 12 weeks

**Human Resource Requirements:**

| Role                 | Skill Level | Quantity | % Allocation | Duration (weeks) | Total Effort (weeks) |
|----------------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Senior Backend Dev   | Senior      | 2         | 80%           | 12                | 19.2                  |
| AI/ML Engineer       | Senior      | 1         | 60%           | 12                | 7.2                   |
| QA Engineer          | Intermediate | 1         | 50%           | 12                | 6                     |
| DevOps Engineer      | Intermediate | 1         | 30%           | 12                | 3.6                   |


**Equipment/Technology Requirements:** Development machines (4), servers (1), relevant software licenses and subscriptions.

**Material Requirements:**  Cloud compute credits, API usage costs.

**Estimation Basis:**  Experience with similar projects, complexity of API features, and testing requirements.

**Assumptions:**  Developers are highly proficient in TypeScript and Express.js.

**Constraints:**  Availability of AI/ML engineers with expertise in chosen AI providers.


### Activity 2: Documentation and Training Material Creation

**Work Package:** WBS 1.2
**Duration:** 4 weeks

**Human Resource Requirements:**

| Role             | Skill Level | Quantity | % Allocation | Duration (weeks) | Total Effort (weeks) |
|------------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Technical Writer | Senior      | 1         | 100%          | 4                 | 4                     |


**Equipment/Technology Requirements:** Development machine (1), word processing software.

**Material Requirements:**  None.

**Estimation Basis:**  Experience with technical writing, complexity of documentation.

**Assumptions:**  Writer is familiar with BABOK and PMBOK methodologies.


### Activity 3: Deployment and Go-Live

**Work Package:** WBS 1.3
**Duration:** 2 weeks

**Human Resource Requirements:**

| Role             | Skill Level | Quantity | % Allocation | Duration (weeks) | Total Effort (weeks) |
|------------------|-------------|----------|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| DevOps Engineer   | Intermediate | 1         | 100%          | 2                 | 2                     |


**Equipment/Technology Requirements:** Servers (1), Azure infrastructure, monitoring tools.

**Material Requirements:**  Cloud compute credits.

**Estimation Basis:**  Experience with Azure deployments, complexity of infrastructure.

**Assumptions:**  DevOps engineer is proficient in Azure services.


## Resource Summary

(This section will be populated after detailed task breakdown and resource allocation for each activity.)


### Resource Optimization Opportunities

* **Shared Resources:** The QA engineer can be shared across API development and documentation review.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Adjust developer allocations based on task complexity and dependencies.
* **Alternative Resources:**  Consider using managed services for certain aspects of infrastructure management.


This is a preliminary estimate. A more detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is needed to refine these estimates and provide a more accurate cost and resource projection.  Contingency should be added to account for unforeseen issues.
