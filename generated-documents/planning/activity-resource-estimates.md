# Activity Resource Estimates: Project Backup Vermigerous

## Document Overview

This document outlines the resource estimates for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on improving the backup process through automation and secure recovery.  The estimates cover human resources, equipment, materials, and facilities needed for each activity.  The estimation methodology uses a combination of bottom-up (task-based) and top-down (experience-based) approaches.

## Resource Categories

### Human Resources

**Roles and Skills:** DevOps Engineer (Senior), System Administrator (Intermediate)
**Skill Levels:** Senior (DevOps Engineer), Intermediate (System Administrator)
**Availability:** Full-time


### Equipment and Technology

**Hardware:**  Servers (existing infrastructure assumed),  Development workstation (if new scripts are written)
**Software:**  Existing backup software (specified in project details),  Scripting language (e.g., PowerShell, Python) with necessary libraries (for automation), Encryption software (if not built into backup software), Monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor, Prometheus)
**Infrastructure:** Cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage assumed), existing network infrastructure.


### Materials and Supplies

**Digital Assets:**  Scripts for automation, documentation for the new process, security policies.
**Consumables:** Cloud storage costs (Azure Blob Storage), potential software licenses (depending on chosen tools).

## Resource Summary

### Human Resource Summary

| Role             | Total Effort | Peak Utilization | Duration Needed | Skills Required                               |
|-----------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| DevOps Engineer   | 112 hours    | 100%             | 19 days          | Scripting, Automation, Cloud technologies, Backup software |
| System Administrator | 40 hours     | 100%             | 7 days           | System administration, Azure, Disaster recovery |


### Equipment/Technology Summary

The existing infrastructure is leveraged extensively, minimizing the need for new equipment.  Costs will primarily be associated with cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage) and potential software licensing costs.  A detailed breakdown requires specifics on the chosen software and cloud storage consumption.


### Resource Optimization Opportunities

* **Resource Leveling:**  Activities can be slightly overlapped to smooth out the peak utilization of the DevOps Engineer.
* **Shared Resources:**  The System Administrator and DevOps Engineer can collaborate on certain tasks.


This estimate provides a high-level overview.  A more detailed breakdown would require a more precise definition of the existing infrastructure and the specific tools chosen for each activity.  Costs for cloud storage and potential software licenses should be estimated separately based on vendor pricing and projected usage.
