# Milestonelist

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**Project Goal:** To develop a revolutionary AI-powered system for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation, enhancing project management efficiency and compliance.  The system will support multiple AI providers and offer a user-friendly command-line interface.  Future development will focus on expanding international compliance and integration with third-party project management tools.

**Overall Project Timeline:**  *(Insert estimated project duration here, e.g., 6 months)*

**Milestones:**  The following milestones represent key stages in the project's development and delivery.  Each milestone includes a description, target completion date (estimated), and success criteria.  Dates are estimates and subject to change based on development progress and resource availability.
