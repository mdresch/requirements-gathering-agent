# Milestone List: Project Backup Vermigerous

**Project Goal:**  Automate monthly backups for Project Backup Vermigerous, ensuring secure and reliable data recovery.  Backups will be categorized by year and month.

**Project Timeline:**  (Specify timeframe - e.g., 3 months, 6 months)


| **Milestone** | **Description** | **Target Date** | **Status** | **Dependencies** | **Assigned To** | **Notes** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Weeks 1-4)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 1.1 Secure Storage Selection | Choose and configure secure, immutable storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM).  |  |  |  |  | Consider multi-region replication for disaster recovery. |
| 1.2 Encryption Implementation | Implement AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS encryption in transit. |  |  | 1.1 |  |  Document encryption keys securely. |
| 1.3 Backup Scheduling System Setup | Set up automated backup scheduling using cron jobs, Azure Automation, or PowerShell. |  |  | 1.1, 1.2 |  | Test scheduling thoroughly.  |
| **Phase 2: Backup Process Development (Weeks 5-8)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.1 Incremental/Differential Backup Implementation | Implement incremental or differential backups to optimize storage and time. |  |  | 1.3 |  |  Thoroughly test the backup strategy. |
| 2.2 Data Integrity Check Implementation | Implement SHA-256 checksum generation and validation to ensure data integrity. |  |  | 2.1 |  |  Include alerting for checksum failures. |
| 2.3 Metadata Tagging Implementation | Implement automated metadata tagging (project name, year, month, version). |  |  | 2.1, 2.2 |  |  Define a clear metadata standard. |
| **Phase 3: Testing and Monitoring (Weeks 9-12)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.1 Automated Recovery Testing | Implement automated restore tests in a sandbox environment. |  |  | 2.3 |  |  Document test procedures and results. |
| 3.2 Monitoring and Alerting Setup | Integrate with Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, or Grafana to monitor backup status and set up alerts. |  |  | 3.1 |  |  Define alert thresholds and escalation procedures. |
| **Phase 4: Deployment and Documentation (Weeks 13-16)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.1 Deployment to Production | Deploy the automated backup system to the production environment. |  |  | 3.2 |  |  Perform a final thorough test before deployment. |
| 4.2 Documentation Finalization | Finalize and publish all project documentation, including user guides and troubleshooting steps. |  |  | 4.1 |  |  Ensure documentation is clear and comprehensive. |


**Note:**  This is a sample milestone list.  You'll need to adjust the specific tasks, dates, and assignments based on your project's needs and resources.  Add more detail to the "Notes" column as needed.  The "Status" column should be updated regularly throughout the project (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).  Dependencies should clearly indicate which milestones must be completed before others can begin.
