# WBS Dictionary

## Document Overview

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed definitions for each work package within the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It serves as a critical planning document, clarifying the scope, deliverables, responsibilities, and timelines for each task.  This dictionary is directly linked to the project's WBS, ensuring a consistent understanding of the project's breakdown.  Use this document to plan, execute, and track progress against the project plan.


## Work Package Definitions

The WBS structure is implied from the project description, focusing on major phases and deliverables.  A formal, numbered WBS would need to be created separately, but the below work packages represent logical groupings based on the provided information.  The WBS code is illustrative and would be replaced with a formal WBS code in a real project.

## Work Package Cross-Reference

(This section would contain a table summarizing all work packages, a responsibility matrix showing who is responsible for each task, and a dependency network diagram illustrating the relationships between work packages.  This is omitted here due to the illustrative nature of the WBS provided).


## Dictionary Maintenance

This WBS Dictionary will be updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle. Updates will be tracked using Git version control, with a review scheduled at the end of each sprint/iteration.  Changes will be documented in the changelog.  All stakeholders will be notified of significant changes.
