# WBS Dictionary

## Document Overview

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed definitions for each work package within the "Project Backup Vermigerous" project.  It supports the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) by clarifying tasks, deliverables, responsibilities, and timelines. This document should be used by the project team for planning, execution, monitoring, and control.

## Work Package Definitions

### 1.1 - Project Setup and Configuration

**Description:**  Configure the backup system, including selecting appropriate backup storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage), setting up encryption (AES-256), defining retention policies, and establishing monitoring and alerting mechanisms (e.g., Azure Monitor).  This includes setting up necessary user accounts and permissions.

**Deliverables:**
- Configured backup storage with encryption enabled.
- Defined retention policy documented.
- Monitoring and alerting system implemented and tested.
- User accounts and permissions documented.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Backup storage successfully configured and accessible.
- Retention policy meets project requirements.
- Monitoring and alerting system generates test alerts.
- User accounts and permissions correctly configured.

**Responsible Party:** System Administrator
**Skills Required:** Azure administration, scripting (PowerShell), security best practices.
**Estimated Effort:** 24 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 2 days

**Dependencies:** None
**Constraints:** Availability of Azure resources.
**Assumptions:** Access to Azure subscription and necessary permissions.
**Risks:** Incorrect configuration leading to backup failures. Mitigation: Thorough testing and documentation.


### 1.2 - Automated Backup Script Development

**Description:** Develop and test a robust, automated backup script (e.g., using PowerShell or Python) that performs incremental or differential backups, generates checksums (SHA-256), and logs all activities.

**Deliverables:**
- Functional backup script.
- Unit tests for the script.
- Comprehensive documentation of the script.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Script successfully backs up data incrementally/differentially.
- Checksums are generated and verified.
- Script logs all operations.
- Unit tests pass with 100% coverage.

**Responsible Party:** DevOps Engineer
**Skills Required:** Scripting (PowerShell or Python), backup software knowledge.
**Estimated Effort:** 48 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 3 days

**Dependencies:** 1.1 - Project Setup and Configuration
**Constraints:**  Complexity of the backup system.
**Assumptions:** Access to backup source data.
**Risks:** Script bugs leading to data loss. Mitigation: Thorough testing and review.


### 1.3 - Backup Scheduling and Automation

**Description:** Implement a reliable scheduling mechanism (e.g., Azure Automation, cron jobs) to trigger the backup script monthly according to a predefined schedule.

**Deliverables:**
- Scheduled backup job.
- Documentation of the scheduling mechanism.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Backup job runs automatically monthly as scheduled.
- Logs confirm successful execution.

**Responsible Party:** DevOps Engineer
**Skills Required:** Scheduling mechanisms (Azure Automation, cron), scripting.
**Estimated Effort:** 8 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 1 day

**Dependencies:** 1.2 - Automated Backup Script Development
**Constraints:** System uptime requirements.
**Assumptions:** Stable backup script.
**Risks:** Scheduling conflicts. Mitigation: Careful scheduling and testing.


### 1.4 - Backup Validation and Integrity Checks

**Description:** Implement automated validation procedures to verify data integrity after each backup. This includes comparing checksums and performing basic data checks to ensure the backups are complete and free from corruption.

**Deliverables:**
- Automated validation script.
- Documentation of validation procedures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Validation script runs automatically after each backup.
- Validation script reports any inconsistencies.

**Responsible Party:** DevOps Engineer
**Skills Required:** Scripting, data integrity verification techniques.
**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 2 days

**Dependencies:** 1.2 - Automated Backup Script Development
**Constraints:** Performance impact of validation.
**Assumptions:** Stable backup script.
**Risks:** False positives from validation. Mitigation: Thorough testing and refinement.


### 1.5 - Automated Recovery Testing

**Description:** Set up and execute automated recovery tests in a sandbox environment to verify the recoverability of the backups.  This involves periodically restoring the backups and verifying data integrity.

**Deliverables:**
- Automated recovery test script.
- Test results and reports.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Recovery test script successfully restores data.
- Data integrity is verified after restoration.
- Test reports are generated.

**Responsible Party:** System Administrator
**Skills Required:** Restoration procedures, data verification.
**Estimated Effort:** 24 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 2 days

**Dependencies:** 1.1 - Project Setup and Configuration, 1.2 - Automated Backup Script Development
**Constraints:** Availability of sandbox environment.
**Assumptions:** Access to sandbox environment.
**Risks:** Recovery failures. Mitigation: Address issues identified during testing.


### 1.6 - Documentation and Training

**Description:** Create comprehensive documentation for the backup system, including setup instructions, troubleshooting guides, and user training materials.

**Deliverables:**
- User manual.
- Administrator guide.
- Training materials.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documentation is clear, concise, and complete.
- Training materials are effective.

**Responsible Party:** Documentation Specialist
**Skills Required:** Technical writing, training delivery.
**Estimated Effort:** 16 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 2 days

**Dependencies:** All previous work packages.
**Constraints:** Time available for documentation.
**Assumptions:** Access to all project information.
**Risks:** Incomplete or inaccurate documentation. Mitigation: Peer review and testing.
