# WBS Dictionary

## Document Overview

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed definitions for each work package identified in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It serves as a critical planning document, clarifying the scope, deliverables, responsibilities, and dependencies of each work package to facilitate accurate project scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management.  This document is directly linked to the project's WBS, providing a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to achieve the project's objectives.  Each work package definition includes specific deliverables, acceptance criteria, responsible parties, effort estimations, and potential risks.  This dictionary should be used by the project team throughout the project lifecycle for planning, tracking, and reporting purposes.


## Work Package Definitions

The following work packages are based on a high-level decomposition of the project, focusing on key functional areas. A more granular WBS might be necessary as the project progresses.

**Note:** Effort and duration estimations are preliminary and subject to change based on further analysis and refinement.  All durations are in days.

## Work Package Cross-Reference

(This section would contain a table summarizing all work packages, including dependencies, responsible parties, and durations.  A Gantt chart or other visual representation of the project schedule would also be beneficial here.)


## Dictionary Maintenance

This WBS Dictionary will be updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in scope, deliverables, or responsibilities.  Changes will be tracked using version control (e.g., Git), and a review schedule will be established to ensure accuracy and consistency.  The Project Manager is responsible for maintaining this document.
