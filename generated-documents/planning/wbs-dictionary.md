# WBS Dictionary

## Document Overview

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed definitions for each work package within the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  It supports the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) by clarifying tasks, deliverables, responsibilities, and constraints. This document aids in planning, execution, monitoring, and control of the project.

**Relationship to Work Breakdown Structure:** This dictionary directly supports the WBS by providing granular detail for each WBS element, ensuring a clear understanding of the work involved.

**How to Use This Document:** This document serves as a reference for all project stakeholders.  Project managers will use it for planning and tracking progress. Team members will use it to understand their individual responsibilities.  It should be consulted regularly throughout the project lifecycle.


## Work Package Definitions

The following WBS structure is assumed, based on the provided documentation. A more detailed WBS may be necessary after further requirements clarification.  This dictionary focuses on high-level work packages.

## Work Package Cross-Reference, Responsibility Matrix, and Dependency Network Overview

*(This section would contain a table summarizing all work packages, a responsibility assignment matrix showing who is responsible for each work package, and a visual representation of the dependencies between work packages.  Due to the limitations of this text-based format, these tables cannot be effectively generated here.  They would be included in a proper WBS Dictionary document.)*


## Dictionary Maintenance

This WBS Dictionary will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle.  Updates will be made as needed to reflect changes in requirements, scope, or schedule.  Version control will be implemented using [specify version control system, e.g., Git].  A review schedule will be established to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information.
