# WBS Dictionary

## Document Overview

**Purpose and Scope:**  
This WBS Dictionary provides comprehensive definitions for each work package in the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project. It clarifies the scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria, responsibilities, required competencies, estimates, dependencies, constraints, assumptions, and risks for every major component and subcomponent of the project.

**Relationship to Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  
The WBS decomposes the ADPA project into manageable sections. This dictionary acts as the authoritative reference for all work packages, ensuring clarity in execution, accountability, and effective communication among project stakeholders.

**How to Use This Document:**  
Project managers, team leads, developers, QA, and stakeholders should use this document to:
- Understand detailed work package requirements and expectations
- Assign and manage responsibilities
- Plan, estimate, and monitor progress
- Assess risks, dependencies, and constraints
