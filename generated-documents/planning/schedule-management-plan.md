# Schedule Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Owner:** [Requirements Gathering Agent / ADPA Team](https://github.com/mdresch/requirements-gathering-agent)  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Document Status:** Approved

---

## 1. Purpose

This Schedule Management Plan defines the approach, tools, responsibilities, and procedures used to develop, monitor, control, and communicate the project schedule for the ADPA Enterprise Framework. It ensures timely delivery of all project components, including AI-powered document automation, multi-framework integration, and enterprise-grade features. The plan aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition best practices and leverages the modular, standards-compliant architecture unique to ADPA.

---

## 2. Schedule Management Approach

### 2.1 Methodology

- **Hybrid Agile/Waterfall**: Iterative delivery for core automation components and integrations (Agile), milestone-driven for compliance and major architectural features (Waterfall).
- **Industry Standards**: Schedule management fully aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition, including phased milestones, baseline tracking, and ongoing performance measurement.

### 2.2 Tools and Systems

- **Project Management**: Jira Cloud (primary), Azure DevOps (optional for enterprise clients)
- **Collaboration**: Confluence and SharePoint for schedule visibility and documentation
- **Automation**: ADPA CLI/API for milestone reporting and documentation generation
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source, milestone, and release tracking
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions, Azure Pipelines

## 3. Schedule Development

### 3.1 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The WBS is maintained in the project’s Confluence space and versioned in the `docs/` directory. Key elements:

- **Framework Core**
  - AI Processing Engine
  - Document Generator
  - REST API Server
  - CLI Interface
  - Admin Web Portal

- **Integrations**
  - Confluence
  - SharePoint
  - Adobe Document Services

- **Compliance & Security**
  - Authentication/Authorization
  - Regulatory Frameworks (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.)

- **Standards Support**
  - BABOK v3 (complete)
  - PMBOK 7th Edition (complete)
  - DMBOK 2.0 (in progress)

### 3.2 Activity Definition & Sequencing

- **Tasks** are defined in Jira and mapped to WBS elements.
- **Dependencies** (FS, SS, FF, SF) are tracked in Jira, with summary Gantt charts maintained in Confluence.
- **Critical Path** is identified for each major release (e.g., DMBOK 2.0 support and advanced analytics).

### 3.3 Duration Estimation

- **Expert Judgment**: Draws on historicals from ADPA v2.x and similar enterprise automation projects.
- **Parametric Estimation**: Used for repeatable activities (e.g., API integration, standards mapping).

---

## 4. Schedule Baseline and Control

### 4.1 Baseline Definition

- **Initial Baseline**: Defined at project kickoff and documented in Confluence.
- **Change Control**: All changes to the baseline require approval by the Project Manager and are logged in Jira and Confluence.

### 4.2 Monitoring and Controlling

- **Progress Tracking**: Weekly status updates via Jira and auto-generated reports from the ADPA analytics module.
- **Variance Analysis**: Actual vs. planned tracked for each milestone.
- **Forecasting**: Rolling-wave forecasting enabled by CI/CD metrics and AI analytics.

### 4.3 Schedule Compression Techniques

- **Fast-Tracking**: Parallel development of CLI/API features and integration modules where feasible.
- **Crashing**: Additional resources allocated to critical path items when needed.

- **Lessons Learned**: Incorporated into future estimation and planning cycles.
- **Tooling Improvements**: Continuous updates to ADPA’s own schedule/reporting automation features.

---

## 11. Unique Project Considerations

- **Multi-Framework Standards Compliance**: Synchronizing BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK deliverables requires careful milestone orchestration.
- **AI-Powered Estimation**: Leverages ADPA’s analytics to refine scheduling and forecasting.
- **Enterprise Integration Complexity**: SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe, and SSO dependencies must be reflected in schedule buffers.
- **Open Source Community Contributions**: Release planning accounts for external input and PR review cycles.
