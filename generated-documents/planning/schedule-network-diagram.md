# Schedulenetworkdiagram for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the schedule and network diagram for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Due to the dynamic nature of AI-driven development and the project's focus on rapid prototyping and iterative development, a traditional Gantt chart might not fully represent the project's workflow.  Instead, this document will focus on key milestones, dependencies, and potential critical paths.  The project utilizes an Agile methodology with short sprint cycles.

**Phase 1:  Foundation (Weeks 1-4)**

* **Milestone 1 (Week 1):** Project Kickoff and Environment Setup.  This includes setting up the development environment, establishing version control (Git), and defining initial project architecture.
* **Milestone 2 (Week 2):** Core API Development (Authentication, Routing).  Focus on building the foundational API structure, including authentication mechanisms and API routing.  This is a critical path item.
* **Milestone 3 (Week 3):** Initial AI Provider Integration (OpenAI).  Integrate with the primary AI provider (OpenAI) and test basic functionality. This is dependent on Milestone 2.
* **Milestone 4 (Week 4):** Basic Document Generation Functionality. Implement basic document generation capabilities using a simple template. This is dependent on Milestone 3.

**Phase 2: Feature Development (Weeks 5-8)**

* **Milestone 5 (Week 5):**  Advanced Template Engine.  Develop a robust template engine to support complex document structures and formatting.  This is a critical path item.
* **Milestone 6 (Week 6):**  Additional AI Provider Integration (Google AI, optional). Integrate with additional AI providers based on performance and cost considerations.  This is dependent on Milestone 5.
* **Milestone 7 (Week 7):**  SharePoint and Confluence Integration. Implement integration with SharePoint and Confluence for document publishing and collaboration. This is dependent on Milestone 5.
* **Milestone 8 (Week 8):**  Comprehensive Error Handling and Logging.  Implement robust error handling and detailed logging for debugging and monitoring. This is a critical path item.

**Phase 3: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 9-12)**

* **Milestone 9 (Week 9):**  Unit and Integration Testing.  Conduct thorough unit and integration testing of all API endpoints and functionality.  This is dependent on Milestones 5 and 8.
* **Milestone 10 (Week 10):**  User Acceptance Testing (UAT).  Perform UAT with stakeholders to validate functionality and usability. This is dependent on Milestone 9.
* **Milestone 11 (Week 11):**  Performance and Security Testing.  Conduct performance and security testing to ensure scalability and resilience. This is dependent on Milestone 9.
* **Milestone 12 (Week 12):**  Production Deployment. Deploy the application to a production environment. This is dependent on Milestones 9, 10, and 11.

**Network Diagram (Simplified):**

This diagram simplifies dependencies.  Actual dependencies are more complex and managed within the project management system.

```
[Milestone 1] --> [Milestone 2] --> [Milestone 3] --> [Milestone 4]
                                                ^
                                                |
                                        [Milestone 5] --> [Milestone 6] --> [Milestone 7] --> [Milestone 8] --> [Milestone 9] --> [Milestone 10] --> [Milestone 11] --> [Milestone 12]
```

**Critical Path:** Milestones 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 represent the critical path. Delays in these milestones will directly impact the overall project timeline.

**Contingency Planning:**

* **AI Provider Downtime:**  Implement fallback mechanisms and alternative AI providers to mitigate downtime.
* **Unexpected Bugs:** Allocate time for bug fixing and code refactoring.
* **Integration Challenges:**  Include buffer time for resolving integration issues with SharePoint and Confluence.


**Note:** This schedule and network diagram are high-level representations.  Detailed task breakdowns and timelines are managed within the project's Agile framework using a sprint-based approach.  Regular sprint reviews and retrospectives will refine the schedule and address any emerging challenges.
