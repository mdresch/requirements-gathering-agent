# Schedule Network Diagram

This document outlines the schedule network diagram for the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project.  Due to the iterative and evolving nature of the ADPA project, and the lack of specific task durations and dependencies in the provided project README, this diagram represents a *high-level* overview of key phases and their relationships. A more detailed Gantt chart with specific task durations would require additional project planning information.

This diagram uses a simplified representation, focusing on major milestones and dependencies.  It does not represent a fully detailed critical path analysis.

**Key Milestones & Phases:**

* **Phase 1: Core Development (Foundation)**: This phase focuses on building the core functionality of the ADPA, including the PMBOK document generation engine, the enhanced context manager, and basic CLI integration.  This phase includes the initial development of the Technical Design Document System.

* **Phase 2: Enhanced Context & Analysis:** This phase builds upon the core functionality by implementing the advanced context analysis system, intelligent source discovery, and the multi-provider support.

* **Phase 3: Strategic & Technical Document Generation:**  This is where the AI-powered generation of strategic documents (like purpose statements and company values), along with the full suite of technical design documents are added.  This phase also includes extensive testing and validation.

* **Phase 4: Validation & Refinement:** This phase is dedicated to thorough testing, PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation, and refinement of the generated documents based on feedback and testing results.  The version control system is fully integrated during this phase.

* **Phase 5: Release & Deployment:** This phase includes the final release of the tool to NPM, documentation updates, and preparation for public availability.


**Simplified Network Diagram (Illustrative):**

This diagram is best represented visually.  Since I cannot create visual diagrams, I will describe a representation using text.  Consider using project management software (like Microsoft Project, Smartsheet, or Jira) to create a proper visual diagram based on this description.

```
                                     Phase 1: Core Development
                                            |
                                            V
                                     Phase 2: Enhanced Context & Analysis
                                            |
                                            V
                      -------------------------------------------------
                      |                                               |
                      V                                               V
          Phase 3: Strategic & Technical Document Generation     Phase 4: Validation & Refinement
                      |                                               |
                      V                                               V
                                     Phase 5: Release & Deployment

```

**Dependencies:**

* Phase 2 is dependent on the completion of Phase 1.  The enhanced context and analysis features cannot be implemented until the core document generation engine is functional.

* Phase 3 is dependent on Phase 2. The strategic and technical document generation relies on the enhanced context and analysis capabilities.

* Phase 4 is dependent on Phase 3.  Validation and refinement cannot occur until the documents are generated.

* Phase 5 is dependent on Phase 4.  The release and deployment cannot happen until the system is validated and refined.


**Note:**  This is a simplified representation.  A complete schedule network diagram would include individual tasks within each phase, specific durations, dependencies between individual tasks, and critical path analysis.  The provided README does not contain this level of detail.  This high-level representation should be considered a starting point for more detailed project planning.
