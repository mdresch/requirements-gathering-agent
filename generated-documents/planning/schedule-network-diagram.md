# Schedule Network Diagram

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This schedule network diagram represents a high-level overview of the ADPA project's key activities and their dependencies.  Due to the iterative and AI-driven nature of the project, precise durations are difficult to estimate.  This diagram focuses on major milestones and dependencies rather than granular task scheduling.

**Note:**  This diagram is a simplified representation and does not include all tasks.  A more detailed Gantt chart or project management software would be necessary for comprehensive task scheduling.

**Activity Descriptions:**

* **A: Project Inception & Authorization:** Defining the project's goals, scope, and obtaining executive approval.  This includes creating the initial project charter and business case.

* **B: Context Foundation Strategy:** Developing the core AI-powered strategic foundation. This involves stakeholder analysis, risk assessment, and defining precise project boundaries.

* **C: Technical Design Document System:** Developing the AI-powered system for generating technical design documents (10 document types). This includes designing the modular architecture, AI prompts, and professional templates.

* **D: Business Communication Translator System:** Developing the AI system for translating technical project context into strategic business communications (company values, purpose statements, etc.).

* **E: System Testing & QA:** Comprehensive testing of both the technical design document system and the business communication translator system, ensuring quality and PMBOK compliance.

* **F: Version 2.1.3 Release:**  Release of the fully functional version 2.1.3 to npm, including all features.

* **G: Ongoing Development & Maintenance:** Continuous improvement, bug fixes, and feature enhancements based on user feedback and emerging requirements.

* **H: Future Enhancements (Parallelization, etc.):** Planned future development, including implementing asynchronous parallelization for faster processing, and advanced context management features.


**Dependencies:**

The diagram clearly shows the dependencies between the activities.  For example, the Context Foundation Strategy (B) must be completed before both the Technical Design Document System (C) and the Business Communication Translator System (D) can be fully developed.  Both systems (C and D) must be tested (E) before the release (F).


**Milestones:**

Key milestones are highlighted in the diagram (A and F) to indicate significant progress points in the project.


This Schedule Network Diagram provides a visual representation of the project's timeline and dependencies, allowing for better understanding and management of the development process.  Remember that this is a high-level overview; a more detailed schedule would be necessary for actual project execution.
