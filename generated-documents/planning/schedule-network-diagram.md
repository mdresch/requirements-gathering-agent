# Schedule Network Diagram

This document outlines the schedule network diagram for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Due to the iterative and evolving nature of the ADPA project, as evidenced by the provided README, a precisely detailed Gantt chart or network diagram cannot be generated without more specific task durations and dependencies. However, this document will provide a high-level representation of the key phases and dependencies.

**Note:**  This diagram represents a simplified overview.  A more detailed diagram would require a formal project plan with defined tasks, durations, and dependencies.

**Key Phases:**

1. **Project Inception & Strategic Planning:** This phase involved the initial concept, business case development, stakeholder analysis, and securing executive authorization.  This phase was completed successfully, as documented in the README.

2. **Core Functionality Development:** This phase focused on the initial implementation of the core PMBOK document generation capabilities.  This included the development of the context management system, AI provider integration, document generation engine, and the command-line interface.  This phase involved several iterations and improvements based on testing and feedback.

3. **Technical Design Document System Development:**  This phase involved the creation of a comprehensive suite of technical document processors and templates, significantly expanding ADPA's capabilities.  This involved developing specialized AI prompts and integrating these new processors into the existing system.

4. **Business Communication Translator System Development:** This phase focused on enhancing ADPA's ability to generate strategic business communications from the technical project context.  This involved developing new AI prompts, templates, and a robust context understanding system.

5. **Version Control System Integration:** This phase involved integrating a version control system (VCS) for managing and tracking changes to generated documents. This included development of CLI commands and configuration options.

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**  Ongoing throughout all phases, rigorous testing and quality assurance processes were implemented to ensure PMBOK compliance, document accuracy, and system reliability.

7. **Deployment and Maintenance:**  The final phase involves the deployment of the final product to NPM and ongoing maintenance, updates, and support.  This is an ongoing process.



**High-Level Dependency Representation:**

The following simplified representation illustrates the dependencies between the major phases:


```
[Project Inception & Strategic Planning] --> [Core Functionality Development] --> [Technical Design Document System Development] --> [Business Communication Translator System Development] --> [Version Control System Integration] --> [Testing and Quality Assurance] --> [Deployment and Maintenance]
                                                                                                                               ^
                                                                                                                               |
                                                                                                                               +---[Testing and Quality Assurance] (Iterative throughout all phases)


```

**Diagrammatic Representation (Conceptual):**

A visual network diagram would ideally be presented here.  However, without precise task durations and dependencies, a meaningful diagram cannot be accurately generated.  A visual representation would show nodes (phases) connected by arrows (dependencies), potentially using a critical path method to highlight the most time-sensitive sequences.  Tools like Microsoft Project, Jira, or even simple diagramming software could be used to create this visual representation once the project plan is fully defined.


**Next Steps:**

To create a more comprehensive and accurate Schedule Network Diagram, the following information is required:

* **Detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A complete breakdown of all tasks within each phase.
* **Task Durations:** Estimated time required for each task.
* **Task Dependencies:** Identification of dependencies between tasks.
* **Resource Allocation:** Assignment of resources (personnel, tools) to each task.


Once this information is available, a precise and informative schedule network diagram can be generated and included in the project plan.
