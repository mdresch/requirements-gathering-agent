## Schedulenetworkdiagram for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines a schedule network diagram for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, focusing on key milestones and dependencies.  Due to the dynamic nature of AI-driven development and the limited information provided regarding specific task durations, this diagram represents a high-level overview.  A more granular diagram would require detailed task breakdowns and time estimations from the development team.


**Diagram Type:** Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) - This method clearly shows task dependencies.

**Software Used:**  While any project management software can be used, tools like Microsoft Project, Smartsheet, or even a simple Gantt chart tool would be suitable.


**High-Level Milestones and Dependencies:**

The diagram would visually represent the following phases and their dependencies.  Note that durations are placeholders and should be replaced with actual estimates.

**Phase 1:  Foundation & Setup (Estimated Duration: 2 Weeks)**

* **Task 1:** Project Initialization & Planning (1 day) –  Starts the project.
* **Task 2:**  Environment Setup (3 days) – Setting up development environments, installing dependencies.  Dependent on Task 1.
* **Task 3:** API Framework Design (5 days) – Designing the Express.js API structure using TypeSpec. Dependent on Task 2.
* **Task 4:** Database Design (3 days) – Designing the database schema (if applicable).  Can run concurrently with Task 3.
* **Task 5:** Initial Unit Testing Framework Setup (2 days) – Setting up Jest testing environment.  Dependent on Task 3.


**Phase 2: API Development & Testing (Estimated Duration: 4 Weeks)**

* **Task 6:** API Endpoint Development (10 days) – Developing the core API endpoints. Dependent on Task 3.
* **Task 7:**  Unit Testing of API Endpoints (10 days) – Thorough testing of individual API endpoints. Dependent on Task 6.
* **Task 8:**  Integration Testing (5 days) – Testing the interaction between different API components. Dependent on Task 7.
* **Task 9:** API Security Implementation (5 days) – Implementing authentication, rate limiting, and input validation. Dependent on Task 3.
* **Task 10:** API Documentation Generation (3 days) – Generating OpenAPI specifications. Dependent on Task 6.


**Phase 3:  AI Integration & Model Training (Estimated Duration: 3 Weeks)**

* **Task 11:** AI Provider Integration (7 days) – Integrating with OpenAI, Google AI, etc. Dependent on Task 3.
* **Task 12:**  Model Training and Fine-tuning (10 days) – Training and optimizing AI models for document generation. Dependent on Task 11.
* **Task 13:**  AI Integration Testing (6 days) – Testing the AI integration and document generation. Dependent on Task 12.


**Phase 4:  Deployment & Final Testing (Estimated Duration: 1 Week)**

* **Task 14:**  Deployment to Staging Environment (2 days) – Deploying the API to a staging environment for final testing. Dependent on Task 13.
* **Task 15:**  End-to-End Testing (3 days) – Comprehensive testing of the entire system in the staging environment. Dependent on Task 14.
* **Task 16:** Deployment to Production (2 days) – Deploying the API to the production environment. Dependent on Task 15.


**Phase 5: Post-Launch & Maintenance (Ongoing)**

* **Task 17:** Monitoring and Maintenance (Ongoing) – Monitoring API performance and addressing any issues. Dependent on Task 16.
* **Task 18:** Documentation Updates (Ongoing) – Updating documentation as needed. Dependent on Task 16.


**Visual Representation:**

The diagram would use nodes to represent tasks and arrows to indicate dependencies.  Critical paths (sequences of tasks that determine the overall project duration) would be highlighted.  Milestones (major completion points) would be clearly marked.


**Note:** This is a simplified representation. A complete schedule network diagram would include more detailed tasks, dependencies, and durations, providing a more accurate project timeline and risk assessment.  This high-level overview serves as a starting point for a more comprehensive plan.
