# Schedule Network Diagram for Requirements Gathering Agent (v2.2.0)

This document outlines a proposed schedule network diagram for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project (v2.2.0).  Due to the lack of specific task durations and dependencies within the provided project context, this diagram represents a high-level overview.  A more detailed diagram would require additional project planning information, including task breakdown, estimated durations, and dependencies.

**Project Goal:** Develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered system for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.

**Key Deliverables:**

* Functional RGA System
* Comprehensive User Documentation
* Integration with Multiple AI Providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
* Secure API (Authentication & Authorization)
* CLI for User Interaction
* SharePoint & Confluence Integration (optional)


**High-Level Schedule Network Diagram (Illustrative):**

This diagram uses a simplified representation.  Actual durations and dependencies would need to be defined in a detailed project plan.

**Legend:**

* **Rectangles:** Represent tasks or activities.
* **Arrows:** Indicate dependencies between tasks.  The arrow points from a predecessor task to a successor task.


**Note:**  This is a simplified representation.  A complete schedule network diagram would include:

* **Task IDs:** Unique identifiers for each task.
* **Task Durations:** Estimated time to complete each task (in days, weeks, etc.).
* **Dependencies:** Clearly defined predecessor and successor relationships between tasks.
* **Critical Path:** The longest sequence of tasks determining the shortest possible project duration.
* **Milestones:** Significant points in the project timeline.
* **Resources:** Assignment of personnel or other resources to tasks.
* **Contingency Time:** Buffer time to account for unforeseen delays.


**Next Steps:**

1. **Detailed Task Breakdown:**  Decompose the high-level tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
2. **Duration Estimation:**  Estimate the duration of each sub-task based on complexity and resource availability.
3. **Dependency Identification:**  Identify the dependencies between all sub-tasks.
4. **Critical Path Analysis:**  Determine the critical path to identify potential bottlenecks.
5. **Resource Allocation:**  Assign resources to tasks.
6. **Risk Assessment:**  Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
7. **Schedule Refinement:**  Iteratively refine the schedule based on feedback and risk assessment.
8. **Create a Detailed Schedule Network Diagram:** Using project management software (e.g., MS Project, Jira) to create a detailed and visually clear schedule network diagram.


This high-level overview provides a starting point for creating a comprehensive schedule network diagram for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The next steps outlined above are crucial for accurate project planning and successful execution.
