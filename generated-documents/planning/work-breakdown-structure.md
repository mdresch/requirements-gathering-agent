# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) outlines the work required for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  The WBS uses a hierarchical decomposition approach, breaking down the project into manageable work packages.  The approach prioritizes a balance between detail and manageability, focusing on key deliverables and phases.

## WBS Hierarchy

## Work Package Descriptions

A detailed description for each work package would be included in a separate document, the WBS Dictionary.  This would include:

* **WBS Code:** (e.g., 1.1.1)
* **Work Package Name:** (e.g., Project Charter Development)
* **Description:** (Detailed description of the work involved)
* **Deliverables:** (Specific outputs expected)
* **Acceptance Criteria:** (How to determine if the work is complete and meets requirements)
* **Assigned Resources:** (Individuals or teams responsible)
* **Estimated Duration:** (Time allocated for completion)


## WBS Guidelines

* **Decomposition Principles:**  The WBS uses a hierarchical decomposition, breaking down the project into progressively smaller, more manageable work packages.  Decomposition is based on functionality, deliverables, and phases.
* **Level of Detail Rationale:** The level of detail is chosen to balance manageability with sufficient clarity. Further decomposition into activities could be added if needed for detailed scheduling and tracking.
* **Maintenance Procedures:** The WBS will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in scope, schedule, or resources.  Changes will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.


This WBS provides a comprehensive framework for managing the ADPA project.  The detailed work package descriptions and dictionary would complete the WBS, ensuring complete scope coverage and facilitating effective project execution.
