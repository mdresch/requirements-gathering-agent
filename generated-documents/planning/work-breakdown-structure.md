# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This project, "Project Backup Vermigerous," aims to automate the monthly backup process, ensuring sufficient backups for system restoration after failures.  The backups are categorized by year and month. The WBS will follow a decomposition approach focusing on the key phases of design, development, testing, and deployment.

## WBS Hierarchy

**1.0 Project Backup Vermigerous**

**1.1 Design Phase**

* **1.1.1 Requirements Gathering:** Define detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the automated backup system.  This includes specifying backup frequency, types of backups (full, incremental, differential), storage location, security requirements (encryption, access control), validation mechanisms, and recovery testing procedures.
* **1.1.2 System Architecture Design:** Design the overall architecture of the backup system, including the selection of appropriate technologies (e.g., scripting language, storage solution, monitoring tools), interfaces, and data flow.  This also involves defining the backup schedule, metadata schema, and alert thresholds.
* **1.1.3 Database Design (if applicable):**  Design the database schema (if a database is used to store metadata). This includes defining tables, fields, data types, relationships, and indexes.
* **1.1.4 Security Design:** Design security measures to protect backups at rest and in transit, including encryption algorithms, access control lists, and multi-factor authentication.  This includes defining the immutable storage strategy.

**1.2 Development Phase**

* **1.2.1 Script Development (or Application Development):** Develop the automated backup script(s) or application based on the design specifications. This includes implementing backup scheduling, backup types, data validation, metadata tagging, and secure storage.
* **1.2.2 Secure Storage Implementation:** Set up the chosen secure storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy). Configure encryption at rest and in transit. Implement multi-region replication if required.
* **1.2.3 Metadata Management Implementation:** Implement metadata tagging and storage mechanisms according to the design specifications. This may involve creating a database or using a file-based system.
* **1.2.4 Monitoring & Alerting Implementation:** Integrate the backup system with monitoring and alerting tools (e.g., Azure Monitor) and configure alerts for failures, delays, or storage thresholds.

**1.3 Testing Phase**

* **1.3.1 Unit Testing:** Test individual components of the backup system (e.g., backup script functions, security modules, metadata management routines).
* **1.3.2 Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different components of the backup system.
* **1.3.3 System Testing:** Test the entire backup system to ensure it meets all requirements. This includes verifying backup functionality, data integrity, recovery procedures, monitoring, and alerting.
* **1.3.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Allow end-users to test the system and provide feedback.

**1.4 Deployment Phase**

* **1.4.1 Deployment Environment Setup:** Prepare the production environment for the backup system deployment.
* **1.4.2 System Deployment:** Deploy the backup system to the production environment.
* **1.4.3 Post-Deployment Verification:** Verify the system is functioning correctly in the production environment.
* **1.4.4 Documentation Update:** Update all relevant documentation to reflect the deployed system.


**1.5 Project Management**

* **1.5.1 Planning & Scheduling:** Create a project plan, including timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.
* **1.5.2 Risk Management:** Identify and mitigate potential risks.
* **1.5.3 Communication & Reporting:** Maintain regular communication with stakeholders and provide progress reports.
* **1.5.4 Issue Tracking & Resolution:** Track and resolve any issues that arise during the project.


## Work Package Descriptions

A detailed description of each work package will be included in the project plan, specifying deliverables, acceptance criteria, and assigned resources.  This will be a separate document linked to this WBS.

## WBS Guidelines

This WBS uses a hierarchical decomposition approach, breaking down the project into manageable work packages.  The level of detail is sufficient to provide a clear understanding of the project scope and allow for effective planning and tracking.  The WBS will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, with updates reflecting any changes in scope or requirements.


This WBS provides a comprehensive framework for managing the Project Backup Vermigerous project.  The detailed work package descriptions and project plan will provide further clarity and support efficient execution.
