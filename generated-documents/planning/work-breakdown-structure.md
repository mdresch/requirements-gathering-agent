# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This document outlines the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the "Self-Charging Electric Vehicle" (SCEV) project.  The WBS uses a hierarchical decomposition approach, breaking down the project into progressively smaller, more manageable work packages.  The decomposition is guided by the project milestones and core technologies outlined in the project context.  The goal is to ensure complete scope coverage and facilitate effective project planning, execution, and monitoring.

## WBS Hierarchy

## Work Package Descriptions

This section would contain a detailed description for each work package identified above (1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, etc.), including WBS code, work package name, description, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  Due to the length, this is omitted here but would be crucial for a complete WBS document.


## WBS Guidelines

*   **Decomposition Principles:** The WBS uses a functional decomposition approach, breaking down the project based on the functions and subsystems required to achieve the project goals.
*   **Level of Detail:** The WBS is detailed enough to provide a clear understanding of the work required but avoids excessive detail that could hinder flexibility and adaptability.
*   **Maintenance Procedures:** The WBS will be regularly reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in project scope, requirements, or priorities.  Changes will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.


This WBS provides a robust framework for managing the SCEV project.  The detailed work package descriptions (omitted for brevity) would further enhance its utility in planning, execution, and monitoring.
