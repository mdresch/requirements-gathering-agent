# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This project, "Requirements Gathering Agent," aims to create an AI-powered system for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  The system will integrate with multiple AI providers, offer a CLI interface, and support template-based document creation.  The WBS will be created using a decomposition approach based on major deliverables and phases, further broken down into manageable work packages and, where necessary, individual activities.  The approach prioritizes a clear hierarchy, ensuring complete scope coverage and facilitating effective project management.


## WBS Hierarchy

### Level 1: Project (1.0) - Requirements Gathering Agent

1.0 Requirements Gathering Agent: Develop an AI-powered system for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation, integrating with multiple AI providers, and offering a CLI interface.

1.1 Core System Development: Develop the core functionality of the Requirements Gathering Agent, including AI integration, document generation engine, and context management.
1.2 API Development: Design, develop, and test the RESTful API for template management, document generation, and provider interaction.
1.3 CLI Development: Develop the command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction, configuration management, and batch processing.
1.4 Integration and Testing: Integrate all components, conduct thorough testing (unit, integration, system), and address identified bugs.
1.5 Deployment and Documentation: Deploy the application to a production environment and create comprehensive user documentation.
1.6 SharePoint Integration: Develop and implement the SharePoint integration module for document publishing.
1.7 Confluence Integration: Develop and implement the Confluence integration module for document publishing.

1.2.4 API Documentation: Generate Swagger documentation for the API.

**1.3 CLI Development:**

1.3.1 CLI Design and Specification: Define the CLI commands, options, and user interface.
1.3.2 CLI Implementation: Develop the CLI using TypeScript and a suitable CLI framework.
1.3.3 CLI Testing: Test the CLI to ensure functionality and usability.

**1.4 Integration and Testing:**

1.4.1 Component Integration: Integrate the core system, API, and CLI.
1.4.2 Unit Testing: Conduct unit tests for individual components.
1.4.3 Integration Testing: Conduct integration tests for interacting components.
1.4.4 System Testing: Conduct system tests to verify overall functionality.
1.4.5 Bug Fixing and Refinement: Address any bugs or issues identified during testing.


**1.5 Deployment and Documentation:**

1.5.1 Deployment to Production: Deploy the application to a production environment.
1.5.2 User Documentation: Create comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and FAQs.


**1.6 SharePoint Integration:**

1.6.1 Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure Azure AD authentication using the Microsoft Graph API.
1.6.2 Document Upload: Develop functionality to upload generated documents to SharePoint.
1.6.3 Metadata Management: Implement functionality to add relevant metadata to uploaded documents.
1.6.4 Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging for SharePoint interactions.

**1.7 Confluence Integration:** (Similar breakdown as SharePoint Integration)

**1.8 Project Management:**

1.8.1 Project Planning: Create a detailed project plan, including timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.
1.8.2 Project Execution: Oversee the execution of the project plan.
1.8.3 Project Monitoring: Monitor progress against the project plan and identify potential risks.
1.8.4 Project Reporting: Generate regular project reports to stakeholders.
1.8.5 Project Closure: Close the project and document lessons learned.



### Level 4: Activities (Examples -  This level would be significantly expanded in a full WBS)

Activities would be defined for each work package at this level.  For example, 1.1.1.1 might be "Design database schema for context management,"  1.1.1.2 might be "Implement context storage using MongoDB," and so on.


## Work Package Descriptions (Example -  This section would be significantly expanded in a full WBS)

| WBS Code | Work Package Name                     | Description                                                                                                    | Deliverables                                                              | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                  |
|---------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| 1.2.1   | API Design and Specification         | Define the API endpoints, request/response formats, and security protocols.                                   | API specification document (Swagger/OpenAPI)                              | API specification is complete, consistent, and adheres to best practices.                                      |
| 1.8.1   | Project Planning                     | Create a detailed project plan, including timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.                     | Project plan document, risk register                                      | Project plan is comprehensive, realistic, and approved by stakeholders.                                          |


## WBS Guidelines

* **Decomposition Principles:**  The WBS uses a functional decomposition approach, breaking down the project based on its major functions and deliverables.
* **Level of Detail Rationale:** The level of detail is sufficient to provide a clear understanding of the project scope and enable effective task assignment and monitoring. Further decomposition to Level 4 and beyond would be necessary for detailed project planning and execution.
* **Maintenance Procedures:** The WBS will be regularly reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in project scope or requirements.  Changes will be documented and communicated to the project team.


This WBS provides a foundational structure.  For a real-world project, each work package would require significantly more detail, including specific tasks, resource assignments, timelines, and dependencies.
