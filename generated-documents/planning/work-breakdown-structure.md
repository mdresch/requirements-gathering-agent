# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) outlines the work required for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, now known as the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA).  The WBS uses a hierarchical decomposition approach, breaking down the project into manageable work packages. The approach prioritizes PMBOK alignment and leverages the existing project documentation for a comprehensive scope definition.  The WBS will be maintained iteratively throughout the project lifecycle.

## Work Package Descriptions (Example -  Expand for all work packages)

This section would contain a detailed description for each work package identified in the WBS hierarchy above.  Each description would include:

* **WBS Code:** (e.g., 1.1.1)
* **Work Package Name:** (e.g., Project Charter Development)
* **Description:** A concise and clear explanation of the work involved.
* **Deliverables:**  Specific outputs expected from the work package.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  The conditions that must be met for the work package to be considered complete.  This will often include PMBOK compliance criteria.


**Example:**

* **WBS Code:** 1.1.1
* **Work Package Name:** Project Charter Development
* **Description:** Create a formal project charter document that outlines the project's objectives, scope, stakeholders, and high-level risks.  This document will serve as the official authorization for the project.
* **Deliverables:**  A complete and approved project charter document in markdown format.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** The project charter must be approved by the designated project sponsor and contain all required elements as defined by PMBOK 7.0 standards.


This WBS provides a robust framework for managing the ADPA project.  Remember to expand the Work Package Descriptions section with detailed information for each work package to ensure complete scope coverage and effective project management.
