# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) outlines the work required for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, now renamed Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA).  The WBS uses a decomposition approach based on major deliverables and phases, further broken down into manageable work packages.  The approach prioritizes clarity, completeness, and alignment with the project's PMBOK 7.0 compliance goals.

## WBS Guidelines

* **Decomposition Principles:**  The WBS uses a top-down decomposition approach, breaking down the project into progressively smaller and more manageable work packages.
* **Level of Detail:** The WBS provides sufficient detail to allow for accurate estimation, scheduling, and resource allocation. Further decomposition into activities can be done as needed.
* **Maintenance Procedures:** The WBS will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changes in project scope and requirements.  A change management process will be implemented to control updates.


This comprehensive WBS ensures complete coverage of the ADPA project scope, providing a solid foundation for planning, execution, and monitoring.  The level of detail can be further expanded as needed during project planning and execution.
