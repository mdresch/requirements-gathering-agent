# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) outlines the work required for the "ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API" project.  The WBS uses a hierarchical decomposition approach, breaking down the project into progressively smaller, manageable work packages.  The decomposition is guided by the project's major deliverables and functional areas as described in the project README.

## WBS Hierarchy

The WBS is structured in a four-level hierarchy for clarity and manageability:

**Level 1: Project**  (1.0)  ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Level 2: Major Deliverables/Phases** (1.1 - 1.5)

* 1.1 API Development and Deployment
* 1.2 Framework Generation Engine
* 1.3  Template Management System
* 1.4 Documentation and User Training
* 1.5 Testing and Quality Assurance

**Level 3: Work Packages** (1.1.1 - 1.5.3  and so on...) - Detailed below.

**Level 4: Activities** (Optional, implied within Level 3) - Activities are not explicitly listed but are implied within each work package description.  For example, "1.1.1 API Backend Development" would include activities such as coding, testing, and code reviews.


## Work Package Descriptions

**Level 1: 1.0 ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent**

* **Description:**  Develop and deploy a production-ready API for generating BABOK v3-compliant business analysis frameworks.  The system should leverage AI, support multiple output formats, and integrate with enterprise systems.
* **Deliverables:** Functional API, comprehensive documentation, deployment to production environment.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Successful generation of BABOK frameworks, API performance benchmarks met, security testing passed, and user acceptance testing completed.


**Level 2 & 3: Detailed Work Packages**

    * Deliverables:  UAT plan, UAT test results, feedback report.
    * Acceptance Criteria:  UAT passes, user feedback incorporated.


## WBS Guidelines

* **Decomposition Principles:**  The WBS uses a functional decomposition approach, breaking down the project based on its major functions and deliverables.
* **Level of Detail:** The level of detail is sufficient to provide a clear understanding of the work required without being overly granular.  Further decomposition into Level 4 activities could be added as needed during project execution.
* **Maintenance Procedures:** The WBS will be updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in scope or schedule.


This WBS provides a comprehensive framework for managing the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It ensures complete scope coverage and facilitates effective planning, execution, and monitoring of the project.
