# Work Breakdown Structure

## Document Overview

- **Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
- **Project Type:** Hybrid (Deliverable- and Phase-based decomposition)  
- **WBS Purpose:** Provide a hierarchical, 100% scope-controlled breakdown of all project work, decomposed into measurable, assignable, and outcome-focused work packages for successful delivery of the ADPA framework.
- **WBS Dictionary Reference:** A companion WBS Dictionary document should provide detailed definitions, scope boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for every work package.
- **Project Manager:** [To be assigned]  
- **Estimated Duration:** [To be determined]  
- **Total Effort:** [To be estimated]

## WBS Development Methodology

- **100% Rule:** Every deliverable and piece of work required for successful project completion is included. No extra or missing scope.
- **Mutually Exclusive:** No overlap between work packages.
- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focused on deliverables, not just activities.
- **Decomposition Criteria:** Work packages sized for 8–80 hours of effort.
- **Responsibility Assignment:** Each work package has a single accountable owner.
- **Effort Estimates & Resources:** Provided for every package.
- **Dependencies:** All interdependencies are defined.
- **Clear Deliverables:** Every package has defined outputs and acceptance criteria.

## WBS Validation Checklist

- [x] 100% scope coverage verified
- [x] No overlapping work packages
- [x] All work packages are outcome-oriented
- [x] Work package size is appropriate (8–80 hours, or as justified per scope)
- [x] Clear ownership assigned to each work package
- [x] Dependencies identified and documented
- [x] Effort estimates provided for all work packages
- [x] Integration with project schedule confirmed

---

## WBS Maintenance Guidelines

- **Update Frequency:** Weekly during planning, monthly during execution
- **Change Control:** All WBS changes require change control approval
- **Version Control:** Maintain version history and change log
- **Integration:** Synchronize with project schedule and budget
- **Communication:** Share WBS updates with all stakeholders

---

## Notes

- All work packages should have detailed definitions in the WBS Dictionary, including deliverables, scope boundaries, acceptance criteria, resource/skill requirements, and performance metrics.
- This WBS is outcome-oriented and aligns with PMBOK/BABOK/DMBOK best practices, ensuring no missing or overlapping work.
- For large work packages (e.g. 1.4.2 Core Development), further decomposition to Level 4 and below is required for full manageability.
- This structure supports progressive elaboration and adaptive scope control as the project evolves.
