# Work Breakdown Structure

## Document Overview
- **Project:** === PROJECT README ===  
  ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
- **Description:** Modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript automation framework for enterprise requirements, project, and data management. Provides CLI and API for BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 (in progress). Production-ready Express.js API with TypeSpec architecture. Designed for secure, scalable, and maintainable enterprise automation.  
- **Version:** 3.2.9  
- **WBS Purpose:** Hierarchical decomposition of all project work to ensure full scope coverage, clear deliverables, and assignment.  
- **Decomposition Approach:** Hybrid deliverable and phase-based decomposition aligned to project lifecycle and framework modules.  
- **WBS Dictionary Reference:** This document serves as the WBS dictionary with detailed work package descriptions, effort estimates, dependencies, and deliverables.  

---

## WBS Development Methodology
- **100% Rule:** All project scope elements included, no omissions or duplications.  
- **Mutually Exclusive:** Work packages are distinct with no overlap.  
- **Outcome-Oriented:** Focus on deliverables, outputs, or measurable results.  
- **Decomposition Criteria:** Work packages sized for 8-80 hours effort; manageable and assignable.  
- **Responsibility Assignment:** Each work package is assigned a responsible role/team.
