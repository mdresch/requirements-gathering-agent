# Activity Duration Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA)

## Document Overview

This document provides duration estimates for key activities in the Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) project.  The estimates are based on a combination of expert judgment, analogous estimating, and three-point estimating techniques, considering factors such as resource availability, complexity, and potential risks.  The primary focus is on development and testing activities, given the existing project progress.

## Estimation Methodology

### Techniques Used

* **Expert Judgment:** Estimates leverage the experience of the development team familiar with similar AI-powered projects and the complexities of integrating multiple AI providers.
* **Analogous Estimating:**  Duration estimates for similar tasks (e.g., developing individual document generators in past projects) were used as a basis for comparison.
* **Three-Point Estimating (PERT):**  This technique accounts for uncertainty by considering optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic scenarios for each activity duration.  The expected duration is calculated using the formula:  `(O + 4M + P) / 6`.

### Estimation Factors

* **Resource Productivity:** The development team consists of experienced engineers proficient in TypeScript, Node.js, and AI APIs.  Their productivity is considered high.
* **Resource Availability:**  A dedicated team is assumed to be available full-time for the duration of the project.
* **Work Environment:**  The team has access to adequate infrastructure, development tools, and collaborative platforms.
* **Complexity Factors:**  Integrating multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), managing large context windows, and ensuring PMBOK compliance add complexity to the project.


## Duration Estimates by Activity

The following activities are prioritized based on the project's current state and focus on remaining development and testing tasks.  Many initial activities (such as strategic planning and initial document generation) are assumed complete based on the project description.
