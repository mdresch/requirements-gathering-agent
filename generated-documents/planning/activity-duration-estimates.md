# Activity Duration Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) Project

## Document Overview

This document provides duration estimates for key activities in the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  Estimates are based on a combination of expert judgment, analogous estimating (drawing from past similar projects), and three-point estimating (PERT method) to account for uncertainty.  All durations are expressed in working days.

## Estimation Methodology

### Techniques Used

* **Expert Judgment:**  Estimates are informed by the project lead's extensive experience in AI development, software engineering, and project management.  Their expertise is crucial for assessing the complexity of AI model integration, context management, and document generation.
* **Analogous Estimating:**  Durations for similar tasks (e.g., CLI development, testing) are based on historical data from past projects with similar scope and complexity.
* **Three-Point Estimating (PERT):**  This method is used to account for uncertainty by considering optimistic (O), most likely (M), and pessimistic (P) estimates for each activity. The expected duration (E) is calculated as:  `E = (O + 4M + P) / 6`

### Estimation Factors

* **Resource Productivity:** The development team consists of experienced engineers, resulting in relatively high productivity.
* **Resource Availability:**  The team is dedicated to the RGA project full-time.
* **Work Environment:**  The team has access to necessary infrastructure and development tools.
* **Complexity Factors:** The project involves significant AI integration, requiring careful consideration of model selection, prompt engineering, and context management.

### Duration Analysis

* **Total Project Duration:** 140 days (approximately 4.7 months)
* **Critical Path:** ACT-001 -> ACT-003 -> ACT-007 -> ACT-009 -> ACT-010 -> ACT-011 -> ACT-012 -> ACT-013 -> ACT-014  (This is a simplified representation, a detailed Gantt chart would be necessary for precise critical path analysis.)
* **Project Buffer:** A 10% buffer (14 days) is recommended to account for unforeseen issues and delays.  This brings the total estimated project duration to approximately 154 days.


**Note:** These are estimates.  Actual durations may vary depending on unforeseen challenges, resource availability, and other factors.  Regular monitoring and progress updates will be crucial to managing the project timeline effectively.  A detailed Gantt chart would provide a more visual and comprehensive representation of the project schedule, including dependencies and milestones.
