# Activity Duration Estimates for ADPA Project

## Document Overview

This document provides detailed duration estimates for key activities within the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project.  The estimates utilize a combination of expert judgment, analogous estimating, and three-point estimating techniques to account for uncertainty and risk.  The estimates are presented in person-days, assuming a standard 8-hour workday.

## Estimation Methodology

### Techniques Used

* **Expert Judgment:**  Estimates are informed by the experience of the development team (estimated 5+ years of experience in Node.js, TypeScript, and AI integration).  Specific expertise in BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK standards is leveraged.
* **Analogous Estimating:**  Duration estimates for similar features in past projects with comparable complexity are used as a baseline.
* **Three-Point Estimating:**  A PERT/Beta distribution approach is used to account for uncertainty.  Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), and Pessimistic (P) estimates are provided for each activity.  The expected duration (E) is calculated as (O + 4M + P) / 6.

### Estimation Factors

* **Resource Productivity:**  The development team's productivity is considered average to high for experienced developers.
* **Resource Availability:**  Full-time resources are assumed for core development activities.  Part-time resources may be used for integration tasks with external vendors.
* **Work Environment:**  A well-equipped development environment with access to necessary tools and infrastructure is assumed.
* **Complexity Factors:**  Complexity is assessed based on the number of integrations, the sophistication of AI models used, and the overall scope of the feature.

## Duration Estimates by Activity

The following activities are categorized into phases for better organization.  Note that these are high-level activities; more granular breakdown would be necessary for precise project scheduling.

## Duration Summary

**Total Project Duration (Expected):** Approximately 76 person-days (around 10 weeks, assuming 8 person-days per week)

**Critical Path:** ACT-001 -> ACT-002 -> ACT-003 -> ACT-010 -> ACT-013

**Project Buffer:** A 10% buffer (7.6 person-days) is recommended to account for unforeseen issues and delays.

**Note:** These are high-level estimates.  A more detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and activity list are needed for a more precise project schedule.  This estimation does not include time for potential rework or unexpected issues.  Regular monitoring and progress tracking are crucial for successful project completion.
