# Activity List: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## Document Overview

This Activity List decomposes the work packages of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project into specific, actionable activities.  It's aligned with the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and supports the overall project objectives outlined in the project charter and related documents.  Activities are identified using a consistent methodology, focusing on measurability, assignability, and alignment with project goals.

## Activity Definitions

The following activities are categorized by project phase, although some activities may span multiple phases.  Effort estimates are provided in days, and are high-level estimates requiring further refinement during detailed planning.
