# Activity List: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## Document Overview

This Activity List decomposes the work packages for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project into specific, actionable activities.  It's aligned with the project's Work Breakdown Structure (implied from the provided documentation) and uses a consistent identification methodology.  Activities are defined to be measurable, assignable, and directly support the project's objectives of creating a production-ready API for generating BABOK v3 compliant frameworks.

## Activity Definitions

The following activities are grouped by logical phases, though some activities might span multiple phases.  Effort estimates are preliminary and should be refined during detailed planning.

### Project Phase: API Development

#### Work Package: API Core Functionality -  Development of core API endpoints for framework generation.

**Activity ID:** ACT-001

**Description:** Design the RESTful API endpoints for framework generation (POST `/api/v1/documents/convert`, GET `/api/v1/documents/jobs`, GET `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`, GET `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}`) including request/response schemas using OpenAPI 3.0.
**Deliverable:** OpenAPI 3.0 specification document for core API endpoints.
**Effort Estimate:** 16 hours
**Skills Required:** API design, OpenAPI, RESTful principles
**Constraints:**  Dependencies on TypeSpec definition.
**Assumptions:**  Existing TypeSpec definitions are available.


**Activity ID:** ACT-002
**Activity Name:** Implement API Endpoints
**Description:** Develop the backend code for the core API endpoints using Express.js, TypeScript, and appropriate middleware (authentication, validation, logging).
**Deliverable:** Functional implementation of core API endpoints.
**Effort Estimate:** 48 hours
**Skills Required:** Express.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Middleware development
**Constraints:**  Dependencies on API design and database schema.
**Assumptions:** Database schema is defined and implemented.


**Activity ID:** ACT-003
**Activity Name:** Implement Input Validation
**Description:** Implement robust input validation using Zod schemas to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
**Deliverable:**  Validated input schemas for all API endpoints.
**Effort Estimate:** 12 hours
**Skills Required:** Zod, TypeScript, Data validation techniques
**Constraints:**  Dependencies on API endpoint implementation.
**Assumptions:** API endpoints are implemented.


**Activity ID:** ACT-004

**Deliverable:** Secure API endpoints with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
**Effort Estimate:** 24 hours
**Skills Required:** Authentication mechanisms (API keys, JWT), Express.js middleware
**Constraints:**  None.
**Assumptions:**  Security best practices are followed.


**Activity ID:** ACT-005
**Activity Name:** Implement Error Handling
**Description:** Implement comprehensive error handling to provide informative error messages and graceful degradation.
**Deliverable:**  Error handling implemented across all API endpoints.
**Effort Estimate:** 8 hours
**Skills Required:** Error handling best practices, Express.js error handling
**Constraints:** Dependencies on API endpoint implementation.
**Assumptions:**  API endpoints are implemented.


**Activity ID:** ACT-006
**Activity Name:** Implement Logging and Monitoring
**Description:** Implement structured logging with request tracing for debugging and monitoring.
