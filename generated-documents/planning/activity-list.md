# Activity List: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) Project

## Document Overview

This Activity List decomposes the work packages of the Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) project into specific, actionable activities.  It is aligned with the project's Work Breakdown Structure (implied from the provided documentation) and supports the project objectives of delivering a robust, AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator. Activities are defined to be measurable, assignable, and directly contribute to project deliverables.  The activity identification methodology uses a combination of bottom-up (decomposing existing features) and top-down (defining necessary tasks for new features) approaches.

## Activity Definitions

The following activities are categorized by project phase, although some activities may span multiple phases.  Effort estimates are in hours and are preliminary, requiring refinement during detailed planning.
