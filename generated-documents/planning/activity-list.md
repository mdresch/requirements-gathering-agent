# Activity List: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) Project

## Document Overview

This Activity List details the tasks required to complete the Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) project.  It's aligned with the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) – implicitly defined through the project documentation – and uses a consistent activity identification methodology.  Activities are defined to be measurable, assignable, and directly support project objectives.

## Activity Definitions

The following activities are categorized by project phase, although some activities may span multiple phases. Effort estimates are in hours and are rough approximations.  Actual effort will depend on various factors.

**Note:**  The provided project context lacks an explicit WBS.  Therefore, the WBS codes below are derived from the project phases and document types mentioned in the README.  A more formal WBS would improve the precision of this Activity List.


### Project Phase: Strategic Business Inception

### Project Phase: Documentation & Deployment

This section would include activities for creating user guides, tutorials, deploying the tool to npm, and creating release notes.


## Activity Summary

This section would provide a summarized view of all activities, including a categorized activity inventory and counts for each category (Development, Testing, Documentation, Management).  This would require populating the table above and then creating a summary table.


This Activity List provides a framework.  Further refinement is necessary based on a more detailed WBS and a more precise understanding of dependencies between activities.  The effort estimates are preliminary and should be revisited during detailed planning.
