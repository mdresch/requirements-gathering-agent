## Document Overview

This Activity List document provides a detailed decomposition of the ADPA project work packages into specific, actionable activities. It supports project planning, assignment, progress tracking, and ensures alignment with project objectives such as enterprise automation of document generation, AI integration, standards compliance, and secure scalable architecture.

This list directly supports the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and serves as a foundation for scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management.

**Activity Identification Methodology:**  
Activities were identified by analyzing the project scope, key features, architecture, integration points, compliance requirements, and deliverables described in the project README, metadata, and design specifications. Each activity is measurable, assignable, and aligned to the enterprise automation goals.
