# Activity List: Project Backup Vermigerous

## Document Overview

This Activity List details the tasks required to improve the backup process for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automation and secure recovery.  It supports the project objectives by breaking down the work into specific, measurable, assignable, and time-estimated activities.  This list is not tied to a formal Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) but can easily be mapped to one if needed. Activities are identified using a combination of phase, work package, and a unique sequential identifier.


## Activity Definitions

### Activity Categories

- **Development Activities:** 7 (and growing) - Primarily focused on scripting and automation.
- **Testing Activities:**  (To be added in later phases) - Will include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- **Documentation Activities:** (To be added in later phases) - Includes creating design documents, technical documentation, and user guides.
- **Management Activities:** (To be added in later phases) - Includes project planning, progress tracking, and stakeholder communication.


This Activity List provides a foundation.  As the project progresses, more activities will be added, and effort estimates will be refined.  This list should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect the project's evolving needs.
