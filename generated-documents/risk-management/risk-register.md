## 3. Risk Category Analysis

### Technical Risks
- **Enterprise Authentication Gaps**: Risk T1—Delays or failure in Entra ID/RBAC/MFA implementation could expose sensitive data and violate compliance (Probability: High, Impact: Very High).
- **AI Provider Integration Complexity**: Risk T2—Frequent updates or differing APIs for OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub, and Ollama raise instability and maintenance risks.
- **API/Dependency Security**: Risk T3—Large dependency tree (npm, third-party SDKs) increases attack surface.
- **Performance/Scalability**: Risk T4—Heavy workloads (document generation, AI inference) may exceed Node.js performance limits without robust architecture.
- **Usability**: Risk T5—CLI/web/admin feature drift may erode user trust.

### Operational Risks
- **Resource Availability & Skills**: Risk O1—Shortage of skilled TypeScript/Node.js/AI engineers is a critical bottleneck.
- **Compliance Complexity**: Risk O2—Multi-framework (BABOK/PMBOK/DMBOK) compliance increases delivery complexity and risk of missed requirements.
- **Test Coverage**: Risk O3—Insufficient automated tests or process discipline raises defect escape risk.
- **Integration Fragility**: Risk O4—Frequent breaking changes in SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe APIs.
- **Scope Creep**: Risk O5—AI-powered automation and “in-progress” DMBOK features increase scope change risk.
- **Release Delays**: Risk O6—Delays in Docker/K8s readiness may disrupt enterprise adoption plans.

### External Risks
- **Regulatory Shifts**: Risk E1—Frequent changes in GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III require rapid adaptation.
- **AI Vendor Lock-In**: Risk E2—Reliance on cloud AI vendors exposes project to external shocks.

### Organizational Risks

## 4. Risk Response Strategies

### Risk Response Types

- **Avoid**: For T1, E1—Accelerate enterprise security integration to avoid compliance breaches.
- **Mitigate**: For T2, O1, F1—Proactive testing, cross-training, and cost monitoring.
- **Transfer**: For E2—Negotiate vendor SLAs, consider insurance for cloud spend.

### Contingency Plans

| Risk ID | Trigger Events | Contingency Response | Resources Required | Timeline |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|
| T1 | Security audit failure; unauthorized access detected | Immediate incident response; roll back to last secure config; notify affected parties; expedite Entra ID deployment | Security team, audit logs, IT support | 24 hours from trigger |
| T2 | Multiple AI provider outages or integration failures | Switch to backup provider; notify users; initiate patch/hotfix process | DevOps, backup configs, provider credentials | 1-3 hours |
| O1 | Key developer resigns or becomes unavailable | Activate cross-trained backup; accelerate onboarding for new resources; re-baseline schedule | HR, project leads, onboarding docs | 1 week |
| F1 | Monthly AI/cloud spend exceeds budget threshold | Freeze non-essential workloads; review high-cost operations; seek emergency budget approval | Finance, PM, cost dashboards | 48 hours |
| E1 | New regulation announced impacting current architecture | Pause impacted features; initiate compliance impact assessment; consult legal | Compliance/legal, architect, PM | 1 week |
