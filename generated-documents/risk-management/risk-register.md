## 1. Risk Management Summary

This Risk Register identifies, analyzes, and documents project risks for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  The assessment utilizes a 1-5 scale for both probability and impact, with a risk score calculated as Probability x Impact.

**Probability Scale:** 1 (Very Low), 2 (Low), 3 (Medium), 4 (High), 5 (Very High)
**Impact Scale:** 1 (Very Low), 2 (Low), 3 (Medium), 4 (High), 5 (Very High)
**Risk Score Interpretation:** 1-5 (Low), 6-10 (Medium), 11-15 (High), 16-25 (Critical)

## 3. Risk Response Strategies & Contingency Plans

The mitigation strategies outlined above are designed to proactively address identified risks.  Contingency plans will be developed for each high-priority risk, detailing specific actions, resources, and timelines for response in the event of a risk occurrence.  These will be documented separately in a dedicated contingency plan document.

## 4. Risk Monitoring and Control

**Risk Review Schedule:** Weekly project team meetings, monthly progress reports to stakeholders.
**Escalation Criteria:** High-priority risks (score 11-15) escalated to the Project Manager; Critical risks (score 16+) escalated to the Executive Sponsor.


This Risk Register will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in project status and emerging risks.  The KRI's listed above will be actively monitored to provide early warning signals of potential issues.
