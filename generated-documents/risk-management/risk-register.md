## ðŸŽ¯ **AI-GENERATED RISK ASSESSMENT**

This Risk Register leverages the Requirements Gathering Agent's advanced capabilities to synthesize information from the project README, Business Case, Scope Statement, and Stakeholder Register to identify and assess project risks.  Probabilities and Impacts are scored on a scale of 1-5 (1=Very Low, 5=Very High). Risk Score = Probability x Impact.

## 1. Risk Assessment Scale

**Probability Scale:**
- **Very Low (1)**: 1-10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2)**: 11-30% chance of occurrence
- **Medium (3)**: 31-50% chance of occurrence
- **High (4)**: 51-70% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5)**: 71-90% chance of occurrence

**Impact Scale:**
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact on project objectives
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, easily manageable
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact, requires attention
- **High (4)**: Significant impact, major management required
- **Very High (5)**: Severe impact, project success threatened

**Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**
- **1-5**: Low Risk (Monitor)
- **6-10**: Medium Risk (Manage)
- **11-15**: High Risk (Immediate Action)
- **16-25**: Critical Risk (Escalate)
