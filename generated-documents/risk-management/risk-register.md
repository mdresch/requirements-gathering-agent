## 1. Risk Management Summary

### Risk Assessment Scale

**Probability Scale:**
- **Very Low (1)**: 1-10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2)**: 11-30% chance of occurrence
- **Medium (3)**: 31-50% chance of occurrence
- **High (4)**: 51-70% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5)**: 71-90% chance of occurrence

**Impact Scale:**
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact on project objectives
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, easily manageable
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact, requires attention
- **High (4)**: Significant impact, major management required
- **Very High (5)**: Severe impact, project success threatened

**Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**
- **1-5**: Low Risk (Monitor)
- **6-10**: Medium Risk (Manage)
- **11-15**: High Risk (Immediate Action)
- **16-25**: Critical Risk (Escalate)

## 3. Risk Category Analysis

This section provides a detailed breakdown of risks categorized by type:

**Technical Risks:** Primarily focus on the reliability and accuracy of the AI models, potential integration issues with various APIs and external systems (SharePoint, Confluence), and the scalability of the system to handle increasing user demand.

**Operational Risks:** Center on resource allocation (developer time, server capacity), the need for effective user training and support, and the efficient management of the development process itself.

**External Risks:** Include the risk of API provider outages or service disruptions, as well as potential reputational damage from negative publicity or user feedback.

**Organizational Risks:** Cover the challenges of user adoption and training, ensuring that the tool is effectively integrated into existing workflows, and the potential for conflicting priorities between stakeholders.

**Financial Risks:** Focus on the possibility of cost overruns due to unexpected development time or complexity.

## 4. Risk Response Strategies

This section details the chosen response strategies for each identified risk, including contingency plans.  The strategies prioritize mitigation and transfer, with acceptance only for low-probability, low-impact risks.  Avoidance is not practical for most risks in this project, as it would involve major changes to the project's core functionality.


### Contingency Plans

| Risk ID | Trigger Events | Contingency Response | Resources Required | Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| R-1 | High error rate in automated testing, significant user complaints about factual errors. | Pause new feature development, prioritize bug fixing and validation improvements.  Implement additional data verification methods. | Development team, QA team | 1-2 weeks |
| R-2 | Prolonged API downtime (exceeding 24 hours) for primary provider. | Switch to secondary AI provider.  Inform users of temporary service disruption.  | DevOps team, communications team | Immediate switch, communication within 24 hours |
| R-3 | System resource utilization exceeds 95% for 48 hours. | Implement emergency scaling measures (additional server instances).  Investigate performance bottlenecks. | DevOps team, system architect | Immediate scaling, performance analysis within 72 hours |
