## 1. Risk Management Summary

### Risk Assessment Scale

**Probability Scale:**  
- **Very Low (1)**: 1-10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2)**: 11-30% chance of occurrence  
- **Medium (3)**: 31-50% chance of occurrence
- **High (4)**: 51-70% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5)**: 71-90% chance of occurrence

**Impact Scale:**  
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact on project objectives
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, easily manageable
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact, requires attention  
- **High (4)**: Significant impact, major management required
- **Very High (5)**: Severe impact, project success threatened

**Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**  
- **1-5**: Low Risk (Monitor)
- **6-10**: Medium Risk (Manage)  
- **11-15**: High Risk (Immediate Action)
- **16-25**: Critical Risk (Escalate)

## 3. Risk Category Analysis

**Technical Risks:**  High probability of API limitations (R1) and model inaccuracies (R2) due to the reliance on external AI services.  Minor bugs (R7) are expected after release, requiring ongoing maintenance.

**Operational Risks:**  Potential resource constraints (R5) and development delays (R4) are significant concerns.  Effective project management and resource planning are crucial.

**External Risks:**  Market competition (R6) and AI provider changes (R8) pose moderate threats that require proactive monitoring and contingency planning.

**Organizational Risks:**  Failure to meet stakeholder expectations (R3) is a major risk that necessitates ongoing communication and feedback loops.

**Financial Risks:**  While not explicitly identified as high-priority, cost overruns related to R4 and R5 and potential loss of revenue due to R6 are implicit financial risks.
