## 1. Risk Management Summary

### Risk Assessment Scale

**Probability Scale:**
- **Very Low (1)**: 1-10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2)**: 11-30% chance of occurrence
- **Medium (3)**: 31-50% chance of occurrence
- **High (4)**: 51-70% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5)**: 71-90% chance of occurrence

**Impact Scale:**
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact on project objectives
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, easily manageable
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact, requires attention
- **High (4)**: Significant impact, major management required
- **Very High (5)**: Severe impact, project success threatened

**Risk Score = Probability × Impact**
- **1-5**: Low Risk (Monitor)
- **6-10**: Medium Risk (Manage)
- **11-15**: High Risk (Immediate Action)
- **16-25**: Critical Risk (Escalate)

## 3. Risk Category Analysis

**Technical Risks:**  The project relies heavily on multiple AI providers and their APIs.  Integration complexities, API downtime, and unforeseen technical challenges during development are significant risks.  Security vulnerabilities in API integrations are also a major concern.

**Operational Risks:**  Resource allocation, skill gaps, and potential schedule delays are key operational concerns.  Ensuring user adoption of the new system also presents an operational challenge.

**External Risks:**  Dependence on single vendors for AI services and the need to comply with international regulations pose external risks.  Market changes and competitive pressures also need to be considered.

**Organizational Risks:**  Not directly identified in provided documentation.  Further stakeholder analysis might reveal potential organizational risks.

**Financial Risks:**  Budget overruns are a potential risk, especially given the complexity of the project and the reliance on external services.
