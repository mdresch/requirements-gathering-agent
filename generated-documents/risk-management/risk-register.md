## 1. Risk Management Summary

This Risk Register identifies, analyzes, and documents project risks impacting the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  It uses a 1-5 scale for both probability and impact, with a risk score calculated as Probability x Impact.

**Probability Scale:** 1 (Very Low), 2 (Low), 3 (Medium), 4 (High), 5 (Very High)
**Impact Scale:** 1 (Very Low), 2 (Low), 3 (Medium), 4 (High), 5 (Very High)
**Risk Score Interpretation:** 1-5 (Low), 6-10 (Medium), 11-15 (High), 16-25 (Critical)

## 2. Project Risk Register

### High-Priority Risks (Score: 11-25)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Risk Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Status | Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R01 | **AI Provider API Outage or Instability:**  A critical AI provider (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) experiences an outage or significant performance degradation, halting document generation. | External | 3 | 5 | 15 | CTO |  Implement a multi-provider strategy with automatic failover.  Establish Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with providers. Monitor provider status using external APIs and implement alerts. | Open | API response time exceeding 5 seconds, error rate > 1%, provider status API reporting issues. |
| R02 | **Data Security Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive client data (e.g., financial data from Fortune 500 companies) used for framework generation. | Technical/External | 2 | 5 | 10 | CSO | Implement robust security measures including encryption at rest and in transit, secure API key management, regular penetration testing, and adherence to relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). | Open |  Number of security alerts, failed authentication attempts, unauthorized access logs. |
| R03 | **Unexpected High Demand/Scalability Issues:**  The API experiences unexpectedly high demand exceeding its capacity, leading to service disruptions. | Operational | 3 | 4 | 12 | DevOps | Implement horizontal scaling using cloud infrastructure (e.g., autoscaling in AWS or Azure). Optimize database queries and API responses. Implement rate limiting and queuing mechanisms. | Open | API response time, server CPU/memory utilization, queue length. |
| R04 | **Regulatory Compliance Failure:**  The generated documents fail to comply with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, Basel III, MiFID II), leading to legal issues. | External/Technical | 2 | 5 | 10 | Legal Counsel |  Implement rigorous validation against relevant regulatory standards within the document generation process.  Conduct regular compliance audits.  Maintain up-to-date knowledge of regulatory changes. | Open | Number of compliance violations flagged by validation, audit findings. |


### Medium-Priority Risks (Score: 6-10)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Risk Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Status | Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R05 | **Inadequate Testing Coverage:** Insufficient testing leads to undiscovered bugs in production, causing errors or unexpected behavior. | Technical | 4 | 3 | 12 | QA Lead | Expand unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Implement continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline with automated testing. | Open | Number of bugs found in production, test coverage percentage, time spent on bug fixing. |
| R06 | **Template Management Complexity:** Managing and updating numerous templates becomes difficult, slowing down development and increasing error potential. | Operational | 3 | 3 | 9 | Development Lead | Implement a robust template management system with version control, clear naming conventions, and automated testing for updates. | Open | Time spent on template maintenance, number of template updates, user feedback on template usability. |
| R07 | **Integration with Third-Party Tools Failure:** Difficulties integrating with third-party project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) reduce system usability. | Technical | 3 | 2 | 6 | Integration Lead |  Develop clear integration specifications and conduct thorough compatibility testing with target third-party tools. Provide detailed integration documentation.  | Open | Number of successful integrations, user feedback on integration process. |


### Low-Priority Risks (Score: 1-5)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Probability | Impact | Risk Score | Risk Owner | Mitigation Strategy | Status | Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R08 | **Insufficient User Documentation:** Poor or incomplete user documentation hinders user adoption and increases support requests. | Operational | 2 | 2 | 4 | Documentation Lead |  Develop comprehensive user documentation, tutorials, and FAQs.  Conduct user testing of documentation.  | Open | Number of user support requests, user feedback on documentation clarity. |
| R09 | **Unforeseen Technical Debt:** Accumulation of technical debt slows down future development and increases maintenance costs. | Technical | 2 | 1 | 2 | Tech Lead | Implement a strategy for proactively addressing technical debt. Regularly review code for maintainability and refactor as needed. | Open |  Code complexity metrics, time spent on bug fixes vs. new features. |
| R10 | **Market Acceptance Risk:** The market does not adopt the product as quickly as anticipated, impacting ROI. | External | 2 | 2 | 4 | Marketing Lead |  Develop a comprehensive marketing and sales strategy.  Conduct market research to identify target audience and adjust marketing efforts as needed. | Open | Number of new users, customer acquisition cost, marketing campaign effectiveness. |
