1. Change Request Information

Change Request ID: CR-001 (or your project's next sequential ID)

Title: Integration of Palantir Foundry for Enhanced Project Context

Requester: [Name of PMO Director or Project Sponsor]

Date Submitted: [Date of Submission]

Priority: High (Justification: Foundational to enhancing data-driven decision-making and automation, core project goals).

2. Description of Change

Summary: This section should concisely describe the "what" and "why" of the change.

Example: "This change proposes the integration of the ADPA framework with the Palantir Foundry platform. The integration will enable ADPA to query Foundry for real-time project context (e.g., risks, milestones, resources) to provide more accurate, relevant, and secure responses to user prompts. This change is a direct response to the strategic goal of leveraging existing enterprise data platforms to maximize ADPA's value."

3. Justification and Business Value

This is the core of the proposal, linking the change directly to the project's objectives and the organization's strategic goals.

Alignment with Project Charter: Explicitly state how this integration supports the charter's goals.

Example: "This integration directly supports the project's user adoption KPIs by improving the quality and reliability of ADPA's outputs. It aligns with the charter's 'API-first' architectural principle and the commitment to meeting regulatory requirements like GDPR by leveraging Foundry's existing data governance controls."

Benefits: List the tangible and intangible benefits.

Improved decision-making: Providing leaders with context-rich, accurate answers.

Increased efficiency: Automating the retrieval of project data.

Enhanced security: Leveraging Foundry's robust data access controls.

Higher ROI: Maximizing the value of both the ADPA and Palantir investments.

4. Impact Analysis

This section details the results of the initial Phase 1: Discovery & Feasibility Analysis.

Scope Impact:

"The change introduces a new integration module within the ADPA architecture. The deliverable is a functional connection to the Foundry API for data retrieval. Out of scope for this change is data write-back functionality."

Schedule Impact:

"The initial estimate is an additional X weeks to the project timeline, to be refined during the detailed planning phase. See attached preliminary project plan update."

Cost/Budget Impact:

"A budget increase of $Y is requested to cover resource costs for development, testing, and project management. This includes Z hours for the Solution Architect, Developer, and QA Lead."

Resource Impact:

"Requires allocation of the core ADPA technical team and engagement from the Foundry platform owner and enterprise security team."

Risk Impact:

"Initial risks identified include: dependency on Foundry API stability, potential for data mapping complexities ('Ontology Drift'), and the need for new security protocols. A detailed risk assessment will be maintained in the project's risk register."

5. Solution and Implementation Plan

Summarize the proposed technical solution and the high-level plan.

Proposed Solution:

"The Solution Architect has confirmed feasibility. The proposed solution involves developing a dedicated microservice within ADPA that authenticates with Foundry's API, translates user queries into data requests, and feeds the retrieved context into the prompt engineering workflow."

High-Level Plan:

"The integration will follow the 4-phased approach (Discovery, Planning, Implementation, Deployment) as outlined in the PMO Director's strategic plan. This change request officially concludes Phase 1 and seeks approval to proceed to Phase 2: Planning & Design."
