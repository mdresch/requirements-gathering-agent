# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the plan for managing requirements throughout the lifecycle of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This plan details how requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, validated, and managed to ensure the final product meets stakeholder needs and aligns with project objectives.

**2. Project Scope and Objectives**

ADPA's scope encompasses the development of a command-line interface (CLI) tool capable of generating a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents. This includes:

* **Strategic Documents:**  Purpose statements, company values, mission and vision statements.
* **Core Analysis:** Project summaries, user stories, personas, needs analysis.
* **Project Charter:** Formal project authorization.
* **Management Plans:** Scope, risk, cost, quality, resource, communication, and procurement plans.
* **Planning Artifacts:** WBS, WBS dictionary, activity list, schedule, milestones.
* **Stakeholder Management:** Stakeholder register, engagement plan, analysis.
* **Technical Analysis:** Technology stack, data model suggestions, risk analysis, acceptance criteria, compliance considerations, UI/UX considerations.
* **Technical Design Documents:** Architecture design, system design, database schema, API documentation, security design, performance requirements, integration design, technical stack, deployment architecture, error handling.

The primary objective is to deliver a robust, reliable, and user-friendly tool that significantly improves project documentation efficiency and quality while adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Secondary objectives include supporting multiple AI providers and implementing a built-in version control system.

**3. Requirements Elicitation**

Requirements will be elicited through a combination of techniques:

* **Analysis of Existing Documentation:**  The project's README, existing documents (like `ARCHITECTURE.MD`, `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE-PROVIDER-CHOICE-MENU.MD`, etc.), and related GitHub issues and discussions will be thoroughly analyzed to capture existing requirements.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:** Interviews with key stakeholders (project managers, business analysts, developers) will be conducted to gather additional requirements and clarify ambiguities.
* **Prototyping and User Feedback:**  Early prototypes will be developed and tested to gather user feedback, which will inform iterative refinements to the requirements.

**4. Requirements Analysis and Documentation**

The elicited requirements will be analyzed to identify inconsistencies, redundancies, and conflicts.  This analysis will be documented in a requirements specification document, using a consistent format (e.g., a table with requirement ID, description, priority, source, and status).  The requirements will be categorized into functional and non-functional requirements:


**4.1 Functional Requirements:**  These describe the specific functions the ADPA tool must perform. Examples include:

* Generate a PMBOK-compliant project charter.
* Generate a stakeholder register.
* Integrate with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.
* Support command-line arguments for customizing document generation.
* Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* Implement a version control system for generated documents.
* Provide comprehensive quality assessment of generated documents.
* Allow for user-specified output formats (markdown, JSON, YAML).
* Implement a modular architecture allowing for extensibility.


**4.2 Non-Functional Requirements:** These describe the qualities and characteristics of the ADPA tool. Examples include:

* **Performance:**  The tool should generate documents within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 minutes for a typical project).
* **Security:**  The tool should securely handle API keys and sensitive data.
* **Usability:** The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use.
* **Scalability:** The tool should be able to handle large projects with extensive documentation.
* **Reliability:** The tool should be robust and error-tolerant.
* **Maintainability:** The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.
* **Portability:** The tool should run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).


**5. Requirements Validation and Verification**

Requirements will be validated through:

* **Requirements Reviews:** Formal reviews will be conducted by stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
* **Prototyping and Testing:** Prototypes will be tested to verify that the system meets the specified requirements.  Unit tests will be written to ensure individual components function correctly. Integration tests will ensure the interaction between different components and third-party services.
* **PMBOK Compliance Checks:**  Generated documents will be reviewed against PMBOK 7.0 standards to ensure compliance.

**6. Requirements Traceability**

A traceability matrix will be maintained to link requirements to design specifications, test cases, and implementation details. This will ensure that all requirements are addressed and that changes to requirements are properly tracked and managed.

**7. Requirements Change Management**

A formal change management process will be implemented to handle requests for changes to requirements.  All change requests will be evaluated, documented, and approved by stakeholders before implementation.  The impact of change requests on project scope, schedule, and cost will be carefully assessed.

**8. Requirements Management Tools**

The following tools will be used to manage requirements:

* **Git:** For version control of requirements documents and code.
* **Spreadsheet Software (e.g., Excel or Google Sheets):** For creating and maintaining the requirements traceability matrix.
* **Project Management Software (e.g., Jira or Azure DevOps):** For tracking change requests and managing issues.

**9. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the entire requirements management process.
* **Business Analyst:** Responsible for eliciting, analyzing, and documenting requirements.
* **Developers:** Responsible for implementing and testing the system.
* **Stakeholders:** Provide input and feedback on requirements.


**10. Schedule**

The requirements management activities will be integrated into the overall project schedule.  Key milestones will include:

* Requirements elicitation completion.
* Requirements specification document completion.
* Requirements validation completion.
* Requirements traceability matrix completion.

**11. Acceptance Criteria**

The ADPA tool will be considered complete and acceptable when:

* All functional and non-functional requirements are met.
* The generated documents are PMBOK 7.0 compliant.
* The tool passes all planned testing and validation procedures.
* Stakeholders sign-off on the final product.

This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in project scope and requirements.  This ensures that the ADPA project remains focused on delivering a high-quality product that meets the needs of its stakeholders.
