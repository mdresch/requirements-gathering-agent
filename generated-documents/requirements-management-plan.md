# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Requirements Management Plan for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It details the processes, procedures, and tools used to manage requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  The plan adheres to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines and leverages the project's own AI capabilities for enhanced analysis and traceability.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objective of the ADPA project is to develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered tool that automates the generation of comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project documentation. Key objectives include:

*   Generating a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents.
*   Supporting multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Implementing a modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability.
*   Providing a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
*   Ensuring high-quality output through validation and quality assessment mechanisms.
*   Maintaining a version control system for generated documents.


**3. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**

The ADPA project will utilize a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to link requirements to design, implementation, and testing activities. The RTM will be dynamically updated using the project's AI capabilities, ensuring traceability and consistency.  The RTM will include, at a minimum, the following fields:

*   Requirement ID
*   Requirement Description
*   Source Document
*   Priority
*   Status (e.g., Proposed, Approved, Implemented, Verified)
*   Associated Design Elements
*   Associated Test Cases
*   Notes/Comments

**4. Requirements Elicitation & Analysis**

Requirements will be elicited from multiple sources, including:

*   Stakeholder interviews and workshops
*   Analysis of existing project documentation (README, design docs, etc.)
*   AI-powered analysis of project context (leveraging ADPA's own capabilities).

Requirements analysis will involve:

*   Prioritization of requirements based on value, feasibility, and risk.
*   Identification and resolution of conflicts between requirements.
*   Validation of requirements against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
*   Decomposition of high-level requirements into detailed user stories.


**5. Requirements Management Tools**

*   **ADPA itself:** The project will leverage ADPA's built-in capabilities for requirements analysis, prioritization, and traceability.
*   **Git:** Version control for all project documentation and the RTM.
*   **Spreadsheet Software (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel):**  For maintaining the RTM in a structured format (initially).  This will transition to an integrated solution within ADPA in future releases.
*   **Issue Tracking System (e.g., GitHub Issues):** For managing requirement changes and defects.


**6. Requirements Change Management**

All changes to requirements will be formally documented and reviewed. The process will include:

*   Submission of a change request with justification.
*   Assessment of the impact of the change on scope, schedule, and cost.
*   Approval by the appropriate stakeholders.
*   Update of the RTM and other relevant documentation.
*   Verification and validation of the implemented changes.


**7. Requirements Verification & Validation**

Verification and validation activities will be integrated throughout the project lifecycle.  Techniques will include:

*   Reviews of requirements documents and specifications.
*   Prototyping and user testing of the system.
*   Automated testing of the system's functionality and compliance with PMBOK standards.
*   AI-powered quality assessment of generated documents.


**8. Requirements Documentation**

All requirements will be documented in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner.  Documentation will include:

*   User stories
*   Use cases
*   Functional requirements specifications
*   Non-functional requirements specifications
*   Requirements traceability matrix (RTM)


**9. Roles and Responsibilities**

*   **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for requirements management.
*   **Business Analyst:** Responsible for requirements elicitation, analysis, and documentation.
*   **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing and testing the requirements.
*   **Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing and approving requirements.


**10. Metrics and Reporting**

Key metrics to be tracked include:

*   Number of requirements
*   Number of requirements changes
*   Time spent on requirements management
*   Requirement defect rate
*   Requirement completion rate
*   Quality scores for generated documents

Regular reports will be generated to monitor progress and identify potential issues.


**11. Risk Management**

Risks associated with requirements management include:

*   Incomplete or ambiguous requirements
*   Unrealistic deadlines
*   Lack of stakeholder involvement
*   Changes in project scope
*   AI model limitations

Mitigation strategies will be defined and implemented to address these risks.


**12.  Exit Criteria**

The requirements management process will be considered complete when:

*   All requirements have been elicited, analyzed, and documented.
*   All requirements have been verified and validated.
*   The RTM is complete and up-to-date.
*   Stakeholders have approved the requirements.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The project's iterative nature and use of AI will allow for continuous improvement and adaptation of this plan.
