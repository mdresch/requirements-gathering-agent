# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This plan details how requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, validated, and managed throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of ADPA is to automate the generation of comprehensive and accurate project management documentation, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Specific objectives include:

*   Generating a complete suite of PMBOK documents from a project's README and associated documentation.
*   Supporting multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Implementing a robust context management system to maximize AI model performance.
*   Providing a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
*   Ensuring PMBOK 7.0 compliance and providing validation reports.
*   Maintaining a modular architecture for future extensibility.
*   Implementing a version control system for generated documents.


**3. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis**

Requirements will be elicited from multiple sources:

*   **Project Stakeholder Interviews:**  Discussions with project managers, business analysts, and developers to understand their needs and expectations.
*   **Document Review:** Analysis of existing project documentation (README.md, architecture diagrams, requirements specifications, etc.).
*   **Market Research:**  Review of competitor products and industry best practices.
*   **User Feedback:** Gathering feedback from early adopters and beta testers.

Analysis will involve:

*   **Prioritization:** Ranking requirements based on importance and feasibility.
*   **Decomposition:** Breaking down high-level requirements into smaller, manageable tasks.
*   **Validation:** Ensuring requirements are clear, concise, unambiguous, and testable.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Addressing any conflicts or inconsistencies between requirements.


**4. Requirements Documentation**

Requirements will be documented using a combination of techniques:

*   **User Stories:**  Short, simple descriptions of features from the user's perspective.
*   **Use Cases:**  Detailed descriptions of how users interact with the system.
*   **Requirements Specification Document:**  A formal document outlining all functional and non-functional requirements.  This will utilize a structured format (e.g., a table with ID, description, priority, source, status, etc.).
*   **Data Dictionary:**  Definitions of key terms and data elements.

**5. Requirements Traceability**

A traceability matrix will be maintained to link requirements to design elements, test cases, and other project artifacts.  This ensures that all requirements are addressed and that changes to requirements are properly tracked.

**6. Requirements Validation and Verification**

Requirements validation will be performed throughout the development process through:

*   **Reviews:** Formal reviews of requirements documents by stakeholders.
*   **Prototyping:** Creating prototypes to demonstrate and validate requirements.
*   **Testing:**  Unit, integration, and system testing to verify that the system meets requirements.

**7. Requirements Change Management**

A formal change management process will be implemented to handle any changes to requirements.  This process will include:

*   **Change Request Submission:**  A formal process for submitting change requests.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluating the impact of change requests on the project schedule, budget, and scope.
*   **Change Approval:**  Obtaining approval from stakeholders for change requests.
*   **Change Implementation:**  Implementing approved change requests.
*   **Change Communication:**  Communicating change requests and their impact to stakeholders.


**8. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used for requirements management:

*   **Requirements Management Software:**  A dedicated requirements management tool (e.g., Jira, Confluence) may be used to track and manage requirements.
*   **Version Control System:** Git will be used to manage the requirements documents and track changes.
*   **Traceability Matrix:** A spreadsheet or dedicated tool will be used to track traceability.
*   **Project Management Software:**  A project management tool (e.g., Asana, Trello) will be used for overall project tracking.


**9. Roles and Responsibilities**

*   **Requirements Engineer:** Responsible for eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating requirements.
*   **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project management and approval of change requests.
*   **Developers:** Responsible for implementing requirements.
*   **Testers:** Responsible for verifying that the system meets requirements.
*   **Stakeholders:**  Provide input on requirements and approve change requests.


**10.  Metrics and Reporting**

The following metrics will be tracked and reported:

*   Number of requirements elicited.
*   Number of requirements validated.
*   Number of change requests submitted.
*   Number of change requests approved.
*   Time spent on requirements management activities.

Regular reports will be provided to stakeholders on the status of requirements management.


**11.  Acceptance Criteria**

The following criteria must be met for the requirements to be considered accepted:

*   All requirements are documented in the requirements specification document.
*   All requirements are validated and verified through testing.
*   All requirements are traceable to design elements and test cases.
*   Stakeholders have approved all requirements.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The plan's effectiveness will be assessed through regular monitoring and feedback from stakeholders.
