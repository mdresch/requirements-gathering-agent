## Quality Metrics Framework: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) Project

This document outlines the quality metrics framework for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The framework focuses on measuring the quality of the development process, the resulting product, and customer satisfaction.  Given the project's focus on generating PMBOK-compliant documents and integrating with multiple AI providers, metrics related to accuracy, completeness, and performance are prioritized.  The absence of explicit security requirements in the provided context is noted; however, basic security aspects (e.g., API key handling) will be monitored.  Future iterations may incorporate more stringent security metrics.

**1. Quality Metrics Overview**

* **Purpose and Objectives:** To ensure the RGA delivers high-quality, reliable, and user-friendly PMBOK documentation generation capabilities, meeting stakeholder expectations and achieving project goals.
* **Metrics Framework and Methodology:**  A multi-faceted approach combining process metrics, product metrics, defect metrics, and customer metrics.  Data will be collected using automated tools (e.g., SonarQube, test automation frameworks) and manual inspections.
* **Quality Goals and Targets:**  Defined for each metric in Section 2-5.  Overall, the aim is to achieve a defect density below 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code, a customer satisfaction score above 4.5 out of 5, and 99.9% system uptime after release.
* **Stakeholder Expectations and Success Criteria:** Successful project delivery will be measured by achieving the defined quality goals, positive user feedback, timely delivery, and successful integration with target systems (SharePoint, Confluence).

**6. Quality Reporting and Dashboards**

* **Metrics Collection Methods:** Automated data collection from SonarQube, test automation frameworks, and defect tracking system. Manual data collection for user acceptance testing and customer surveys.  APIs will be used where possible to integrate tools. Data validation rules will be implemented to ensure accuracy.
* **Reporting Framework:**  A dashboard will be created to visualize key KPIs (e.g., defect density, test coverage, customer satisfaction). Reports will be generated weekly and monthly, highlighting trends and areas for improvement.  Action items will be tracked within the project management tool.

**7. Quality Improvement Actions**

* **Threshold Management:**  Predefined thresholds will trigger escalation procedures.  For example, if defect density exceeds 0.7, a code review process improvement initiative will be launched.  Continuous improvement processes (e.g., retrospectives) will be employed to address recurring issues.
* **Metrics Analysis:**  Regular analysis of metrics will identify trends and pinpoint areas needing improvement. Root cause analysis will be performed for major defects or performance issues.  Improvements will be validated by measuring the impact on relevant metrics.


This framework provides a foundation for managing and improving the quality of the RGA project.  It will be iteratively refined based on project progress and feedback.  The specific targets and thresholds will be further defined and agreed upon with stakeholders during the project planning phase.  The focus will remain on delivering a high-quality product that meets the needs of its users and adheres to PMBOK best practices.
