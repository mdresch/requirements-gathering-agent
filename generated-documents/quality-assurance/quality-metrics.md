## Quality Metrics Framework for ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant)

This document defines the quality metrics framework for the ADPA project, focusing on measuring the quality of both the development process and the generated documentation.

### 1. Quality Metrics Overview

**Purpose and Objectives:** To establish a robust quality assurance process, ensuring ADPA delivers high-quality, accurate, and PMBOK-compliant documentation,  meeting stakeholder expectations and achieving project success.  The metrics will drive continuous improvement and identify areas needing attention.

**Metrics Framework and Methodology:**  We will employ a multi-faceted approach, tracking metrics across development processes, product quality, defect management, and customer satisfaction.  Data will be collected using automated tools where possible, supplemented by manual checks.  Statistical process control (SPC) charts will be used to monitor trends and identify anomalies.

**Quality Goals and Targets:**

* **Defect Density:**  Less than 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code (LOC) by release.
* **Test Coverage:** 95% code coverage for unit tests and 80% for integration tests by release.
* **User Satisfaction:**  Average customer satisfaction score (CSAT) of 4.5 out of 5 (based on post-release surveys).
* **Document Accuracy:**  98% accuracy of generated PMBOK documents (verified through manual review and automated checks).
* **PMBOK Compliance:** 100% compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards for all generated documents.
* **Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR):**  Average time to resolve a production issue should be under 2 hours.
* **System Uptime:**  99.9% system availability.


**Stakeholder Expectations and Success Criteria:**

* **Development Team:**  On-time delivery of high-quality code with minimal defects.
* **Product Owner:**  High user satisfaction, accurate and timely document generation.
* **Customers:**  Accurate, comprehensive, and PMBOK-compliant documentation that meets their needs.

* **Trend Analysis and Insights:**  Regular trend analysis to identify improvement areas and potential risks.
* **Action Item Tracking:**  Tracking of action items identified based on metric analysis and reporting.


### 7. Quality Improvement Actions

**Threshold Management:**

* **Quality Gates and Criteria:**  Defined thresholds for key metrics (e.g., defect density, test coverage) that trigger corrective actions.
* **Escalation Procedures:**  Clear escalation procedures for issues that exceed defined thresholds.
* **Corrective Action Triggers:**  Predefined corrective actions based on specific metric breaches.
* **Continuous Improvement Processes:**  Regular reviews of quality metrics and processes to identify areas for improvement.

**Metrics Analysis:**

* **Trend Identification and Analysis:**  Regular analysis of metric trends to identify patterns and potential issues.
* **Root Cause Investigation:**  Thorough investigation of root causes for identified issues.
* **Improvement Opportunity Identification:**  Identification of opportunities for improvement based on metric analysis and root cause investigations.

This framework provides a comprehensive approach to quality management for the ADPA project.  Regular monitoring and analysis of these metrics will be crucial for ensuring the project's success and delivering high-quality documentation to our customers.  The specific targets and thresholds will be refined based on initial data and ongoing performance.
