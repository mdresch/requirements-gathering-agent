## Security Testing Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Security Testing Overview**

**1.1 Objectives and Goals:**  The primary objective is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities within the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) application and its associated APIs, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and industry best practices.  This includes protecting sensitive data (API keys, user credentials, generated documents potentially containing sensitive project information), preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring the system's resilience against attacks.

**1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**

* **Threats:** Unauthorized access to APIs, data breaches, injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection), denial-of-service attacks,  credential stuffing, session hijacking, insecure configuration, supply chain vulnerabilities (dependencies), and social engineering attacks targeting developers or users.
* **Vulnerabilities:**  Insecure authentication mechanisms, insufficient input validation, lack of output encoding, insecure data storage, missing security headers (e.g., CSP, HSTS), weak encryption, outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities, lack of logging and monitoring, and insufficient access controls.
* **Assets:**  API keys, user credentials, generated documents (potentially containing sensitive project information), source code, database, and the application itself.

**1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards:**

Given the project's aim for an international footprint and use in the banking industry, compliance with several regulations and standards is critical:

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  If the RGA handles any personally identifiable information (PII), GDPR compliance is mandatory, requiring robust data protection measures.
* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):**  If the RGA processes or stores payment card data, PCI DSS compliance is required.  This is unlikely given the project description, but needs clarification.
* **Other Relevant Regulations:**  Specific regional regulations may apply depending on where the application is deployed and used.  This needs further investigation based on target deployment locations.
* **OWASP Top 10:**  Addressing the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities is crucial for web application security.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  Alignment with the NIST framework provides a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management.
* **ISO 27001:**  Implementing an ISO 27001-compliant Information Security Management System (ISMS) is recommended for a robust security posture.

**1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**

This security testing plan covers the RGA application, its APIs, and its dependencies.  It will focus on the identified threats and vulnerabilities.  Testing will be conducted in a dedicated testing environment.  Limitations include the availability of test data and the scope of penetration testing (limited to identified attack vectors).  Third-party libraries will be assessed for known vulnerabilities but a full audit of the open-source supply chain is outside the scope unless deemed critical.


**2. Security Test Strategy**

The testing strategy will employ a combination of automated and manual techniques:

* **Authentication Testing:** Verify the strength and security of API key authentication and JWT (JSON Web Token) mechanisms. Test against brute-force attacks, replay attacks, and session hijacking.
* **Authorization Testing:** Validate access control mechanisms to ensure that users and systems only access authorized resources.  Test for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation Testing:**  Thoroughly test input validation to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection, LDAP injection).
* **Data Protection Testing:** Verify data encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.  Assess compliance with data privacy regulations (GDPR).
* **Network Security Testing:**  Analyze network communication security, firewall rules, and potential network vulnerabilities.
* **Application Security Testing:**  Perform static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) to identify code vulnerabilities.
* **Third-Party Library Assessment:** Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check.


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scanning using Nessus, QualysGuard, or OpenVAS to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess the impact.  This will include black-box, grey-box, and potentially white-box testing depending on available information and time constraints.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual review of source code to identify security flaws.  Automated tools like SonarQube and Checkmarx will also be used.
* **Configuration Testing:**  Verify secure configurations of servers, databases, and other components.
* **Compliance Testing:**  Verify compliance with identified regulations and standards.
* **Social Engineering Testing:**  Simulate phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques to assess the resilience of the system against human error.


**4. Security Test Scenarios**

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks against API keys and JWTs, credential stuffing, session hijacking (using tools like Burp Suite).
* **Authorization Bypass:** Attempting to access unauthorized resources through various methods, including exploiting flaws in access control lists.
* **Injection Attacks:**  Testing for SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and LDAP injection using both automated tools (OWASP ZAP) and manual techniques.
* **Data Exposure:**  Attempting to access sensitive data through various attack vectors.
* **Denial of Service:**  Simulating DDoS attacks at the application and network layers.
* **Cryptographic Failures:**  Testing the strength of encryption algorithms and key management practices.
* **API Security Testing:**  Testing API endpoints for common API vulnerabilities (OWASP API Security Top 10).


**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, QualysGuard, OpenVAS
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
* **Dependency Checkers:** Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check
* **API Testing Tools:** Postman, Insomnia


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated isolated testing environment mirroring the production environment will be used.  This will include separate databases, servers, and networks.  Test data will be anonymized or synthetically generated to prevent data breaches.  Network segmentation and security controls will be implemented to isolate the testing environment.  Comprehensive logging and monitoring will track all testing activities.


**7. Security Test Execution**

Testing will be conducted in phases, with each phase documented and reviewed.  Vulnerabilities will be classified based on severity (critical, high, medium, low).  A security incident response plan will be in place to handle any unexpected issues.  Remediation efforts will be tracked and validated.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards (Detailed)**

* **GDPR:**  Data minimization, purpose limitation, data security, subject access requests, data breach notification.  Specific measures will be defined based on data processing activities.
* **PCI DSS:**  If applicable (requires clarification), all 12 requirements will be addressed.
* **OWASP Top 10:**  Each vulnerability category will be tested, and remediation plans will be developed for any identified issues.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  The framework will guide the overall security approach, including identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover functions.


**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

Metrics will include the number of vulnerabilities identified, their severity, remediation status, and test coverage.  Regular reports will be generated for stakeholders, including executive summaries and detailed technical reports.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

A prioritized list of vulnerabilities will be created, with remediation timelines and assigned responsibilities.  Security controls will be implemented and validated.  Continuous security monitoring will be implemented using appropriate tools and techniques.  Security awareness training will be provided to developers and other relevant personnel.


**Note:** This plan is a template and needs further refinement based on a more detailed understanding of the RGA architecture, data flows, and specific deployment environment.  A detailed threat model, specific regulatory requirements (based on deployment location), and a defined testing timeline are crucial for successful execution.  This plan also assumes the presence of an existing security incident response plan.
