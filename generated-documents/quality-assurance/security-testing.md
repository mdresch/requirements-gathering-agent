## Security Testing Plan: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

This document outlines a comprehensive security testing plan for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project, encompassing its software, hardware, and network components.  The plan considers the unique security challenges presented by the integration of multiple energy harvesting technologies and an AI-powered energy management unit (EMU).

**1. Security Testing Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:** To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the SCEV system, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and functionality.  This includes protecting user data, preventing unauthorized access and control, and ensuring the reliable operation of the vehicle.

* **Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**  Threats include:
    * **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to user data (driving habits, location, etc.) stored locally or transmitted remotely.
    * **Vehicle manipulation:** Remote or physical attacks to compromise vehicle control systems (braking, acceleration, steering).
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attacks that disrupt the functionality of the EMU or energy harvesting systems.
    * **Software vulnerabilities:** Exploitable flaws in the EMU's software or firmware.
    * **Hardware vulnerabilities:** Physical tampering or attacks targeting the energy harvesting components.
    * **Supply chain attacks:** Compromised components from third-party vendors.
    * **Eavesdropping:** Unauthorized interception of communication between the vehicle and external systems.

* **Compliance Requirements and Standards:**  The SCEV project must comply with relevant automotive security standards (e.g., ISO 21434), data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), and potentially industry-specific standards depending on the regions of operation.

* **Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**  This plan focuses on the security of the EMU software, communication protocols, and the integration of energy harvesting systems.  It does not cover physical security aspects of the vehicle itself beyond the embedded systems.  Testing will be conducted within a controlled environment, and certain limitations may exist due to resource constraints and the availability of test vehicles.


**2. Security Test Strategy**

This plan employs a multi-layered approach combining automated and manual testing techniques.

* **Authentication Testing:** Verification of user authentication mechanisms (if any) for accessing EMU data or configuration.
* **Authorization Testing:** Validation of access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized modification of vehicle settings or data access.
* **Input Validation Testing:**  Robust testing to prevent injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection) targeting the EMU and any external APIs.
* **Data Protection Testing:** Evaluation of data encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring data integrity and compliance with privacy regulations.
* **Network Security Testing:** Assessment of communication protocols (e.g., CAN bus, wireless communication) for vulnerabilities.
* **Application Security Testing:** Comprehensive testing of the EMU software for vulnerabilities using static and dynamic analysis.


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scanning using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys to identify known vulnerabilities in the software and network components.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing to simulate real-world attacks, attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess their impact.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual review of source code for the EMU and other critical software components to identify security flaws.
* **Configuration Testing:** Verification of secure default configurations for all software and hardware components.
* **Compliance Testing:** Validation of compliance with relevant security standards and regulations using appropriate tools and checklists.
* **Fuzzing:**  Inputting random or unexpected data to expose vulnerabilities in the software's handling of input.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Examining the software's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.


**4. Security Test Scenarios**

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking attempts (if applicable).
* **Authorization Bypass:** Attempts to escalate privileges or access restricted functionality.
* **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, XSS, command injection, attempts targeting the EMU's communication interfaces and databases.
* **Data Exposure:** Attempts to access sensitive data (user data, vehicle diagnostics) through various attack vectors.
* **Denial of Service:** Attacks targeting the EMU or energy harvesting systems to disrupt their operation.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks:**  Interception of communication between the vehicle and external systems.
* **Side-channel attacks:**  Exploiting timing or power consumption variations to gain information.
* **Replay attacks:**  Reusing captured authentication tokens or commands.
* **Physical attacks:**  Testing the resistance of hardware components to physical tampering.


**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, OWASP ZAP.
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Coverity, Checkmarx.
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
* **Fuzzing Tools:** Radamsa, AFL.
* **SCA Tools:** Black Duck, Snyk.
* **CAN Bus Analysis Tools:**  Vector CANalyzer, Intrepid RAD-Galaxy.


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated, isolated testing environment will be set up, mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.  This includes emulated energy harvesting systems and network infrastructure.  Test data will be anonymized and handled securely.


**7. Security Test Execution**

Testing will be conducted in phases, starting with vulnerability assessments, followed by penetration testing, and concluding with compliance validation.  A detailed timeline will be established, with regular progress reports and risk assessments.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards**

Compliance with ISO 21434 (Road vehicles â€” Cybersecurity engineering), GDPR, and other relevant regulations will be rigorously assessed.  The OWASP Top 10 and NIST Cybersecurity Framework will guide the testing process.


**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

Key performance indicators (KPIs) will track the number of vulnerabilities discovered, their severity, and the time taken to remediate them.  Regular reports will be generated for stakeholders, summarizing findings and recommendations.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

A prioritized list of vulnerabilities will be created, with remediation plans and timelines.  Continuous security monitoring and improvement will be implemented to address emerging threats.  Security awareness training will be provided to development and operations teams.


This plan provides a starting point and will be iteratively refined throughout the project lifecycle, adapting to new findings and evolving security threats.  The specific tools and methodologies used may be adjusted based on the project's progress and resource availability.
