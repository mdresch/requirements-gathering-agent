## Security Testing Plan for ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**1. Security Testing Overview**

**1.1 Objectives and Goals:**

The primary objective is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities within the ADPA framework, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This includes its CLI, REST API, web interface, integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe), and underlying AI processing.  The goal is to achieve a robust security posture compliant with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, Basel III, MiFID II, FINRA) and industry best practices (OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework).

**1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**

The ADPA framework faces various threats, including:

* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, project documents, and AI model inputs/outputs.
* **API vulnerabilities:** Injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection), authentication bypass, authorization flaws, insecure data handling.
* **Third-party risks:** Vulnerabilities in integrated platforms (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe) or AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).
* **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Overloading the system to make it unavailable.
* **Insider threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by authorized personnel.
* **Social engineering:** Manipulating users to divulge sensitive information or grant unauthorized access.


**1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards:**

ADPA must comply with the following regulations and standards:

* **GDPR:**  Data protection and privacy for EU citizens.
* **HIPAA:**  Protection of health information in the US.
* **PCI DSS:**  Security standards for handling credit card information.
* **SOX:**  Financial reporting regulations in the US.
* **Basel III:**  International banking regulations.
* **MiFID II:**  Financial market regulations in Europe.
* **FINRA:**  Financial industry regulations in the US.
* **OWASP Top 10:**  Common web application security risks.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  Framework for managing cybersecurity risk.


**1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**

This plan covers security testing of the ADPA framework's core components (CLI, REST API, web interface, integrations), including authentication, authorization, input validation, data protection, and network security.  Limitations include:

* **Third-party code:**  Testing will focus on the integration points with third-party systems, not the systems themselves.  Security of third-party providers is their responsibility.
* **AI model security:**  Focus will be on secure handling of inputs and outputs to/from the AI models, not on the models' internal security.
* **Physical security:** This plan does not address physical security aspects.


**2. Security Test Strategy**

This plan employs a multi-layered approach combining automated and manual testing techniques:

* **Authentication Testing:** Verify user authentication mechanisms (Entra ID integration, API keys, JWT) against brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and session hijacking.
* **Authorization Testing:** Validate access control mechanisms (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users can access specific functionalities and data.
* **Input Validation Testing:**  Assess protection against injection attacks (SQLi, XSS, command injection, LDAP injection) and other malicious inputs.
* **Data Protection Testing:** Verify encryption, data integrity, and privacy measures for sensitive data (PII, financial information, etc.) at rest and in transit.
* **Network Security Testing:** Evaluate network security configurations, firewall rules, and protection against network attacks.
* **Application Security Testing:**  Identify and assess code vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) using static and dynamic analysis.


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scans using Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS, and OWASP ZAP to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess the impact.  Metasploit, Burp Suite, Nmap, and Wireshark will be used.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual and automated static analysis of source code using SonarQube Security, Checkmarx, or Veracode to identify security flaws.
* **Configuration Testing:** Verify secure configurations of servers, databases, and network devices.
* **Compliance Testing:**  Assess compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, etc., using relevant compliance scanning tools.
* **Social Engineering Testing:** Simulate phishing attacks and other social engineering techniques to assess human vulnerability.


**4. Security Test Scenarios**

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, replay attacks.
* **Authorization Bypass:** Privilege escalation, access control circumvention, unauthorized data access.
* **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, XSS, command injection, LDAP injection, XML External Entities (XXE).
* **Data Exposure:**  Sensitive data leakage through insecure APIs, misconfigurations, or inadequate access controls.
* **Denial of Service:**  Application-layer and network-layer DoS attacks.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Exploiting user sessions to perform unauthorized actions.
* **Broken Authentication:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms.
* **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Identifying vulnerabilities leading to exposure of sensitive information.
* **Cryptographic Failures:** Weak encryption algorithms, insecure key management.
* **API Security Flaws:** Testing API endpoints for vulnerabilities such as rate limiting bypass, improper input handling, and lack of authentication/authorization.
* **Integration Vulnerabilities:** Testing the security of integrations with Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services.


**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, QualysGuard, OpenVAS, OWASP ZAP
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
* **Compliance Scanners:** Tools specific to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX (e.g., various commercial scanners).
* **API Testing Tools:** Postman, REST-assured


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated isolated test environment mirroring the production environment will be used.  Test data will be anonymized or synthetic.  Network segmentation will isolate the test environment from production.  All testing activities will be monitored and logged.


**7. Security Test Execution**

The testing will follow a phased approach:

* **Phase 1:** Vulnerability Assessment (automated scans).
* **Phase 2:** Penetration Testing (manual exploitation of vulnerabilities).
* **Phase 3:** Security Code Review (static analysis).
* **Phase 4:** Configuration Testing.
* **Phase 5:** Compliance Testing.
* **Phase 6:** Social Engineering Testing (if applicable).

Each phase will have a defined timeline and deliverables.  Vulnerabilities will be classified based on severity (critical, high, medium, low).  A security incident response plan will be in place to handle any unforeseen issues.  Remediation will be tracked and validated.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards** (As already detailed in Section 1.3)


**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

Metrics will include:

* Number of vulnerabilities identified and their severity.
* Time to remediation.
* Test coverage.
* Compliance status.

Reports will be generated for both technical and executive audiences.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

A prioritized list of vulnerabilities will be created, with remediation timelines and assigned responsibilities.  Security controls will be implemented and validated.  Continuous security monitoring will be implemented to identify and address emerging threats.  Security awareness training will be provided to developers and other relevant personnel.


This plan provides a comprehensive framework for security testing of the ADPA framework.  Specific details of the testing process, timelines, and resources will be further elaborated in subsequent project documentation.
