## Security Testing Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Security Testing Overview**

**1.1 Objectives and Goals:**  The primary objective is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities within the ADPA application, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and system resources.  Specific goals include:

* Identifying vulnerabilities related to authentication, authorization, data protection, and input validation.
* Assessing the resilience of ADPA against common attack vectors (e.g., injection attacks, denial-of-service).
* Validating compliance with relevant security standards and regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc., depending on data handling).
* Providing recommendations for remediation and security hardening.

**1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**  ADPA handles sensitive user data (API keys, potentially project-specific confidential information) and interacts with external AI services.  Key threats include:

* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to API keys, project data, and user credentials.
* **Data leakage:** Accidental or malicious disclosure of sensitive information.
* **Injection attacks:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in input validation to execute malicious code.
* **Denial-of-service:**  Overloading the system to disrupt service availability.
* **API key compromise:** Unauthorized use of API keys to access AI services.
* **Supply chain attacks:** Vulnerabilities in dependent libraries or AI providers.

**1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards:**  Compliance requirements will depend on the specific data ADPA handles and its deployment environment.  However, minimum standards should include:

* **OWASP Top 10:**  Addressing the top 10 web application security risks.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  Implementing appropriate security controls based on the framework's five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
* **GDPR (if applicable):**  Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation regarding user data.
* **CCPA (if applicable):** Compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act.
* **Other relevant regulations:**  Depending on data handling and location.


**1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**  This plan covers security testing of the ADPA application itself, including its CLI, API interactions, and internal components.  It does *not* cover:

* The security of the underlying AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).  This is the responsibility of those providers.
* The security of user systems or networks where ADPA is deployed.
* Social engineering attacks against users (this should be addressed through separate security awareness training).


**2. Security Test Strategy**

The testing approach will be a combination of automated and manual techniques, incorporating vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews.

* **Authentication Testing:**  Verify the robustness of API key handling and any user authentication mechanisms (if implemented).  Test scenarios will include brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and session hijacking.
* **Authorization Testing:**  Validate that users only have access to the resources and functionalities they are authorized to use.  Test scenarios will include privilege escalation attempts and unauthorized access attempts.
* **Input Validation Testing:**  Thoroughly test the input validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection).  Fuzzing techniques will be employed to identify unexpected input handling.
* **Data Protection Testing:**  Verify that sensitive data (API keys, user data if applicable) is appropriately encrypted both in transit and at rest.  Test for data integrity and availability.
* **Network Security Testing:**  Analyze network traffic and configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities.  Port scanning and network mapping will be performed.
* **Application Security Testing:**  Conduct static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) to identify vulnerabilities in the application code.


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scanning using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and Qualys to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess the impact.  This will include both black-box and white-box testing approaches.
* **Security Code Review:**  Manual inspection of source code to identify potential security flaws.  This will focus on areas related to authentication, authorization, input validation, and data handling.
* **Configuration Testing:**  Review and validate the security configuration of the application and its dependencies.  This includes checking for default passwords, weak encryption settings, and insecure configurations.
* **Compliance Testing:**  Verify compliance with identified security standards and regulations.  This may involve using specialized compliance scanners.


**4. Security Test Scenarios**

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, replay attacks against API keys.
* **Authorization Bypass:**  Attempting to access unauthorized resources through various methods (e.g., manipulating URLs, exploiting session tokens).
* **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, LDAP injection (if applicable).  This will involve injecting malicious code into various input fields.
* **Data Exposure:**  Attempting to access sensitive data through various means (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities, manipulating API calls).
* **Denial of Service:**  Attempting to overload the application with requests to disrupt service availability.
* **Cryptographic Failures:**  Analyzing encryption algorithms and key management practices to identify weaknesses.
* **API Key Exploitation:**  Attempting to use stolen or compromised API keys to access AI services.
* **Broken Authentication:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.


**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, OWASP ZAP.
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode.
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
* **Compliance Scanners:**  Tools specific to GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS (if applicable).


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated, isolated security testing environment will be created that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible.  This will include:

* Separate network segmentation.
* Mock data to prevent exposure of real user information.
* Monitoring and logging capabilities to track testing activities.


**7. Security Test Execution**

Testing will be conducted in phases, starting with vulnerability assessments and progressing to penetration testing and code reviews.  A detailed timeline will be established.  Results will be analyzed, vulnerabilities classified (CVSS scoring), and prioritized for remediation.  An incident response plan will be in place to handle any unexpected security incidents during testing.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards (Expanded)**

The specific compliance requirements will depend on the data ADPA handles and its deployment location.  However, the following standards should be considered:

* **GDPR:**  Data subject access requests, data minimization, data security, and breach notification requirements.
* **CCPA:**  Data subject rights, data minimization, and data security.
* **NIST SP 800-53:**  Security and privacy controls for information systems and organizations.
* **ISO 27001:**  Information security management system (ISMS) standard.
* **SOC 2 (if applicable):**  Security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.
* **PCI DSS (if applicable):**  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (if handling payment information).


**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include:

* Number of vulnerabilities identified.
* Severity of identified vulnerabilities (CVSS scores).
* Time to remediation.
* Test coverage.
* Compliance status.

Regular reports will be generated summarizing the testing activities, findings, and remediation progress.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

A prioritized list of vulnerabilities will be provided with recommended remediation steps and timelines.  Implementation of security controls will be validated through retesting.  Continuous security monitoring will be recommended to identify and address emerging threats.  Security awareness training for developers and users will be advised.


This detailed plan provides a comprehensive approach to security testing for ADPA.  The specific tools, methodologies, and compliance requirements may need to be adjusted based on the final project scope and data handling practices.
