# Security Testing Plan
## === PROJECT README ===
Let's brainstorm a completely different and ambitious project: "Self-Charging Electric Vehicles" (SCEV).

This is a fascinating concept that tackles one of the biggest hurdles for electric vehicle adoption. Here's a breakdown of the idea.

Project Idea: The "Perpetual Motion" EV
1. The Elevator Pitch

We are developing a new class of electric vehicles that significantly reduce the need to plug in by harvesting ambient energy from their environment. By integrating advanced solar, kinetic, and thermal energy recovery systems, the vehicle constantly "trickle-charges" itself during driving and even while parked, dramatically extending its effective range and reducing reliance on traditional charging infrastructure.

2. The Problem It Solves

Range Anxiety: The single biggest fear for potential EV buyers. Our system directly counters this by continuously adding miles back to the battery.
Charging Infrastructure Gaps: In many urban and rural areas, reliable public charging is scarce. This project makes EVs viable for a much wider audience.
Grid Strain: A massive influx of EVs will put an enormous strain on the electrical grid. Self-charging vehicles lessen this load by generating a portion of their own power.
Cost and Inconvenience: Reduces the time and money spent at charging stations and the hassle of installing a home charger.
3. Core Technologies to Integrate

This isn't about a single solution, but a holistic system of multiple energy-harvesting technologies managed by a central AI.

1. Advanced Photovoltaic Body Panels:

Concept: Instead of a simple solar roof, the car's entire body—hood, roof, trunk, and even doors—is constructed from a lightweight, durable composite material with integrated, high-efficiency solar cells.
Innovation: Using new perovskite or multi-junction solar cells that are more efficient, flexible, and perform better in low-light conditions than traditional silicon.
2. Regenerative Suspension System:

Concept: Standard regenerative braking captures energy when slowing down. We'll add a system that captures energy from the vertical movement of the suspension.
Innovation: Each shock absorber is replaced with a linear electromagnetic generator. Every bump, pothole, and body roll during a turn generates electricity by moving magnets through coils, turning wasted kinetic energy into usable power.
3. Thermoelectric Generation (TEG):

Concept: Capture waste heat from various sources and convert it into electricity.
Innovation: TEG modules would be placed on the battery pack, electric motors, and radiator. As these components heat up during operation, the temperature difference is used to generate a steady stream of power.
4. AI-Powered Energy Management Unit (EMU):

Concept: The "brain" of the system. It's not enough to just generate power; it must be managed intelligently.
Innovation: The EMU uses machine learning to:
Predict energy generation: It analyzes weather forecasts (sunlight), GPS route data (hills, rough roads), and driving style to predict how much energy can be harvested.
Optimize energy flow: It decides in real-time whether to send harvested energy directly to the motors for immediate use or to the battery for storage, based on the current state of charge and predicted needs.
Provide user feedback: A dashboard shows the driver in real-time how much energy is being generated from each source (solar, kinetic, thermal).
4. First Few Project Milestones

M1: Component Feasibility & Simulation: Research and benchmark the most promising solar, kinetic, and thermoelectric technologies. Create a detailed digital twin of a standard EV to simulate the potential energy gains under various real-world conditions (e.g., a sunny commute in Arizona vs. a bumpy, overcast day in Seattle).
M2: Prototype Development: Build and lab-test a functional prototype of the three core hardware systems: a car hood made of photovoltaic composite, a single regenerative shock absorber, and a TEG unit for a battery pack.
M3: Test Mule Integration: Retrofit an existing electric vehicle (the "test mule") with the prototype hardware. The goal is not full integration, but to mount the systems and collect real-world performance data.
M4: Energy Management Unit (EMU) v1.0: Develop the initial software and hardware for the EMU. In this phase, it will only need to accurately read data from all the new sensors and log it for analysis. Control logic will come in a later milestone.
This project represents a fundamental shift from thinking of an EV as a device that simply consumes power to one that actively participates in its own energy lifecycle.

# How to Get Your Adobe.io Credentials

## Step 1: Access Adobe Developer Console

1. Go to https://developer.adobe.com/console
2. Sign in with your Adobe ID (the same one you use for Adobe Creative Cloud)

## Step 2: Find or Create Your Project

### If you already have a project:
1. Click on your existing project
2. Go to the **Credentials** section

### If you need to create a new project:
1. Click **Create new project**
2. Give it a name like "ADPA Document Processing"
3. Click **Create**

## Step 3: Add Adobe PDF Services API

1. In your project, click **Add API**
2. Find **Adobe PDF Services API** in the list
3. Click **Next**
4. Choose **Server-to-Server** authentication
5. Click **Save configured API**

## Step 4: Get Your Credentials

After adding the API, you'll see your credentials:

### Copy these values to your .env file:

```bash
# From the "Credentials" section in Adobe Developer Console:

ADOBE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_console
ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_from_console  
ADOBE_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_org_id_from_console
```

### Where to find each value:

- **ADOBE_CLIENT_ID**: Listed as "Client ID" in the credentials section
- **ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET**: Listed as "Client Secret" (click "Retrieve client secret")
- **ADOBE_ORGANIZATION_ID**: Listed as "Organization ID" at the top of the console

## Step 5: Test Your Credentials

Run this test to make sure your credentials work:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/ims/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&scope=openid"
```

If successful, you'll get back an access token!

## Step 6: Update Your .env File

1. Open your `.env` file in the ADPA directory
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```bash
ADOBE_CLIENT_ID=abcd1234efgh5678    # Your actual Client ID
ADOBE_CLIEN
