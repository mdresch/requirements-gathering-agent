## Security Testing Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA)

**Project:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


### 1. Security Testing Overview

**1.1 Objectives and Goals:**

* Identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the ADPA application and its dependencies.
* Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, OWASP Top 10).
* Validate the security of authentication, authorization, data protection, and network communication mechanisms.
* Assess the resilience of the application against common attack vectors (injection, cross-site scripting, denial-of-service).
* Provide recommendations for remediation and continuous security improvement.


**1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**

ADPA processes sensitive project data, including potentially confidential business information, and integrates with multiple AI providers.  Key threats include:

* **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to project data stored locally or transmitted during API calls.
* **API vulnerabilities:** Injection attacks, insecure authentication, and data leakage through APIs.
* **Denial-of-service (DoS):** Attacks targeting the application's availability.
* **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in user input handling.
* **Authentication bypass:** Unauthorized access through weak authentication mechanisms.
* **Supply chain risks:** Vulnerabilities in dependent libraries or AI provider services.
* **Insider threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by authorized personnel.


**1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards:**

ADPA must adhere to:

* **OWASP Top 10:** Addressing the most critical web application security risks.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Implementing a risk-based approach to cybersecurity.
* **GDPR (if applicable):** Protecting personal data according to EU regulations.
* **CCPA (if applicable):** Complying with California's consumer privacy law.
* **Relevant industry-specific standards:** Depending on the type of projects using ADPA.


**1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**

This plan covers security testing of the ADPA application itself, including its CLI, API interactions, and internal data handling.  It does *not* include:

* Security testing of the underlying AI provider services (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  We will rely on their security posture and certifications.
* Security testing of client-side applications or integrations using ADPA.
* Physical security aspects of the ADPA deployment environment.


### 2. Security Test Strategy

The security testing will adopt a multi-layered approach combining automated and manual techniques:


**2.1 Authentication Testing:**

* **Methodologies:**  Black box testing, replay attacks, brute-force attempts, credential stuffing simulations.
* **Scenarios:** Testing different authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.) against various attack vectors.
* **Metrics:** Success rate of authentication attempts, time to compromise, detection of failed logins.


**2.2 Authorization Testing:**

* **Methodologies:** White box and black box testing, privilege escalation attempts.
* **Scenarios:** Verifying access control mechanisms, checking for privilege escalation vulnerabilities, and unauthorized access attempts.
* **Metrics:** Number of successful authorization bypass attempts, unauthorized access attempts.


**2.3 Input Validation Testing:**

* **Methodologies:** Fuzz testing, injection attacks.
* **Scenarios:** Testing for vulnerabilities to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and other injection attacks.
* **Metrics:** Number of successful injection attempts, effectiveness of input sanitization mechanisms.


**2.4 Data Protection Testing:**

* **Methodologies:** Static and dynamic analysis, review of encryption algorithms and key management practices.
* **Scenarios:** Assessing data encryption at rest and in transit, evaluating data integrity mechanisms, and testing for data leakage vulnerabilities.
* **Metrics:** Strength of encryption algorithms, effectiveness of data integrity checks, detection of data leaks.


**2.5 Network Security Testing:**

* **Methodologies:** Network scanning, penetration testing.
* **Scenarios:** Identifying network vulnerabilities, assessing firewall effectiveness, and testing for denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
* **Metrics:** Number of identified network vulnerabilities, effectiveness of security controls against DoS attacks.


**2.6 Application Security Testing:**

* **Methodologies:** Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA).
* **Scenarios:** Identifying code vulnerabilities (e.g., insecure coding practices), assessing application-level security weaknesses, and verifying the security of third-party components.
* **Metrics:** Number of vulnerabilities found, severity of vulnerabilities, remediation effort.


### 3. Security Test Types and Methodologies

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scans using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing simulating real-world attacks using tools like Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual inspection of source code for security flaws.
* **Configuration Testing:** Review and hardening of server and application configurations.
* **Compliance Testing:** Verification of adherence to relevant security standards and regulations.
* **Social Engineering Testing (limited scope):**  Simulating phishing attempts to assess employee awareness (only with explicit consent and within ethical boundaries).


### 4. Security Test Scenarios (Examples)

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks against API keys and OAuth tokens, credential stuffing, session hijacking.
* **Authorization Bypass:** Attempts to escalate privileges, access unauthorized data or functionalities.
* **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, XSS, command injection attacks targeting the CLI and APIs.
* **Data Exposure:** Attempts to access sensitive data (project details, API keys) through various methods.
* **Denial of Service:** Flooding the application with requests to test its resilience.
* **Cryptographic Failures:** Analysis of encryption algorithms and key management practices.
* **Broken Authentication:** Testing for vulnerabilities related to session management and password handling.
* **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Identifying any potential exposure of sensitive information (project details, API keys, etc.).
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Testing for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user.


### 5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, OWASP ZAP.
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode.
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
* **SCA Tools:** Snyk, Black Duck.
* **Security Configuration Assessment Tools:**  CIS Benchmarks, Security Onion.


### 6. Security Test Environment

A dedicated, isolated testing environment will be set up, mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.  This includes:

* Separate network segment with appropriate firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
* Replica of the database and other relevant data stores.
* Test data that mimics production data but does not contain sensitive information.


### 7. Security Test Execution

The testing will be conducted in phases:

* **Phase 1:** Vulnerability assessment (automated scans).
* **Phase 2:** Penetration testing (manual exploitation).
* **Phase 3:** Security code review.
* **Phase 4:** Configuration testing.
* **Phase 5:** Compliance testing.
* **Phase 6:** Reporting and remediation recommendations.


A detailed timeline will be established based on the project schedule and resource availability.  Vulnerabilities will be classified according to severity (critical, high, medium, low) using a standardized vulnerability scoring system (e.g., CVSS).


### 8. Security Compliance and Standards (Detailed)

* **Regulatory Compliance:**  GDPR (if applicable, assess data processing activities and ensure compliance), CCPA (if applicable, assess data collection and usage practices).  Specific compliance requirements will be determined based on the geographic location of users and the nature of the data processed.
* **Industry Standards:** OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001 (if applicable).
* **Compliance Validation:** Regular audits and penetration tests to ensure ongoing compliance.  Documentation of security controls, processes, and test results will be maintained.


### 9. Security Metrics and Reporting

Key metrics will be tracked and reported:

* Number of vulnerabilities identified.
* Severity of vulnerabilities.
* Remediation time.
* Test coverage.
* Compliance status.


Regular reports will be generated, summarizing findings and recommendations.  Executive summaries will highlight critical vulnerabilities and their potential impact.


### 10. Security Improvement and Remediation

A prioritized list of vulnerabilities will be provided, along with recommended remediation steps and timelines.  Remediation efforts will be tracked and verified through retesting.  Continuous monitoring and security awareness training will be recommended.


This Security Testing Plan provides a framework for a comprehensive security assessment of ADPA.  The specific details of the testing process will be refined based on the ongoing development and deployment of the application.
