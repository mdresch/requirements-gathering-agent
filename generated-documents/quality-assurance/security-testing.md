## Security Testing Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Security Testing Overview**

**1.1 Objectives and Goals:**  The primary objective is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities within the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA RGA) application and its associated infrastructure. This includes validating the security of the API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, data handling processes, and overall system architecture.  The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data, meeting regulatory compliance standards.

**1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**

* **Threats:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints (data breaches, manipulation of generated documents), denial-of-service attacks, injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection),  credential stuffing, session hijacking, data leakage (sensitive stakeholder information, regulatory data), insecure configuration, insider threats.
* **Vulnerabilities:** Weak authentication mechanisms, insufficient input validation, insecure storage of API keys and sensitive data, lack of rate limiting, outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities, insecure network configuration, absence of proper logging and monitoring.
* **Assets:** API endpoints, databases (if any), generated documents, user credentials,  source code, configuration files, infrastructure components (servers, networks).

**1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards:**

The project README mentions several relevant regulations:  GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, and Basel III, MiFID II. Compliance will vary based on the specific data handled and client requirements.  The testing plan must address relevant subsets of these standards.  OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, ISO 27001, and CIS Controls will also guide the testing.

**1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**

* **In Scope:**  The API endpoints, authentication mechanisms, data handling (including the processing of input data and generation of output documents),  database interactions (if applicable), and deployment infrastructure.
* **Out of Scope:**  Third-party libraries (unless critical vulnerabilities are discovered), client-side applications (if any), physical security of servers (assumed to be handled by the hosting provider).  Specific compliance requirements will be defined based on client contracts.


**2. Security Test Strategy**

The testing approach will combine automated and manual techniques:

* **Authentication Testing:**  Verify API key authentication, JWT validation (if used), and robustness against brute-force, credential stuffing, and session hijacking attacks.
* **Authorization Testing:** Validate access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access specific functionalities and data.  Verify role-based access control (RBAC) implementation (if applicable).
* **Input Validation Testing:**  Thoroughly test input validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection), and other malicious input.
* **Data Protection Testing:** Assess encryption methods used for sensitive data (at rest and in transit). Verify data integrity mechanisms and compliance with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA).
* **Network Security Testing:**  Perform network vulnerability scans to identify potential weaknesses in the infrastructure.  Assess network segmentation and security controls.
* **Application Security Testing:** Conduct both static and dynamic application security testing (SAST/DAST) to identify code vulnerabilities and security weaknesses in the application code.


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scans using Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS, and OWASP ZAP to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing to attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess the impact of successful attacks.  This will involve various attack vectors including those listed in Section 4.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual review of the source code to identify potential security flaws (OWASP Top 10).  Utilize SonarQube Security or similar static analysis tools.
* **Configuration Testing:**  Review and harden server configurations to ensure adherence to security best practices.
* **Compliance Testing:** Verify compliance with relevant regulations and standards using specialized tools and manual checks.
* **Social Engineering Testing (limited scope):** Simulate phishing attacks or other social engineering attempts to assess the resilience of the system to human-based attacks.


**4. Security Test Scenarios**

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, replay attacks (if applicable), weak password attacks.
* **Authorization Bypass:** Attempts to access unauthorized resources through privilege escalation, exploiting vulnerabilities in access control mechanisms, manipulating session IDs.
* **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, LDAP injection,  XML External Entities (XXE) attacks.
* **Data Exposure:** Attempts to access sensitive data through insecure APIs or misconfigurations.  Verify data masking and anonymization techniques.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Simulate various DoS attacks to assess the system's resilience.
* **Cryptographic Failures:** Assess the strength of encryption algorithms used and key management practices.  Look for weak or outdated ciphers.
* **API Security Testing:**  Test for broken authentication, insecure design, excessive data exposure, and lack of rate limiting.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Test for vulnerabilities that allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user without their knowledge.

**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, QualysGuard, OpenVAS, OWASP ZAP.
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode.
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
* **Compliance Scanners:**  Tools specific to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX (if applicable).


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated, isolated test environment will be created, mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.  This includes replicating database schemas and relevant data (using anonymized or sanitized test data).  Network segmentation will be implemented to isolate the test environment from production.


**7. Security Test Execution**

The testing will be conducted in phases, starting with vulnerability assessments, followed by penetration testing, and concluding with compliance checks.  A detailed timeline will be established. Vulnerability findings will be classified according to severity and prioritized for remediation.  A robust incident response plan will be in place to handle any unforeseen security incidents during testing.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards (Specific to Context)**

This project requires a rigorous approach to compliance due to the sensitivity of the data processed (Fortune 500 financial data). The testing will focus on:

* **GDPR:** Data subject access rights, data minimization, data security, and notification requirements.
* **SOX:**  Data integrity, financial reporting accuracy, and audit trail requirements.
* **HIPAA (if applicable):**  Protected health information (PHI) security and privacy rules.
* **PCI DSS (if applicable):**  Payment card data security standards.
* **Basel III/MiFID II (if applicable):**  Financial regulations related to data security and reporting.
* **OWASP Top 10:**  Address the most critical web application security risks.


**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

Metrics will include the number of vulnerabilities identified, their severity, remediation status, and overall security posture.  Regular reports will be generated, including executive summaries highlighting key findings and recommendations.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

Prioritized vulnerability remediation will be tracked using a dedicated issue tracking system.  Security controls will be implemented and validated.  Continuous security monitoring will be recommended post-testing, including regular vulnerability scans and security audits.  Security awareness training for developers and other relevant personnel will be recommended.


This Security Testing Plan provides a framework.  Specific details, such as the exact compliance requirements, tools used, and testing timeline, will be refined based on further discussions with stakeholders and a more detailed understanding of the system's architecture and data handling processes.  The plan will be iteratively updated as the project progresses.
