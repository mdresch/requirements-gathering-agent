## 1. Security Testing Overview

### 1.1 Security Testing Objectives and Goals
- **Protect Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability** of all components (CLI, REST API, Admin Web, integrations).
- **Identify and remediate vulnerabilities** in authentication, authorization, input validation, data storage, and integrations (Adobe, SharePoint, Confluence, AI Providers).
- **Ensure regulatory and standards compliance** (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, ISO 27001, OWASP).
- **Enable secure enterprise deployments** for Fortune 500 and regulated industries.

### 1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling
- **Attack Surfaces**:
  - Public REST API endpoints (Express.js, OpenAPI).
  - CLI and Admin Web Interface.
  - Integration points (Adobe APIs, SharePoint, Confluence, AI providers).
  - OAuth2/SAML/Active Directory-based identity management.
  - Document generation (input/output handling, template injection).
  - Data persistence (configuration files, logs, generated documents, secrets).
- **Threats Identified**:
  - API abuse (rate limiting bypass, unauthorized access).
  - Credential theft, privilege escalation, session hijacking.
  - Injection attacks (SQL/NoSQL, Command, XSS, Template Injection).
  - Sensitive data exposure (PII, API keys in logs, document leaks).
  - Supply chain attacks via dependencies or provider compromise.
  - Insider threats (malicious admins, privilege misuse).
  - Denial of Service (DoS) and resource exhaustion.
  - Weak cryptography and poor key management.
  - Compliance violations (data residency, audit trail gaps).

### 1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards
- **Regulatory:** GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI DSS, FINRA, Basel III, MiFID II.
- **Industry Standards:** OWASP Top 10, NIST CSF, ISO 27001, CIS Controls, SANS Top 25.
- **Framework Compliance:** BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th, DMBOK 2.0.

### 1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations
- **In Scope:**
  - All user-facing APIs, CLI, Web UI.
  - Authentication/authorization flows (API keys, JWT, OAuth2, SAML, AD).
  - Integrations (Adobe, SharePoint, Confluence, AI providers).
  - Document processing pipeline (uploads, template generation).
  - Configuration and data storage (including .env, secrets).
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Third-party provider infrastructure (OpenAI, Google AI, Adobe, etc.).
  - Underlying platform security (Node.js/OS hardening) except where misconfiguration impacts ADPA.

## 2. Security Test Strategy

### 2.1 Authentication Testing
- **Objective:** Validate identity management (API Key, JWT, OAuth2, SAML, AD).
- Test session management: token expiry, revocation, refresh flows.
- MFA/2FA enforcement (where applicable).
- Test for credential stuffing, brute force, default credentials.

### 2.2 Authorization Testing
- **Objective:** Ensure strict role-based and permission-based access control.
- Test all user roles (admin, project_manager, analyst, stakeholder, viewer).
- Attempt privilege escalation, horizontal/vertical access bypass.
- Validate resource ownership and team boundary enforcement.

### 2.3 Input Validation Testing
- **Objective:** Prevent injection and malformed data attacks.
- Test all endpoints for SQL/NoSQL injection, XSS, command injection, template injection.
- Fuzz input fields for REST API, CLI arguments, file uploads.
- Validate content-type, size, and structure of uploaded documents and templates.

### 2.4 Data Protection Testing
- **Objective:** Ensure encryption, integrity, and privacy.
- Test encryption for data at rest (config, secrets, documents) and in transit (HTTPS, API calls).
- Inspect logging for sensitive data leakage (PII, tokens, passwords).
- Test document output for unintentional metadata or PII exposure.

### 2.5 Network Security Testing
- **Objective:** Protect against network-based attacks.
- Validate HTTPS/TLS enforcement, secure headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame).
- Scan for open/unused ports, misconfigured CORS, rate limit evasion.
- Test public endpoints for DoS susceptibility.

### 2.6 Application Security Testing
- **Objective:** Identify code-level and configuration vulnerabilities.
- Static code analysis (TypeScript, Node.js).
- Dynamic application security testing (DAST) for running services.
- Dependency analysis for vulnerable npm packages.

- Custom test scripts for business logic and workflow bypass.

### 3.3 Security Code Review
- Static analysis (SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode).
- Manual review of authentication, authorization, input validation, crypto routines.

### 3.4 Configuration Testing
- Validate secure configuration (CSP, CORS, rate limiting, environment isolation).
- Hardening review for Express.js, Node.js, TypeScript settings.

### 3.5 Compliance Testing
- Use compliance scanners (Qualys, PCI DSS tools, GDPR checkers).
- Review audit trails, logging, and data retention policies.

### 3.6 Social Engineering Testing
- (Optional/Enterprise Only) Simulate phishing or privilege escalation via social means (if client authorizes).

## 4. Security Test Scenarios

### 4.1 Authentication Attacks
- **Brute Force:** Attempt repeated logins with common/user-specific passwords.
- **Credential Stuffing:** Use leaked credential lists against API endpoints.
- **Session Hijacking:** Steal session tokens via XSS, inspect for JWT weaknesses.
- **Token Replay:** Use old/expired tokens to access protected resources.

### 4.2 Authorization Bypass
- **Privilege Escalation:** Access admin endpoints as lower-privilege user.
- **Horizontal Access:** Access another team's documents or templates.
- **Direct Object Reference:** Manipulate IDs/URIs to access unauthorized resources.

### 4.3 Injection Attacks
- **SQL/NoSQL Injection:** Test API, CLI, and template processing.
- **Command Injection:** Attempt shell injection via upload/file processing.
- **XSS:** Inject scripts into document templates, metadata, or logs.

### 4.4 Data Exposure
- **Sensitive Data Leakage:** Inspect API responses, logs, generated docs for PII, API keys, secrets.
- **Unintended Metadata:** Analyze PDFs and generated files for hidden/embedded sensitive data.
- **Information Disclosure:** Error messages, stack traces, version details.

### 4.5 Denial of Service
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Flood API endpoints, abuse file upload and document generation.
- **Logic Bombs:** Submit malformed or recursive templates causing server lockup.
- **API Rate Limit Bypass:** Test for unlimited requests via multiple vectors.

### 4.6 Cryptographic Failures
- **Weak Encryption:** Review TLS/HTTPS ciphers, document encryption algorithms.
- **Improper Key Management:** Test for keys in repo, .env, or logs.
