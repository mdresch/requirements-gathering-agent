## 🆕 Version Control System for Generated Documents (v2.1.3+)

The Requirements Gathering Agent now features a built-in version control system (VCS) for all generated documents!

### Key Features

- **Automatic Versioning:** Every time you generate or update documents, changes are automatically committed to a local git repository in the `generated-documents/` folder.
- **History & Diffs:** View the full history of changes, see diffs, and revert to previous versions of any generated document.
- **CLI VCS Commands:** Manage document version control directly from the CLI:

  ```bash
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs log
      # Show commit history for generated documents
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs diff <file>
      # Show changes for a specific document
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs revert <file> <commit>
      # Revert a document to a previous version
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs status
      # Show uncommitted changes
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs push
      # Push local changes to remote repository (if configured)
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs pull
      # Pull latest changes from remote repository (if configured)
  ```
- **Remote Sync (Optional):** Configure a remote git repository for backup and collaboration.
- **User Configurable:** Control VCS settings in `config-rga.json` (enable/disable, auto-commit, remote, branch, etc).
- **Full Audit Trail:** Every document change is tracked for compliance and traceability.

### How It Works

- On first run, a git repository is initialized in `generated-documents/` (if not already present).
- After each document generation, changes are auto-committed with a timestamp and provider/model info.
- Use the CLI VCS commands to inspect history, view diffs, revert, or sync with a remote.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Generate documents (auto-commit runs after generation)
requirements-gathering-agent

# View history
requirements-gathering-agent vcs log

# See changes for a specific file
requirements-gathering-agent vcs diff core-analysis/business-case.md

# Revert a file to a previous version
requirements-gathering-agent vcs revert core-analysis/business-case.md <commit-hash>

# Push changes to remote (if configured)
requirements-gathering-agent vcs push
```

- **Processors are registered in `processor-config.json`** using canonical keys.
- **ProcessorFactory** loads and instantiates processors based on this config, supporting both static and dynamic imports.
- **To add a new document type:**
  1. Implement your processor in `src/modules/documentTemplates/<category>/<YourProcessor>.ts`.
  2. Register it in `processor-config.json`.
  3. Add it to `generationTasks.ts` and update context relationships if needed.
  4. Add a Jest unit test for your processor (see below).
  5. Update documentation and CLI help.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md`](docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md) for full details.

**Built with ❤️ by [Menno Drescher] (https://exceptional-cba-project.webflow.io/) using Azure OpenAI**

## 🟡 Outstanding/Recent Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Zero Tokens in Context for Some Documents
- **Symptom:** Some generated documents (e.g., user-personas) showed `Final context: 0 tokens`.
- **Root Cause:** The Enhanced Context Manager was not being populated with the discovered markdown files from project analysis, resulting in an empty context for those documents.
- **Fix:** Added logic to ensure all discovered markdown files are added to the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context before document generation. Now, each document receives the full relevant context, and token counts reflect actual content.

### Issue: CLI Permission Denied (`npx rga`)
- **Symptom:** Running `npx rga` resulted in `Permission denied`.
- **Root Cause:** The CLI binary was not executable or not properly linked after build.
- **Fix:** Ensured the CLI is built (`npm run build`), has executable permissions (`chmod +x dist/cli.js`), and is correctly linked in the npm bin directory. Also, documented alternative run commands (`npm start`, `node dist/cli.js`).

### Issue: Enhanced Context Not Utilized for Large Models
- **Symptom:** Large language models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) were not utilizing their full context window.
- **Root Cause:** The context manager was not auto-detecting model capabilities or was too conservative in context allocation.
- **Fix:** Improved model detection and context allocation logic. Now, up to 90% of available tokens are used for ultra-large models, maximizing documentation accuracy.

## 🔧 Suggestions for Further Improvement

The Requirements Gathering Agent is robust and production-ready, but here are some areas for future enhancement—especially in the project analysis and context-building system:

- **Direct Context Injection:**  
  Add a function to directly inject all high-relevance markdown files into the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context, not just the combined context string. This will further improve per-document context building and accuracy for large LLMs.

- **Async Parallelization:**  
  For very large projects, consider parallelizing directory scans to speed up project analysis and markdown discovery.

- **Configurable Limits:**  
  Allow configuration of the maximum number of files and maximum content length included in the context via CLI options or environment variables, giving users more control over context size and performance.

- **Custom Directory Patterns:**  
  Enable users to specify additional directories or filename patterns to include or exclude in the analysis, making the tool even more flexible for diverse project structures.

- **Context Utilization Feedback:**  
  Provide real-time feedback or warnings if the context is being truncated due to token limits, and suggest ways to optimize context inclusion.

## 🆕 Version Control System for Generated Documents (v2.1.3+)

The Requirements Gathering Agent now features a built-in version control system (VCS) for all generated documents!

### Key Features

- **Automatic Versioning:** Every time you generate or update documents, changes are automatically committed to a local git repository in the `generated-documents/` folder.
- **History & Diffs:** View the full history of changes, see diffs, and revert to previous versions of any generated document.
- **CLI VCS Commands:** Manage document version control directly from the CLI:

  ```bash
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs log
      # Show commit history for generated documents
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs diff <file>
      # Show changes for a specific document
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs revert <file> <commit>
      # Revert a document to a previous version
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs status
      # Show uncommitted changes
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs push
      # Push local changes to remote repository (if configured)
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs pull
      # Pull latest changes from remote repository (if configured)
  ```
- **Remote Sync (Optional):** Configure a remote git repository for backup and collaboration.
- **User Configurable:** Control VCS settings in `config-rga.json` (enable/disable, auto-commit, remote, branch, etc).
- **Full Audit Trail:** Every document change is tracked for compliance and traceability.

### How It Works

- On first run, a git repository is initialized in `generated-documents/` (if not already present).
- After each document generation, changes are auto-committed with a timestamp and provider/model info.
- Use the CLI VCS commands to inspect history, view diffs, revert, or sync with a remote.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Generate documents (auto-commit runs after generation)
requirements-gathering-agent

# View history
requirements-gathering-agent vcs log

# See changes for a specific file
requirements-gathering-agent vcs diff core-analysis/business-case.md

# Revert a file to a previous version
requirements-gathering-agent vcs revert core-analysis/business-case.md <commit-hash>

# Push changes to remote (if configured)
requirements-gathering-agent vcs push
```

## 🧩 Modular Processor Architecture (2025 Update)

The Requirements Gathering Agent now uses a modular, configuration-driven processor factory for all document generation. This makes it easy to add, update, or swap document processors without changing core code.

- **Processors are registered in `processor-config.json`** using canonical keys.
- **ProcessorFactory** loads and instantiates processors based on this config, supporting both static and dynamic imports.
- **To add a new document type:**
  1. Implement your processor in `src/modules/documentTemplates/<category>/<YourProcessor>.ts`.
  2. Register it in `processor-config.json`.
  3. Add it to `generationTasks.ts` and update context relationships if needed.
  4. Add a Jest unit test for your processor (see below).
  5. Update documentation and CLI help.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md`](docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md) for full details.

## 🆕 Project KickOff Preparations Checklist

A new document type: **Project KickOff Preparations Checklist**

- **Purpose:** Provides a detailed, PMBOK-aligned checklist for project initiation, planning, setup, risk, communication, and more.
- **Canonical key:** `project-kickoff-preparations-checklist`
- **Output:** `planning-artifacts/project-kickoff-preparations-checklist.md`
- **How to generate:**
  ```pwsh
  requirements-gathering-agent --generate-planning
  # or generate all documents (includes checklist)
  requirements-gathering-agent
  ```
- **CLI listing:** Appears under planning artifacts in `--list-templates` and help output.

---

## 🛠️ How to Add New Document Types

1. Follow the modular processor pattern (see above).
2. Reference [`docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md`](docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md) for a step-by-step guide and worked example.
3. Add a Jest unit test for your processor (see guide for example).
4. Update CLI help and documentation.

**Built with ❤️ by [Menno Drescher] (https://exceptional-cba-project.webflow.io/) using Azure OpenAI**

## 🟡 Outstanding/Recent Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Zero Tokens in Context for Some Documents
- **Symptom:** Some generated documents (e.g., user-personas) showed `Final context: 0 tokens`.
- **Root Cause:** The Enhanced Context Manager was not being populated with the discovered markdown files from project analysis, resulting in an empty context for those documents.
- **Fix:** Added logic to ensure all discovered markdown files are added to the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context before document generation. Now, each document receives the full relevant context, and token counts reflect actual content.

### Issue: CLI Permission Denied (`npx rga`)
- **Symptom:** Running `npx rga` resulted in `Permission denied`.
- **Root Cause:** The CLI binary was not executable or not properly linked after build.
- **Fix:** Ensured the CLI is built (`npm run build`), has executable permissions (`chmod +x dist/cli.js`), and is correctly linked in the npm bin directory. Also, documented alternative run commands (`npm start`, `node dist/cli.js`).

### Issue: Enhanced Context Not Utilized for Large Models
- **Symptom:** Large language models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) were not utilizing their full context window.
- **Root Cause:** The context manager was not auto-detecting model capabilities or was too conservative in context allocation.
- **Fix:** Improved model detection and context allocation logic. Now, up to 90% of available tokens are used for ultra-large models, maximizing documentation accuracy.

## 🔧 Suggestions for Further Improvement

The Requirements Gathering Agent is robust and production-ready, but here are some areas for future enhancement—especially in the project analysis and context-building system:

- **Direct Context Injection:**  
  Add a function to directly inject all high-relevance markdown files into the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context, not just the combined context string. This will further improve per-document context building and accuracy for large LLMs.

- **Async Parallelization:**  
  For very large projects, consider parallelizing directory scans to speed up project analysis and markdown discovery.

- **Configurable Limits:**  
  Allow configuration of the maximum number of files and maximum content length included in the context via CLI options or environment variables, giving users more control over context size and performance.

- **Custom Directory Patterns:**  
  Enable users to specify additional directories or filename patterns to include or exclude in the analysis, making the tool even more flexible for diverse project structures.

- **Context Utilization Feedback:**  
  Provide real-time feedback or warnings if the context is being truncated due to token limits, and suggest ways to optimize context inclusion.

  requirements-gathering-agent vcs revert <file> <commit>
      # Revert a document to a previous version
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs status
      # Show uncommitted changes
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs push
      # Push local changes to remote repository (if configured)
  requirements-gathering-agent vcs pull
      # Pull latest changes from remote repository (if configured)
  ```
- **Remote Sync (Optional):** Configure a remote git repository for backup and collaboration.
- **User Configurable:** Control VCS settings in `config-rga.json` (enable/disable, auto-commit, remote, branch, etc).
- **Full Audit Trail:** Every document change is tracked for compliance and traceability.

### How It Works

- On first run, a git repository is initialized in `generated-documents/` (if not already present).
- After each document generation, changes are auto-committed with a timestamp and provider/model info.
- Use the CLI VCS commands to inspect history, view diffs, revert, or sync with a remote.

### Example Workflow

```bash
# Generate documents (auto-commit runs after generation)
requirements-gathering-agent

# View history
requirements-gathering-agent vcs log

# See changes for a specific file
requirements-gathering-agent vcs diff core-analysis/business-case.md

# Revert a file to a previous version
requirements-gathering-agent vcs revert core-analysis/business-case.md <commit-hash>

# Push changes to remote (if configured)
requirements-gathering-agent vcs push
```

## 🧩 Modular Processor Architecture (2025 Update)

The Requirements Gathering Agent now uses a modular, configuration-driven processor factory for all document generation. This makes it easy to add, update, or swap document processors without changing core code.

- **Processors are registered in `processor-config.json`** using canonical keys.
- **ProcessorFactory** loads and instantiates processors based on this config, supporting both static and dynamic imports.
- **To add a new document type:**
  1. Implement your processor in `src/modules/documentTemplates/<category>/<YourProcessor>.ts`.
  2. Register it in `processor-config.json`.
  3. Add it to `generationTasks.ts` and update context relationships if needed.
  4. Add a Jest unit test for your processor (see below).
  5. Update documentation and CLI help.

See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and [`docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md`](docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md) for full details.

---

## 🆕 Project KickOff Preparations Checklist

A new document type: **Project KickOff Preparations Checklist**

- **Purpose:** Provides a detailed, PMBOK-aligned checklist for project initiation, planning, setup, risk, communication, and more.
- **Canonical key:** `project-kickoff-preparations-checklist`
- **Output:** `planning-artifacts/project-kickoff-preparations-checklist.md`
- **How to generate:**
  ```pwsh
  requirements-gathering-agent --generate-planning
  # or generate all documents (includes checklist)
  requirements-gathering-agent
  ```
- **CLI listing:** Appears under planning artifacts in `--list-templates` and help output.

---

## 🛠️ How to Add New Document Types

1. Follow the modular processor pattern (see above).
2. Reference [`docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md`](docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md) for a step-by-step guide and worked example.
3. Add a Jest unit test for your processor (see guide for example).
4. Update CLI help and documentation.

**Built with ❤️ by [Menno Drescher] (https://exceptional-cba-project.webflow.io/) using Azure OpenAI**

## 🟡 Outstanding/Recent Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Zero Tokens in Context for Some Documents
- **Symptom:** Some generated documents (e.g., user-personas) showed `Final context: 0 tokens`.
- **Root Cause:** The Enhanced Context Manager was not being populated with the discovered markdown files from project analysis, resulting in an empty context for those documents.
- **Fix:** Added logic to ensure all discovered markdown files are added to the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context before document generation. Now, each document receives the full relevant context, and token counts reflect actual content.

### Issue: CLI Permission Denied (`npx rga`)
- **Symptom:** Running `npx rga` resulted in `Permission denied`.
- **Root Cause:** The CLI binary was not executable or not properly linked after build.
- **Fix:** Ensured the CLI is built (`npm run build`), has executable permissions (`chmod +x dist/cli.js`), and is correctly linked in the npm bin directory. Also, documented alternative run commands (`npm start`, `node dist/cli.js`).

### Issue: Enhanced Context Not Utilized for Large Models
- **Symptom:** Large language models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) were not utilizing their full context window.
- **Root Cause:** The context manager was not auto-detecting model capabilities or was too conservative in context allocation.
- **Fix:** Improved model detection and context allocation logic. Now, up to 90% of available tokens are used for ultra-large models, maximizing documentation accuracy.

## 🔧 Suggestions for Further Improvement

The Requirements Gathering Agent is robust and production-ready, but here are some areas for future enhancement—especially in the project analysis and context-building system:

- **Direct Context Injection:**  
  Add a function to directly inject all high-relevance markdown files into the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context, not just the combined context string. This will further improve per-document context building and accuracy for large LLMs.

- **Async Parallelization:**  
  For very large projects, consider parallelizing directory scans to speed up project analysis and markdown discovery.

- **Configurable Limits:**  
  Allow configuration of the maximum number of files and maximum content length included in the context via CLI options or environment variables, giving users more control over context size and performance.

- **Custom Directory Patterns:**  
  Enable users to specify additional directories or filename patterns to include or exclude in the analysis, making the tool even more flexible for diverse project structures.

- **Context Utilization Feedback:**  
  Provide real-time feedback or warnings if the context is being truncated due to token limits, and suggest ways to optimize context inclusion.


## 🧠 Enhanced llmProcessor.ts Improvements

⚡ Suggestions for Further Improvement
