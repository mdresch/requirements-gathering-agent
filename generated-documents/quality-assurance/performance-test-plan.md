## Performance Test Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:** To determine the performance characteristics of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) under various load conditions, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that the system meets predefined performance requirements.  This includes assessing response times, throughput, resource utilization, scalability, and stability.

* **Success Criteria and Benchmarks:**  The RGA must meet the following criteria (specific values to be determined based on further requirements gathering and profiling):

    * **Response Time:**  Average response time for document generation under peak load should be less than X seconds (95th percentile < Y seconds).  Specific response time targets for each document type should be defined.
    * **Throughput:**  The system should be able to generate Z documents per minute under peak load, with a minimum of W documents per minute under normal load.
    * **Resource Utilization:** CPU utilization should remain below 80%, memory utilization below 90%, and disk I/O should be within acceptable limits under peak load. Network utilization should be monitored and remain below 70%.
    * **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to handle a 2x increase in concurrent users and document generation requests without significant performance degradation.
    * **Stability:** The system should remain stable and responsive during extended periods of operation (endurance testing).  No crashes or significant performance degradation should occur during the endurance test.
    * **Error Rate:** The error rate for document generation should be less than 1%.


* **Testing Scope:** The performance testing will cover the entire RGA application, including document generation, context analysis, AI provider interaction, and file I/O.  Specific document types (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Technical Design Documents) will be included.

* **Limitations:**  Testing will be conducted within the constraints of the available test environment.  Certain aspects, such as integration with external systems (SharePoint, Confluence), may be tested separately or with limited scope due to resource constraints.


* **Performance Risk Assessment:** Key risks include:

    * **AI Provider Limitations:**  Performance limitations of the underlying AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) could impact RGA performance.
    * **Context Size:**  Large project contexts could exceed the token limits of some AI models, causing performance issues.
    * **Resource Contention:**  High concurrency could lead to resource contention (CPU, memory, I/O) and performance degradation.
    * **Network Latency:** Network connectivity issues could impact response times.


**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:**  See Success Criteria above.  Specific response time targets (e.g., <2 seconds for small documents, <10 seconds for complex documents) will be defined based on user stories and business requirements.

* **Throughput Requirements:** See Success Criteria above.  The expected transaction volume will be estimated based on anticipated usage patterns.

* **Resource Utilization Limits:** See Success Criteria above.  These limits should be established in consultation with system administrators and based on server capacity.

* **Scalability Targets:** See Success Criteria above.  Scalability testing will focus on increasing concurrent users and request rates.

* **Availability Requirements:**  The system should have 99.9% uptime.  Endurance testing will assess the system's ability to maintain performance over extended periods.


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal and peak user loads to assess response times and throughput under expected conditions.

* **Stress Testing:**  Exceed the normal capacity to identify breaking points and determine the system's resilience.

* **Volume Testing:**  Test the system's ability to handle large volumes of data (large projects with many documents).

* **Spike Testing:**  Simulate sudden increases in load to evaluate the system's response to unexpected surges.

* **Endurance Testing:**  Run the system under sustained load for an extended period (e.g., 24-48 hours) to identify performance degradation over time.

* **Capacity Testing:**  Determine the maximum number of concurrent users and the maximum transaction volume the system can handle before performance degrades significantly.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment:** A dedicated test environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible will be used. This includes hardware specifications (CPU, memory, disk, network), operating system, database, and application versions.

* **Hardware and Software Requirements:**  Specific hardware and software requirements will be determined based on the estimated load and the complexity of the test scenarios.  This might include multiple load generators and monitoring tools.

* **Network Configuration:**  The network configuration should simulate realistic network conditions, including latency and bandwidth limitations.

* **Test Data:**  Realistic test data, representing different project sizes and complexities, will be generated.  This data should include varied README files, project structures, and document types.

* **Environment Monitoring:**  System and application performance will be monitored using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and application-specific logging.


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:**  Simulate typical user workflows, including:
    * Generating a single document (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, etc.)
    * Generating multiple documents (full PMBOK suite)
    * Generating documents with different context sizes
    * Generating documents with large volumes of data
    * Using CLI commands for document generation
    * Using different AI providers

* **Business Process Scenarios:** Simulate end-to-end business processes, such as:
    * Project initiation and planning
    * Requirements gathering and analysis
    * Risk management
    * Stakeholder management
    * Document generation and review

* **System Integration Scenarios:**  Test the integration with external systems (if within scope):
    * SharePoint document publishing
    * Confluence document publishing

* **Background Process Scenarios:**  Test the performance of any background processes or scheduled tasks.

* **Peak Load Scenarios:**  Simulate the expected maximum load on the system, based on anticipated user behavior.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:**  JMeter or k6 will be used for load generation and scripting.  Gatling is also a strong contender.

* **Monitoring Tools:**  Prometheus and Grafana for system-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network).  Application-specific logging and tracing will also be used.  New Relic or Dynatrace could be considered for more comprehensive application monitoring.

* **Data Analysis Tools:**  Grafana for visualizing performance metrics.  Spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets) for data analysis and reporting.

* **Load Generation:**  JMeter or k6 will be configured to generate load from multiple machines to simulate a distributed user base.

* **Test Automation:**  JMeter or k6 scripts will be used to automate test execution and reporting.


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:** A detailed schedule will be created, outlining the timeline for each test phase (test environment setup, script development, test execution, data analysis, reporting).

* **Resource Allocation:**  The team will include performance test engineers, system administrators, and developers.

* **Test Data Management:**  A plan will be developed for managing test data, including data generation, setup, and cleanup.

* **Result Collection:**  Performance metrics will be collected automatically using the monitoring and testing tools.

* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system (Jira, etc.) will be used to track performance-related defects.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**

* **Response Time Metrics:** Average, median, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile response times for each document type and scenario.

* **Throughput Metrics:** Transactions per second (TPS), requests per minute (RPM), documents generated per minute.

* **System Resource Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O, network bandwidth utilization.

* **Error Rate Metrics:**  Percentage of failed requests, types of errors encountered.

* **Availability Metrics:**  System uptime and downtime.


**9. Success Criteria and Acceptance Thresholds**

* **Performance Benchmarks:** See Success Criteria in Section 1.

* **Pass/Fail Criteria:**  Tests will pass if all performance benchmarks are met.

* **Performance Targets:**  Optimal performance goals will be defined based on business requirements.

* **Escalation Thresholds:**  Warning levels will be defined for significant performance degradation.

* **Business Impact Assessment:**  The impact of performance issues on business operations will be assessed.


**10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

* **Performance Risks:** See Performance Risk Assessment in Section 1.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  Strategies will be implemented to mitigate identified risks (e.g., using multiple AI providers for redundancy, optimizing context size, scaling the infrastructure).

* **Contingency Plans:**  Alternative approaches will be planned if performance targets are not met (e.g., investigating performance bottlenecks, optimizing the application).

* **Performance Optimization:**  Strategies for performance improvement will be developed and implemented if necessary.

* **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:**  Clear criteria will be defined for deciding whether to release the RGA based on performance test results.


This Performance Test Plan provides a framework for evaluating the performance of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Specific values for benchmarks, thresholds, and schedules will need to be refined based on further requirements gathering, system profiling, and stakeholder input.
