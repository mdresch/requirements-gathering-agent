## Performance Test Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:**  To determine the performance characteristics of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) under various load conditions, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that the system meets defined performance requirements.  The goal is to ensure RGA can handle expected and peak user loads without significant performance degradation, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience.

* **Success Criteria and Performance Benchmarks:**  The performance tests will be considered successful if RGA meets the following benchmarks (detailed in Section 2):
    * Response times remain below defined thresholds for all critical operations.
    * System throughput meets or exceeds expected transaction volumes under various load scenarios.
    * Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) remains within acceptable limits.
    * The system scales effectively to handle increased user load and data volume.
    * System availability remains above the defined uptime target during endurance tests.

* **Testing Scope and Limitations:** This plan covers performance testing of the RGA application's core functionalities, including document generation, context analysis, and AI provider interaction.  It does *not* include testing of the underlying AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) or the network infrastructure outside the RGA application's control.  Testing will be limited to the defined test environments and scenarios.

* **Performance Risk Assessment:**  Key risks include:
    * Insufficient resources (hardware, network bandwidth) for load generation.
    * Unexpected behavior of the AI providers under high load.
    * Bottlenecks in database access or file I/O operations.
    * Unforeseen scalability issues.

Mitigation strategies will include rigorous environment setup, monitoring, and contingency planning (detailed in Section 10).


**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:**
    * Document generation (single document): < 15 seconds (95th percentile)
    * Document generation (batch of 10 documents): < 2 minutes (95th percentile)
    * Context analysis: < 5 seconds (95th percentile)
    * CLI command execution: < 2 seconds (95th percentile)

* **Throughput Requirements:**
    * Expected concurrent users: 50 (initial), 100 (target)
    * Transactions per second (TPS): 5 TPS (initial), 10 TPS (target)  (A transaction is defined as a single document generation request.)

* **Resource Utilization Limits:**
    * CPU utilization: < 80%
    * Memory utilization: < 70%
    * Disk I/O utilization: < 60%
    * Network utilization: < 70%

* **Scalability Targets:** The system should be able to handle a 2x increase in concurrent users and TPS without significant performance degradation.

* **Availability Requirements:**  99.9% uptime during endurance testing.


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal expected user load to assess system performance under typical conditions.  This will involve gradually increasing the number of virtual users.

* **Stress Testing:** Exceed normal capacity to identify breaking points and determine the system's behavior under extreme load.  This will involve significantly increasing the number of virtual users beyond the target capacity.

* **Volume Testing:**  Test the system's ability to handle large amounts of data, focusing on the context analysis and document generation processes.  This will involve generating large README files and assessing performance.

* **Spike Testing:**  Simulate sudden bursts of traffic to assess the system's ability to handle rapid load changes.

* **Endurance Testing:**  Run the system under sustained load for an extended period (e.g., 24 hours) to identify performance degradation over time.

* **Capacity Testing:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent users and TPS the system can handle before performance becomes unacceptable.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment Specifications:** A dedicated staging environment mirroring the production environment as closely as possible. This includes identical hardware specifications, software versions, database configurations, and network setup.

* **Hardware and Software Requirements:**
    * Load generators (multiple machines recommended for distributed load testing).
    * Monitoring tools (see Section 6).
    * RGA application server(s).
    * Database server.
    * Network infrastructure with sufficient bandwidth.

* **Network Configuration and Bandwidth Considerations:**  A high-bandwidth network connection is required to support the load generators and the application server. Network latency should be minimized.

* **Test Data Requirements and Generation Strategies:**  A set of realistic README files of varying sizes and complexity will be created for testing.  This data should represent typical user input.

* **Environment Monitoring and Instrumentation Setup:**  System-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network) and application-level metrics (response times, throughput, error rates) will be monitored using appropriate tools (see Section 6).


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:**
    * Generate a single document (various document types).
    * Generate a batch of 10 documents.
    * Execute a CLI command to generate all documents.

* **Business Process Scenarios:**
    * End-to-end testing of the entire document generation process.

* **System Integration Scenarios:** Testing the integration with various AI providers.

* **Background Process Scenarios:**  (Not applicable in this case, as RGA primarily focuses on on-demand generation).

* **Peak Load Scenarios:** Simulate the maximum expected concurrent user load and TPS.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:** JMeter, k6, Gatling (choice depends on team expertise and licensing).

* **Monitoring Tools:**  New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus (choice depends on existing infrastructure).  These tools will monitor server-side metrics (CPU, memory, etc.) and application performance indicators.

* **Data Analysis Tools:**  Grafana, Excel, specialized performance analysis tools provided by the chosen performance testing tool.

* **Load Generation:** Distributed load generation will be used to simulate realistic user load.

* **Test Automation:**  The performance tests will be automated using the chosen performance testing tool's scripting capabilities.


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:**
    * Phase 1: Environment setup and test script development (1 week).
    * Phase 2: Load testing (2 days).
    * Phase 3: Stress testing (1 day).
    * Phase 4: Volume testing (1 day).
    * Phase 5: Spike testing (1 day).
    * Phase 6: Endurance testing (2 days).
    * Phase 7: Report generation and analysis (1 week).

* **Resource Allocation:** A dedicated performance testing team will be assigned, including performance test engineers, system administrators, and developers.

* **Test Data Management:**  Test data will be managed using a dedicated database or file system.  Data will be cleaned up after each test run.

* **Result Collection:**  Performance metrics will be collected automatically using the monitoring and performance testing tools.

* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system (e.g., Jira) will be used to track and manage any performance-related issues identified during testing.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**

* **Response Time Metrics:** Average, median, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile response times for each test scenario.

* **Throughput Metrics:** TPS, requests per minute (RPM), and transactions completed.

* **System Resource Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O utilization, and network utilization for the application server and database server.

* **Error Rate Metrics:**  Percentage of failed requests and types of errors encountered.

* **Availability Metrics:** Uptime percentage during endurance testing.


**9. Success Criteria and Acceptance Thresholds**

The success criteria and acceptance thresholds are defined in Section 2 (Performance Requirements).  Any deviation from these thresholds will be investigated and addressed.


**10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

* **Performance Risks:**  See Section 1, Performance Risk Assessment.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  Thorough environment setup, monitoring, and proactive identification of bottlenecks.

* **Contingency Plans:**  If performance targets are not met, the team will investigate the root cause, implement performance optimizations, and re-run the tests.  A go/no-go decision will be made based on whether the performance issues are critical and can be addressed before release.

* **Performance Optimization:**  Performance tuning strategies will be implemented as needed, focusing on areas identified as bottlenecks.  This may involve code optimization, database tuning, or infrastructure upgrades.

* **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:** The system will only be considered ready for release if all performance requirements are met.  Critical performance issues that cannot be resolved before the release deadline will result in a "no-go" decision.
