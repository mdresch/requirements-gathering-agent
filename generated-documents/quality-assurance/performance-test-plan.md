# Performance Test Plan  
**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Prepared by:** Performance Test & QA Engineering Team

---

## 1. Performance Test Overview

### 1.1 Objectives and Goals

- **Validate** that the ADPA framework (API, CLI, and admin web interface) meets enterprise-grade performance, scalability, and reliability standards under realistic and peak workloads.
- **Identify** system bottlenecks, breaking points, and degradation risks in API, document generation, AI provider orchestration, and integration flows (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe).
- **Ensure** production readiness for high-concurrency, large-volume, and long-duration enterprise use cases as required by standards-compliant, Fortune 500 deployments.

### 1.2 Success Criteria & Benchmarks

- **Response Time:** < 2s for 95% of API requests under normal load; < 5s under peak load.
- **Throughput:** Support 250 concurrent users (API/CLI), > 1,500 document generation jobs/hour.
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU < 70%, RAM < 75%, Disk I/O < 60% saturation on primary nodes.
- **Scalability:** Linear throughput increase with additional API instances.
- **Availability:** 99.9% uptime during continuous 72-hour endurance testing.

### 1.3 Testing Scope & Limitations

- **In Scope:** REST API server (Express.js), CLI workflows, admin Next.js interface, AI orchestration, integration connectors, and document generation pipeline.
- **Out of Scope:** Non-production integrations (e.g., incomplete DMBOK features), legacy CLI, and experimental plugins.
- **Limitations:** Does not account for external failures (e.g., upstream AI provider outages), third-party API SLAs, or physical infrastructure failures outside the test environment.

### 1.4 Performance Risk Assessment

- **High:** AI provider latency, document template complexity, third-party integration limits.
- **Medium:** API authentication overhead, concurrent document creation, database/config file IO.
- **Low:** CLI command performance, admin portal under non-peak usage.

## 10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning

### 10.1 Performance Risks

- **AI Provider Latency/Outages:** May cause cascading delays in document generation.
- **Integration Service Throttling:** Rate limits from Confluence, SharePoint, or Adobe APIs.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Memory leaks or unhandled async jobs in Node.js.
- **Scaling Misconfiguration:** Insufficient horizontal scaling or slow instance provisioning.
- **Template Complexity:** Large or malformed templates causing high CPU/memory usage.

### 10.2 Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Provider Fallback:** Automatic switch to backup AI providers on timeout/failure.
- **Rate Limiting:** Internal throttling to avoid exceeding integration service quotas.
- **Health Checks:** Frequent, automated health checks with auto-remediation scripts.
- **Resource Monitoring:** Real-time alerts for high CPU/memory/disk with auto-scaling triggers.
- **Template Validation:** Pre-processing and validation of templates before job execution.

### 10.3 Contingency Plans

- **Job Queuing:** Queue and retry failed document jobs on transient errors.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Disable non-critical integrations under heavy load.
- **Rollback:** Roll back deployments if severe performance regressions detected.
- **Manual Intervention:** Engineering on-call for critical test windows.

### 10.4 Optimization Strategies

- **Code Profiling:** Node.js/TypeScript profiling to optimize hotspots.
- **Caching:** Redis or in-memory caching for frequent lookups and templates.
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Auto-scale API and worker instances in Kubernetes/Docker.
- **Async Processing:** Offload heavy/batch jobs to background workers.

### 10.5 Go/No-Go Decision Criteria

- **Go:** All pass/fail criteria met, no critical or high-severity unresolved defects, business impact assessed as acceptable.
- **No-Go:** Any critical failure in business processes, sustained resource exhaustion, or inability to scale as required.
