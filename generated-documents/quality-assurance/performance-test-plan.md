## Performance Test Plan: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:**  To determine the performance characteristics of the ADPA framework under various load conditions, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that the system meets predefined performance requirements for both the CLI and REST API.  This includes assessing scalability, stability, and resource utilization across different components (AI processing, document generation, API server, database interactions, integrations with external services like Confluence and SharePoint).

* **Success Criteria and Benchmarks:**  The system will be considered successful if it meets the following benchmarks under peak load conditions:
    * **API Response Time:**  < 500ms for 95th percentile of requests for document generation and other core API endpoints.  < 200ms for authentication endpoints.
    * **API Throughput:**  > 1000 requests per minute (RPM) for document generation, > 5000 RPM for authentication, with minimal error rates.
    * **CLI Response Time:** < 10 seconds for document generation and other core CLI commands.
    * **Resource Utilization:** CPU utilization < 80%, Memory utilization < 80%, Disk I/O < 70%, Network utilization < 70%.
    * **Error Rate:** < 1% for all operations.
    * **Scalability:**  The system should handle a 2x increase in concurrent users without significant performance degradation (response time increase < 20%).

* **Testing Scope:** The performance testing will cover the REST API, CLI, and key integrated components (AI providers, external document services).  The admin web interface will be tested separately.

* **Limitations:**  Testing will be performed using simulated user load.  Real-world user behavior and data variability may impact performance.  Specific third-party API limits (e.g., OpenAI token limits) are outside the scope of this test plan but will be considered during analysis.

* **Performance Risk Assessment:**  Key risks include:
    * **AI Provider Bottlenecks:**  Performance limitations of the underlying AI services.
    * **Database Performance:**  Inefficient database queries or insufficient database capacity.
    * **External Service Integration:**  Performance issues with Confluence, SharePoint, or Adobe Document Services.
    * **Resource Contention:** High resource utilization leading to performance degradation.

**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:** As defined in Success Criteria above.
* **Throughput Requirements:** As defined in Success Criteria above.
* **Resource Utilization Limits:** As defined in Success Criteria above.
* **Scalability Targets:** As defined in Success Criteria above (2x concurrent user increase).
* **Availability Requirements:** 99.9% uptime during peak load.


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal expected user load to determine system behavior under typical conditions.
* **Stress Testing:**  Push the system beyond its expected capacity to identify breaking points and system stability.
* **Volume Testing:**  Test the system's ability to handle large volumes of data (document sizes, number of documents processed concurrently).
* **Endurance Testing:**  Run the system under sustained load for an extended period (e.g., 24 hours) to assess stability and resource consumption over time.
* **Spike Testing:**  Simulate sudden increases in user load to evaluate the system's ability to handle bursts of activity.
* **Capacity Testing:** Determine the maximum user load the system can handle before performance degradation becomes unacceptable.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment:** A dedicated environment mirroring the production environment as closely as possible (hardware, software versions, network configuration, database size).
* **Hardware and Software Requirements:**  Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) with sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage, network bandwidth) to support the planned load generation. Specific hardware requirements will be determined based on load testing simulations.  The exact software configuration will mirror the production environment.
* **Network Configuration:**  High-bandwidth network connection with low latency.
* **Test Data Requirements:**  A representative dataset of documents, user accounts, and project configurations.  Data generation tools will be used to create realistic test data.
* **Environment Monitoring:**  System monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to capture metrics such as CPU, memory, disk I/O, network usage, and application performance indicators (e.g., response time, error rate).


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:**
    * **Scenario 1 (API):** User authentication, document generation (various document types and sizes), retrieval of generated documents.
    * **Scenario 2 (CLI):**  Document generation through CLI commands, integration with Confluence/SharePoint.
* **Business Process Scenarios:**
    * **Scenario 3 (API):**  End-to-end document generation pipeline (from data input to final document delivery).
* **System Integration Scenarios:**
    * **Scenario 4 (API):**  Document generation with external service integrations (Adobe, Confluence, SharePoint).
* **Background Process Scenarios:**  Testing of scheduled tasks and batch processing (if applicable).
* **Peak Load Scenarios:**  Simulate peak user load scenarios based on historical data or projected usage patterns.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:**  JMeter (for API and CLI load generation), k6 (for API load testing).
* **Monitoring Tools:**  Prometheus, Grafana (for system-level monitoring), Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) for application-level metrics.
* **Data Analysis Tools:**  Grafana, Excel, specialized performance analysis tools.
* **Load Generation:**  Distributed load generation setup using multiple load generators to simulate realistic user behavior.
* **Test Automation:**  JMeter scripts, k6 scripts, and automated reporting.


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:**  A detailed schedule outlining the timeline for each test phase (test environment setup, test data preparation, test execution, result analysis, reporting).
* **Resource Allocation:**  Define roles and responsibilities for the performance testing team (test lead, test engineers, infrastructure engineers).
* **Test Data Management:**  Establish procedures for test data creation, population, and cleanup.
* **Result Collection:**  Automated collection of performance metrics using monitoring tools and test scripts.
* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system (e.g., Jira) will be used to track and manage performance-related issues.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**

* **Response Time Metrics:** Average, median, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile response times for different API endpoints and CLI commands.
* **Throughput Metrics:**  Transactions per second (TPS), requests per minute (RPM), documents generated per minute.

* **Error Rate Metrics:**  Percentage of failed requests and errors.
* **Availability Metrics:**  System uptime and downtime.


**9. Success Criteria and Acceptance Thresholds**

* **Performance Benchmarks:** As defined in Success Criteria and Benchmarks section.
* **Pass/Fail Criteria:**  Tests will be considered passed if all benchmarks are met.
* **Performance Targets:**  Optimal performance goals (e.g., < 200ms response time for 95th percentile of API requests).
* **Escalation Thresholds:**  Define thresholds for performance degradation that trigger immediate investigation and action.
* **Business Impact Assessment:**  Assess the impact of performance issues on business operations.


**10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning**
