## Performance Test Plan: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) System

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:**  Validate the performance and scalability of the SCEV system's energy management unit (EMU), encompassing its ability to efficiently manage energy harvested from solar, kinetic, and thermal sources.  This includes verifying response times, throughput, resource utilization, and system stability under various load conditions.  The primary focus is on the EMU's real-time decision-making and data processing capabilities.

* **Success Criteria and Performance Benchmarks:**  The EMU must maintain a response time of under 100ms for 95% of requests under peak load conditions.  Throughput should exceed 1000 data points processed per second with less than 1% error rate.  CPU utilization should remain below 80%, memory below 90%, and disk I/O below 70% under peak load.  The system must maintain 99.9% uptime during endurance testing. Specific benchmarks will be defined based on simulation results from Milestone 1.

* **Testing Scope and Limitations:** This plan focuses on the performance of the EMU software and its interaction with sensor data.  It does not encompass the performance of individual energy harvesting components (solar panels, regenerative suspension, TEGs).  Testing will be conducted in a simulated environment initially, followed by real-world testing on a test mule (Milestone 3).

* **Performance Risk Assessment:**  Key risks include inadequate data processing capacity of the EMU, inefficient algorithms leading to high resource consumption, and potential bottlenecks in data communication between sensors and the EMU.  Mitigation strategies will involve performance tuning, algorithm optimization, and load balancing.


**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:** <100ms (95th percentile) for all critical EMU functions (energy flow decisions, data logging, user interface updates).

* **Throughput Requirements:** >1000 data points processed per second under peak load.

* **Resource Utilization Limits:** CPU < 80%, Memory < 90%, Disk I/O < 70%, Network < 60% under peak load.

* **Scalability Targets:** The system must be able to handle a 50% increase in data volume without significant performance degradation.

* **Availability Requirements:** 99.9% uptime during endurance testing (72 hours).


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal driving conditions with varying levels of sunlight, road conditions, and driving styles.
* **Stress Testing:** Simulate extreme conditions (e.g., rapid acceleration/deceleration, extreme temperatures, sudden influx of data) to identify breaking points.
* **Volume Testing:**  Process large volumes of sensor data (millions of data points) to evaluate data processing capacity.
* **Spike Testing:** Simulate sudden surges in data volume to assess the EMU's ability to handle unexpected spikes.
* **Endurance Testing:** Run the system continuously for 72 hours under sustained load to evaluate its stability and reliability.
* **Capacity Testing:** Determine the maximum data processing capacity of the EMU before performance degradation becomes unacceptable.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment Specifications:** A virtualized environment mirroring the target hardware specifications of the test mule.  This will include virtual machines representing the EMU, sensors, and data storage.
* **Hardware and Software Requirements:** High-performance servers with sufficient CPU, memory, and storage capacity.  The software environment will match the target deployment environment for the EMU.
* **Network Configuration and Bandwidth Considerations:**  A dedicated network with sufficient bandwidth to handle data transmission between sensors and the EMU.
* **Test Data Requirements and Generation Strategies:**  Synthetic data generation tools will be used to create realistic sensor data streams with varying characteristics.  Real-world data from Milestone 3 will be used for validation.
* **Environment Monitoring and Instrumentation Setup:**  System monitoring tools will be used to track CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and other relevant metrics.


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:** Simulate various driving scenarios (city driving, highway driving, off-road driving) with different levels of sunlight and road conditions.
* **Business Process Scenarios:**  Simulate energy generation and distribution under different driving scenarios.  Focus on how the EMU prioritizes power usage between battery charging and direct motor power.
* **System Integration Scenarios:**  Test the interaction between the EMU and various sensors.  This includes simulating sensor failures and data loss.
* **Background Process Scenarios:** Simulate data logging and analysis tasks running in the background.
* **Peak Load Scenarios:** Simulate peak energy demand scenarios (e.g., rapid acceleration, hill climbing) to assess system performance under stress.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:** JMeter, LoadRunner, k6 (selection based on team expertise and specific needs).
* **Monitoring Tools:** Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog (for system-level monitoring).  Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools like New Relic or Dynatrace may also be used.
* **Data Analysis Tools:**  Spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets) for initial analysis.  More advanced tools like Tableau or Power BI may be used for visualization and reporting.
* **Load Generation:**  JMeter or k6 will be used for distributed load generation to simulate multiple data streams.
* **Test Automation:**  Test scripts will be automated using appropriate scripting languages (e.g., Groovy for JMeter, JavaScript for k6).


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:**  The testing will be conducted in phases, starting with unit testing of individual EMU functions, followed by integration testing, and culminating in system-level performance testing.  A detailed schedule will be created based on project milestones.
* **Resource Allocation:**  A dedicated performance testing team will be assigned, including test engineers, system administrators, and developers.
* **Test Data Management:**  A robust data management strategy will be implemented to ensure data quality, consistency, and reusability.  This includes data generation, storage, and cleanup procedures.
* **Result Collection:**  Automated tools will collect performance metrics during test execution.
* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system will be used to track and manage identified performance issues.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**
