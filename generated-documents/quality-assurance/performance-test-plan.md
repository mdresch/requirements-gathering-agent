## Performance Test Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives:**  To determine the performance characteristics of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API under various load conditions, identify bottlenecks, and ensure it meets defined performance requirements for a production environment.  The goal is to validate the system's ability to handle expected and peak loads while maintaining acceptable response times and resource utilization.

* **Success Criteria:**  The API will be considered successful if it meets the following criteria under all tested scenarios:
    * Average response time for document generation < 2 seconds (95th percentile < 5 seconds).
    * Throughput of at least 100 document generation requests per minute.
    * CPU utilization remains below 80%, memory utilization below 70%, and disk I/O below 90% under peak load.
    * No errors or exceptions during endurance testing (24 hours).
    * System maintains 99.9% availability under sustained load.

* **Scope:** The performance tests will cover the `/api/v1/documents/convert` endpoint, focusing on document generation performance.  Other API endpoints will be tested for basic functionality but not subjected to extensive load testing.

* **Limitations:** Testing will be performed on a dedicated test environment mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.  External dependencies (AI providers) will be simulated to a certain extent, and their performance will not be directly measured.  Testing does not include security penetration or vulnerability assessments.


**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:**
    * Document Generation (POST /api/v1/documents/convert):  Average < 2 seconds, 95th percentile < 5 seconds.
    * Other API Endpoints:  Average < 1 second.

* **Throughput Requirements:**  Minimum 100 document generation requests per minute under normal load, 500 requests per minute under peak load.

* **Resource Utilization Limits:**
    * CPU:  < 80% utilization under peak load.
    * Memory: < 70% utilization under peak load.
    * Disk I/O: < 90% utilization under peak load.
    * Network:  < 80% utilization under peak load (bandwidth will be determined based on test environment).

* **Scalability Targets:**  The system should be able to scale horizontally to handle a tenfold increase in load within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., adding more server instances).

* **Availability Requirements:**  99.9% uptime.


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal expected user load.  This will involve gradually increasing the number of concurrent users to determine the system's behavior under sustained load.

* **Stress Testing:** Exceed normal capacity to identify breaking points.  This will involve significantly increasing the number of concurrent users beyond the expected peak load to determine the system's failure thresholds.

* **Volume Testing:** Test the system's ability to handle large amounts of data.  This will involve generating documents with varying sizes and complexities.

* **Spike Testing:** Simulate sudden, significant increases in load to verify the system's ability to handle abrupt changes.

* **Endurance Testing:**  Run the system under sustained load for an extended period (24 hours) to identify performance degradation over time.

* **Capacity Testing:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent users and transactions the system can handle before performance degradation becomes unacceptable.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment:**  A dedicated server environment mirroring the production environment as closely as possible in terms of hardware specifications, operating system, database, and network configuration.  This will include a load generator server and one or more application servers.

* **Hardware and Software Requirements:**  Specifications will be based on the production environment.  The load generator will require sufficient resources to handle the expected number of virtual users.

* **Network Configuration:**  A dedicated network with sufficient bandwidth to avoid network bottlenecks.

* **Test Data:**  Realistic test data representing different document generation requests (varying sizes and complexity of input JSON).  This data will be generated using a script to ensure consistency and scalability.

* **Environment Monitoring:**  System performance will be monitored using tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and New Relic, focusing on CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network traffic, and response times.


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:**
    * Scenario 1:  Generate a standard BABOK framework document.
    * Scenario 2: Generate a large, complex document with extensive requirements.
    * Scenario 3: Generate multiple documents concurrently.

* **Business Process Scenarios:**
    * Scenario 4: Simulate a typical workday load pattern with varying request rates.
    * Scenario 5: Simulate a peak load scenario during a critical project phase.

* **System Integration Scenarios:**  (To be defined based on the system's integrations.)

* **Background Process Scenarios:**  (Not applicable in this case, as there are no significant background processes.)

* **Peak Load Scenarios:**  A load test simulating five times the expected peak load to identify breaking points.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:**  JMeter (for load generation), k6 (alternative for load testing and scripting flexibility).

* **Monitoring Tools:**  Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic (for system and application performance monitoring).

* **Data Analysis Tools:**  Grafana (for visualizing performance metrics), Excel/Spreadsheet software (for detailed analysis).

* **Load Generation:**  JMeter or k6 will be used for distributed load generation across multiple machines if needed.

* **Test Automation:**  JMeter scripts will be developed to automate the test execution and reporting.


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:** (To be defined based on project timeline.  Allow sufficient time for test execution, analysis, and reporting.  Consider iterative testing with adjustments based on results.)

* **Resource Allocation:**  A dedicated performance testing team with expertise in JMeter/k6 and performance monitoring tools.

* **Test Data Management:**  A script will be used to generate and manage test data, ensuring data consistency and scalability.

* **Result Collection:**  Performance metrics will be collected automatically by JMeter/k6 and monitoring tools.  Results will be stored in a central database or file system.

* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system (e.g., Jira) will be used to track and manage identified performance issues.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**

* **Response Time Metrics:**  Average, median, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile response times for document generation.

* **Throughput Metrics:**  Transactions per second (TPS), requests per minute (RPM) for document generation.

* **System Resource Metrics:**  CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, and network bandwidth utilization on both the application and load generator servers.

* **Error Rate Metrics:**  Number and percentage of failed requests, error types.

* **Availability Metrics:**  System uptime during endurance testing.


**9. Success Criteria and Acceptance Thresholds**

(Defined in Section 1. Performance Test Overview)


**10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

* **Performance Risks:**  Unforeseen external dependencies, insufficient test environment resources, unexpected database performance issues, AI provider limitations.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  Thorough environment setup and testing, use of realistic test data, monitoring external dependencies, and having contingency plans for unexpected issues.

* **Contingency Plans:**  If performance targets are not met, the team will investigate the root causes, implement performance optimizations, and re-run the tests.  This may involve scaling the infrastructure or optimizing the application code.

* **Performance Optimization:**  Strategies will include code optimization, database tuning, and caching mechanisms.

* **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:**  The system will be considered ready for production if it meets all defined success criteria and performance thresholds.  Otherwise, further investigation and optimization will be required.


This plan provides a detailed framework. Specific timelines, resource allocation, and detailed test scripts will be developed during the test planning phase.  Regular progress reports and status updates will be provided to stakeholders.
