**8. Regression Test Cases**

Regression testing will be performed after each code change or bug fix.  The test cases from sections 2-7 will serve as the basis for regression testing, ensuring that existing functionality remains unaffected by new features or bug fixes.


**9. Test Data Requirements**

Test data will include various README.md files with different levels of complexity, including:

* Simple README with basic project information.
* Complex README with detailed project information, multiple sections, and different formatting styles.
* README with missing or incomplete information.
* README with malicious input strings (for security testing).


**10. Test Case Execution Guidelines**

* **Execution Order:**  Execute functional tests first, followed by UI, integration, performance, security, negative, and finally regression tests.  Dependencies between test cases should be noted.
* **Environment Prerequisites:**  A suitable test environment with necessary software and API access must be set up.
* **Test Result Documentation:**  All test results should be documented in a test execution report, including pass/fail status, screenshots (where applicable), and detailed logs.
* **Defect Reporting Procedures:**  Any defects found during testing should be reported using a standardized defect tracking system, including detailed descriptions, steps to reproduce, and expected vs. actual results.


This detailed test cases document provides a comprehensive framework for testing the ADPA tool.  Specific test data and thresholds (e.g., response times) should be defined before test execution.  The test cases should be regularly reviewed and updated as the project evolves.
