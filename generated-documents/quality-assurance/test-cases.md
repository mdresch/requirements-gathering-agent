## Test Cases Documentation: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

**1. Test Case Overview**

* **Purpose and Scope:** These test cases verify the functionality, usability, performance, security, and integration of the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) system, encompassing its hardware components (solar panels, regenerative suspension, thermoelectric generators) and software components (AI-powered Energy Management Unit - EMU).  They cover various scenarios, including normal operation, edge cases, and failure conditions.

* **Test Case Naming Conventions:**  `TC_[Module]_[Feature]_[Scenario]_[ID]` (e.g., `TC_SolarPanel_PowerGeneration_SunnyDay_001`)

* **Test Case Categories and Priorities:**
    * **Functional:** Verify core functionalities (energy harvesting, charging, display).  Priorities: Critical, High, Medium.
    * **UI:** Verify user interface elements and navigation. Priorities: High, Medium.
    * **Integration:** Verify communication between components (solar, kinetic, thermal, EMU, battery). Priorities: Critical, High.
    * **Performance:** Evaluate system performance under various conditions. Priorities: High, Medium.
    * **Security:** Verify data protection and system security. Priorities: Critical, High.
    * **Negative:** Test error handling and robustness. Priorities: High, Medium.
    * **Regression:** Verify functionality after code changes. Priorities: Medium, Low.

* **Traceability to Requirements:** Each test case will explicitly reference the relevant requirement from the project documentation.  This will be indicated in the "Requirements Traceability" column.  (Note:  Requirements are implicitly defined in the provided context.  A formal requirements document would be necessary for complete traceability.)

**10. Test Case Execution Guidelines**

* **Execution Order and Dependencies:**  Test cases will be executed in a logical order, with dependencies clearly defined.  Integration tests, for example, will require successful completion of individual component tests.

* **Environment Prerequisites:**  Test environment will include a representative vehicle setup (test mule), appropriate testing tools (data acquisition systems, simulation software), and a controlled testing environment.

* **Test Result Documentation:**  Detailed test results, including logs, screenshots, and performance metrics, will be meticulously documented.

* **Defect Reporting Procedures:**  A standardized defect reporting process will be followed, including clear description of the defect, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.


This document provides a framework for the test cases.  The actual number of test cases will significantly increase as the project progresses and requirements are further refined.  This is a starting point for a comprehensive test plan.  Each section needs to be fleshed out with more specific test cases covering the detailed functionality and requirements of the SCEV project.
