# Code Review Process and Guidelines
## === PROJECT README ===
Let's brainstorm a completely different and ambitious project: "Self-Charging Electric Vehicles" (SCEV).

This is a fascinating concept that tackles one of the biggest hurdles for electric vehicle adoption. Here's a breakdown of the idea.

Project Idea: The "Perpetual Motion" EV
1. The Elevator Pitch

We are developing a new class of electric vehicles that significantly reduce the need to plug in by harvesting ambient energy from their environment. By integrating advanced solar, kinetic, and thermal energy recovery systems, the vehicle constantly "trickle-charges" itself during driving and even while parked, dramatically extending its effective range and reducing reliance on traditional charging infrastructure.

2. The Problem It Solves

Range Anxiety: The single biggest fear for potential EV buyers. Our system directly counters this by continuously adding miles back to the battery.
Charging Infrastructure Gaps: In many urban and rural areas, reliable public charging is scarce. This project makes EVs viable for a much wider audience.
Grid Strain: A massive influx of EVs will put an enormous strain on the electrical grid. Self-charging vehicles lessen this load by generating a portion of their own power.
Cost and Inconvenience: Reduces the time and money spent at charging stations and the hassle of installing a home charger.
3. Core Technologies to Integrate

This isn't about a single solution, but a holistic system of multiple energy-harvesting technologies managed by a central AI.

1. Advanced Photovoltaic Body Panels:

Concept: Instead of a simple solar roof, the car's entire body—hood, roof, trunk, and even doors—is constructed from a lightweight, durable composite material with integrated, high-efficiency solar cells.
Innovation: Using new perovskite or multi-junction solar cells that are more efficient, flexible, and perform better in low-light conditions than traditional silicon.
2. Regenerative Suspension System:

Concept: Standard regenerative braking captures energy when slowing down. We'll add a system that captures energy from the vertical movement of the suspension.
Innovation: Each shock absorber is replaced with a linear electromagnetic generator. Every bump, pothole, and body roll during a turn generates electricity by moving magnets through coils, turning wasted kinetic energy into usable power.
3. Thermoelectric Generation (TEG):

Concept: Capture waste heat from various sources and convert it into electricity.
Innovation: TEG modules would be placed on the battery pack, electric motors, and radiator. As these components heat up during operation, the temperature difference is used to generate a steady stream of power.
4. AI-Powered Energy Management Unit (EMU):

Concept: The "brain" of the system. It's not enough to just generate power; it must be managed intelligently.
Innovation: The EMU uses machine learning to:
Predict energy generation: It analyzes weather forecasts (sunlight), GPS route data (hills, rough roads), and driving style to predict how much energy can be harvested.
Optimize energy flow: It decides in real-time whether to send harvested energy directly to the motors for immediate use or to the battery for storage, based on the current state of charge and predicted needs.
Provide user feedback: A dashboard shows the driver in real-time how much energy is being generated from each source (solar, kinetic, thermal).
4. First Few Project Milestones

M1: Component Feasibility & Simulation: Research and benchmark the most promising solar, kinetic, and thermoelectric technologies. Create a detailed digital twin of a standard EV to simulate the potential energy gains under various real-world conditions (e.g., a sunny commute in Arizona vs. a bumpy, overcast day in Seattle).
M2: Prototype Development: Build and lab-test a functional prototype of the three core hardware systems: a car hood made of photovoltaic composite, a single regenerative shock absorber, and a TEG unit for a battery pack.
M3: Test Mule Integration: Retrofit an existing electric vehicle (the "test mule") with the prototype hardware. The goal is not full integration, but to mount the systems and collect real-world performance data.
M4: Energy Management Unit (EMU) v1.0: Develop the initial software and hardware for the EMU. In this phase, it will only need to accurately read data from all the new sensors and log it for analysis. Control logic will come in a later milestone.
This project represents a fundamental shift from thinking of an EV as a device that simply consumes power to one that actively participates in its own energy lifecycle.

# CLI Refactor Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the recommended steps to refactor the Requirements Gathering Agent CLI for improved maintainability, modularity, and scalability. The approach leverages a modern CLI framework (Yargs), modular command structure, and best practices for configuration and code organization.

---

## 1. Adopt a CLI Framework (Yargs)

**Why:**
- Simplifies argument parsing and validation
- Automatically generates help output
- Makes commands and options declarative and discoverable

**How:**
- Install Yargs:
  ```sh
  npm install yargs @types/yargs
  ```
- Refactor `src/cli.ts` to use Yargs for all command and option parsing.
- Example starter:
  ```typescript
  import yargs from 'yargs';
  import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers';

  yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
    .command('generate [key]', 'Generate a document', (yargs) => {
      yargs.positional('key', { type: 'string', describe: 'Document key' });
    }, (argv) => {
      // Call generate logic
    })
    .option('output', { type: 'string', default: 'generated-documents' })
    .help()
    .argv;
  ```
- Remove all manual `process.argv` parsing and helper functions.

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Duplicate imports**: Remove old import statements when adding Yargs imports
- **Type errors**: Use proper type assertions for argv values (e.g., `argv.format as 'markdown' | 'json' | 'yaml'`)
- **Missing modules**: Create placeholder functions or use dynamic imports for non-essential commands during transition

---

## 2. Increase Modularity (Command Extraction)

**Why:**
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Each command is independently testable

**How:**
- Create a `src/commands/` directory.
- Move logic for each major command (e.g., generate, confluence, sharepoint, vcs) into its own file:
  ```
  src/
    commands/
      generate.ts
      confluence.ts
      sharepoint.ts
      vcs.ts
      utils/
        validation.ts

Let's brainstorm a completely different and ambitious project: "Self-Charging Electric Vehicles" (SCEV).

## 1. Executive Summary

This document establishes comprehensive code review processes and guidelines for === PROJECT README ===
Let's brainstorm a completely different and ambitious project: "Self-Charging Electric Vehicles" (SCEV).

This is a fascinating concept that tackles one of the biggest hurdles for electric vehicle adoption. Here's a breakdown of the idea.

Project Idea: The "Perpetual Motion" EV
1. The Elevator Pitch

We are developing a new class of electric vehicles that significantly reduce the need to plug in by harvesting ambient energy from their environment. By integrating advanced solar, kinetic, and thermal energy recovery systems, the vehicle constantly "trickle-charges" itself during driving and even while parked, dramatically extending its effective range and reducing reliance on traditional charging infrastructure.

2. The Problem It Solves

Range Anxiety: The single biggest fear for potential EV buyers. Our system directly counters this by continuously adding miles back to the battery.
Charging Infrastructure Gaps: In many urban and rural areas, reliable public charging is scarce. This project makes EVs viable for a much wider audience.
Grid Strain: A massive influx of EVs will put an enormous strain on the electrical grid. Self-charging vehicles lessen this load by generating a portion of their own power.
Cost and Inconvenience: Reduces the time and money spent at charging stations and the hassle of installing a home charger.
3. Core Technologies to Integrate

This isn't about a single solution, but a holistic system of multiple energy-harvesting technologies managed by a central AI.

1. Advanced Photovoltaic Body Panels:

Concept: Instead of a simple solar roof, the car's entire body—hood, roof, trunk, and even doors—is constructed from a lightweight, durable composite material with integrated, high-efficiency solar cells.
Innovation: Using new perovskite or multi-junction solar cells that are more efficient, flexible, and perform better in low-light conditions than traditional silicon.
2. Regenerative Suspension System:

Concept: Standard regenerative braking captures energy when slowing down. We'll add a system that captures energy from the vertical movement of the suspension.
Innovation: Each shock absorber is replaced with a linear electromagnetic generator. Every bump, pothole, and body roll during a turn generates electricity by moving magnets through coils, turning wasted kinetic energy into usable power.
3. Thermoelectric Generation (TEG):

Concept: Capture waste heat from various sources and convert it into electricity.
Innovation: TEG modules would be placed on the battery pack, electric motors, and radiator. As these components heat up during operation, the temperature difference is used to generate a steady stream of power.
4. AI-Powered Energy Management Unit (EMU):

Concept: The "brain" of the system. It's not enough to just generate power; it must be managed intelligently.
Innovation: The EMU uses machine learning to:
Predict energy generation: It analyzes weather forecasts (sunlight), GPS route data (hills, rough roads), and driving style to predict how much energy can be harvested.
Optimize energy flow: It decides in real-time whether to send harvested energy directly to the motors for immediate use or to the battery for storage, based on the current state of charge and predicted needs.
Provide user feedback: A dashboard shows the driver in real-time how much energy is being generated from each source (solar, kinetic, thermal).
4. First Few Project Milestones

M1: Component Feasibility & Simulation: Research and benchmark the most promising solar, kinetic, and thermoelectric technologies. Create a detailed digital twin of a standard EV to simulate the potential energy gains under various real-world conditions (e.g., a sunny commute in Arizona vs. a bumpy, overcast day in Seattle).
M2: Prototype Development: Build and lab-test a functional prototype of the three core hardware systems: a car hood made of photovoltaic composite, a single regenerative shock absorber, and a TEG unit for a battery pack.
M3: Test Mule Integration: Retrofit an existing electric vehicle (the "test mule") with the prototype hardware. The goal is not full integration, but to mount the systems and collect real-world performance data.
M4: Energy Management Unit (EMU) v1.0: Develop the initial software and hardware for the EMU. In this phase, it will only need to accurately read data from all the new sensors and log it for analysis. Control logic will come in a later milestone.
This project represents a fundamental shift from thinking of an EV as a device that simply consumes power to one that actively participates in its own energy lifecycle.

3. Click **Next**
4. Choose **Server-to-Server** authentication
5. Click **Save configured API**

## Step 4: Get Your Credentials

After adding the API, you'll see your credentials:

### Copy these values to your .env file:

```bash
# From the "Credentials" section in Adobe Developer Console:

ADOBE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_from_console
ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_from_console  
ADOBE_ORGANIZATION_ID=your_org_id_from_console
```

# CLI Refactor Implementation Guide

This guide outlines the recommended steps to refactor the Requirements Gathering Agent CLI for improved maintainability, modularity, and scalability. The approach leverages a modern CLI framework (Yargs), modular command structure, and best practices for configuration and code organization.

---

## 1. Adopt a CLI Framework (Yargs)

**Why:**
- Simplifies argument parsing and validation
- Automatically generates help output
- Makes commands and options declarative and discoverable

**How:**
- Install Yargs:
  ```sh
  npm install yargs @types/yargs
  ```
- Refactor `src/cli.ts` to use Yargs for all command and option parsing.
- Example starter:
  ```typescript
  import yargs from 'yargs';
  import { hideBin } from 'yargs/helpers';

  yargs(hideBin(process.argv))
    .command('generate [key]', 'Generate a document', (yargs) => {
      yargs.positional('key', { type: 'string', describe: 'Document key' });
    }, (argv) => {
      // Call generate logic
    })
    .option('output', { type: 'string', default: 'generated-documents' })
    .help()
    .argv;
  ```
- Remove all manual `process.argv` parsing and helper functions.

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Duplicate imports**: Remove old import statements when adding Yargs imports
- **Type errors**: Use proper type assertions for argv values (e.g., `argv.format as 'markdown' | 'json' | 'yaml'`)
- **Missing modules**: Create placeholder functions or use dynamic imports for non-essential commands during transition

---

## 2. Increase Modularity (Command Extraction)

**Why:**
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Each command is independently testable

**How:**
- Create a `src/commands/` directory.
- Move logic for each major command (e.g., generate, confluence, sharepoint, vcs) into its own file:
  ```
  src/
    commands/
      generate.ts
      confluence.ts
      sharepoint.ts
      vcs.ts
      utils/
        validation.ts
