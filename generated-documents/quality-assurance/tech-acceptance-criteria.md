## Technical Acceptance Criteria: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

This document outlines the technical acceptance criteria for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project, covering functional, performance, security, reliability, compatibility, and maintainability aspects.  The criteria are tailored to the project's phased approach, focusing on milestones M1-M4.

**Note:**  This document assumes the existence of a comprehensive requirements specification document.  These criteria are supplemental and focus on the *technical* aspects of meeting those requirements.


### 1. Functional Technical Criteria

**1.1 API Functionality (M4 - EMU v1.0):**

* **Criterion:** The EMU API shall expose endpoints for retrieving sensor data (solar panel output, kinetic energy generation, TEG output, battery state of charge) and providing system status information.
* **Test Scenarios:**  
    * Scenario 1:  Successful retrieval of sensor data via GET requests to designated endpoints.
    * Scenario 2:  Verification of correct data formats (JSON) in API responses.
    * Scenario 3:  Testing of error handling for invalid requests (e.g., incorrect parameters, unauthorized access).
* **Success Metrics:** 100% successful responses for valid requests, accurate data representation, appropriate HTTP status codes for errors.
* **Validation Method:** Automated API testing using tools like Postman or REST-assured.
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  All test scenarios must pass with 100% success rate.


**1.2 Data Processing (M4 - EMU v1.0):**

* **Criterion:** The EMU shall accurately process sensor data, validating data integrity and handling outliers.
* **Test Scenarios:**
    * Scenario 1:  Injecting valid and invalid sensor data to verify data validation.
    * Scenario 2:  Injecting outlier data to check for appropriate handling (e.g., filtering, logging).
    * Scenario 3:  Verification of data storage format and integrity.
* **Success Metrics:** 100% successful data validation, accurate outlier detection and handling, data consistency checks pass.
* **Validation Method:** Unit and integration tests.
* **Acceptance Threshold:** 99% accuracy in data processing and validation.


**1.3 Business Logic (M4 - EMU v1.0):**

* **Criterion:** The EMU's energy management algorithm shall distribute harvested energy optimally between battery charging and direct motor power, maximizing vehicle range.
* **Test Scenarios:** Simulation tests under various driving conditions (e.g., highway driving, city driving, varied weather).
* **Success Metrics:**  Quantifiable improvement in simulated vehicle range compared to a baseline scenario without energy optimization.
* **Validation Method:**  Simulation using a digital twin of the vehicle and environment.
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  At least 10% improvement in simulated range.


**1.4 Integration Points (M3 - Test Mule Integration):**

* **Criterion:** The prototype hardware components (solar panels, regenerative shock absorbers, TEG units) shall integrate seamlessly with the test mule's existing electrical system.
* **Test Scenarios:**  Verification of power flow, data transmission between components and the EMU.
* **Success Metrics:**  Successful data acquisition from all components, stable power flow without system failures.
* **Validation Method:**  Real-world testing on the test mule.
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  No critical errors or system failures during testing.


**1.5 User Interface (M4 - EMU v1.0):**

* **Criterion:** The user interface shall display real-time energy generation data from each source and overall system status.
* **Test Scenarios:**  Verification of UI responsiveness, data accuracy, and accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines).
* **Success Metrics:**  Accurate display of data, UI load time under 2 seconds, successful accessibility audit.
* **Validation Method:**  Manual testing, automated UI testing (e.g., Selenium).
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  All test scenarios pass; UI meets accessibility standards.


### 2. Performance Acceptance Criteria

**2.1 Response Time (M4 - EMU v1.0):**

* **Criterion:** The EMU API shall respond within 100ms for data retrieval requests under normal load.
* **Test Scenarios:**  Load testing simulating multiple concurrent requests.
* **Success Metrics:**  Average response time below 100ms; 99th percentile response time below 200ms.
* **Validation Method:** Load testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Gatling).
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  Metrics must meet specified thresholds.


**2.2 Throughput (M4 - EMU v1.0):**

* **Criterion:** The EMU shall process at least 100 data points per second from all sources.
* **Test Scenarios:**  Load testing simulating high data volume.
* **Success Metrics:**  Successful processing of 100+ data points per second.
* **Validation Method:**  Load testing and performance monitoring.
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  Throughput must meet the specified minimum.


**(Criteria 2.3-2.5 will be defined in later phases based on system architecture and performance testing results.)**


### 3. Security Acceptance Criteria

**(Security criteria will be defined in later phases based on the finalized system architecture and security risk assessment.)**


### 4. Reliability and Availability Criteria

**(Reliability and availability criteria will be defined in later phases based on the finalized system architecture and operational requirements.)**


### 5. Compatibility and Integration Criteria

**5.1 Browser Compatibility (M4 - EMU v1.0 â€“ if applicable):**

* **Criterion:** The EMU's user interface (if any) shall be compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest two versions).
* **Test Scenarios:**  Testing UI functionality across supported browsers.
* **Success Metrics:**  Successful UI rendering and functionality in all specified browsers.
* **Validation Method:**  Manual testing.
* **Acceptance Threshold:**  All test scenarios pass.


**(Criteria 5.2-5.5 will be defined in later phases based on system architecture and integration requirements.)**


### 6. Quality and Maintainability Criteria

**(Quality and maintainability criteria will be defined in later phases and will include code style guidelines, code coverage targets, and documentation standards.)**


### 7. Validation Methods and Test Scenarios (Summary)

The specific validation methods and test scenarios for each criterion are detailed within each section above.  Automated testing will be preferred wherever possible to ensure repeatability and efficiency.  Manual testing will be used for UI and usability aspects.  Success metrics and acceptance thresholds are defined for each criterion to allow for objective evaluation.  Failure conditions will be documented as part of each test case.


This document provides a framework for the technical acceptance criteria.  It will be iteratively refined as the project progresses and more detailed requirements are defined.  The specific acceptance thresholds may be adjusted based on testing results and project needs.
