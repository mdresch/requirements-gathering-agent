## Technical Acceptance Criteria: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

This document outlines the technical acceptance criteria for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The criteria are categorized for clarity and cover functional, performance, security, reliability, compatibility, and maintainability aspects.  Given the project's explicit exclusion of security features (as per `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`), security criteria are minimized to essential data handling and API protection.

**1. Functional Technical Criteria**

| Criterion ID | Description | Validation Method | Test Scenarios | Success Metrics | Failure Conditions | Acceptance Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FC-1.1 | API Endpoint `/api/v1/health` returns a JSON object with `status`, `timestamp`, `version`, and `uptime` fields. | Automated API testing (e.g., Postman, REST-assured) | 1. GET request to `/api/v1/health`. 2. Verify JSON response structure and field values. | 100% successful responses with correct data types and values. | Missing fields, incorrect data types, non-JSON response, error response. | 100% success rate over 100 consecutive runs. |
| FC-1.2 | API Endpoint `/api/v1/templates` returns a JSON array of available templates with pagination. | Automated API testing | 1. GET request to `/api/v1/templates` with various pagination parameters. 2. Verify JSON response structure, pagination links, and data integrity. | 100% successful responses with correct pagination and data.  | Incorrect data structure, missing pagination information, incomplete data, error response. | 100% success rate over 100 consecutive runs with varied pagination. |
| FC-1.3 | API Endpoint `/api/v1/documents/convert` accepts a valid template ID and input data, and returns a JSON object representing the generated document. | Automated API testing | 1. POST request with valid template ID and input data. 2. Verify JSON response structure and generated document content. | 100% successful responses with correctly generated documents. | Invalid template ID, missing input data, incorrect data format, error response, incomplete or corrupted document. | 100% success rate over 50 consecutive runs with varied input data and templates. |
| FC-2.1 | CLI correctly generates PMBOK compliant documents (Charter, Stakeholder Register, etc.) based on provided input. | Manual and automated testing (integration tests) | 1. Execute CLI commands with various input options. 2. Verify output files are valid JSON and conform to PMBOK standards. | 100% correctly formatted PMBOK documents generated.  | Incorrect formatting, missing sections, invalid JSON, exceptions during generation. | 100% success rate for all required document types over 10 runs with varied input. |
| FC-3.1 | System supports multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) with configurable fallback mechanisms. | Automated testing (unit and integration tests) | 1. Configure the system for each provider. 2. Simulate provider failures and verify fallback mechanisms. | 100% successful execution with each provider; successful fallback to alternative providers when primary provider fails. | Failure to connect to any provider without graceful fallback, incorrect provider selection, system crash. |  Successful execution and fallback for all supported providers in 10 test runs per provider. |


**2. Performance Acceptance Criteria**

| Criterion ID | Description | Validation Method | Test Scenarios | Success Metrics | Failure Conditions | Acceptance Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PC-1.1 | API response time for `/api/v1/health` should be less than 100ms. | Automated load testing (e.g., JMeter, k6) | 1. Send 100 concurrent requests to `/api/v1/health`. 2. Measure average response time. | Average response time < 100ms, 99th percentile response time < 200ms. | Average response time exceeding 100ms, 99th percentile response time exceeding 200ms. |  Average response time under 100ms, 99th percentile under 200ms under 100 concurrent requests. |
| PC-1.2 | API response time for `/api/v1/documents/convert` should be less than 5 seconds (average) for documents under 10KB. | Automated load testing | 1. Send 50 concurrent requests to `/api/v1/documents/convert` with small input data. 2. Measure average and 99th percentile response times. | Average response time < 5s, 99th percentile response time < 10s. | Average response time exceeding 5s, 99th percentile response time exceeding 10s. | Average response time under 5 seconds, 99th percentile response time under 10 seconds under 50 concurrent requests. |
| PC-2.1 | CLI execution time for generating a standard PMBOK charter should be less than 30 seconds. | Manual timing and profiling | 1. Time the execution of the CLI command for generating a PMBOK charter. | Execution time < 30 seconds. | Execution time exceeding 30 seconds. | Execution time consistently under 30 seconds over 10 runs. |


**3. Reliability and Availability Criteria**

| Criterion ID | Description | Validation Method | Test Scenarios | Success Metrics | Failure Conditions | Acceptance Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RA-1.1 | System should handle exceptions gracefully and provide informative error messages. | Manual testing and log analysis | 1. Trigger various error conditions (invalid input, network errors, etc.). 2. Verify error messages and system behavior. | 100% of error conditions handled gracefully with informative error messages.  | System crashes, unhandled exceptions, cryptic error messages. |  Informative and actionable error messages for all anticipated error scenarios.  |
| RA-2.1 | System should maintain data integrity during document generation and storage. | Data validation and integrity checks | 1. Generate documents with various input data. 2. Verify data consistency and absence of corruption. | 100% data integrity across all generated documents. | Data corruption, inconsistencies, data loss. | 100% data integrity across 100 generated documents with diverse data sets. |


**4. Compatibility and Integration Criteria**

| Criterion ID | Description | Validation Method | Test Scenarios | Success Metrics | Failure Conditions | Acceptance Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CI-1.1 | CLI should be compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows operating systems. | Manual testing on different OS environments. | 1. Run the CLI on different OS versions. 2. Verify functionality and absence of OS-specific errors. | Successful execution on all target OS versions. | OS-specific errors, functional failures on any target OS. | Successful execution on at least three versions of each target OS. |
| CI-2.1 | System should support the latest versions of Node.js and npm specified in the project metadata. | Version checks and testing on specified versions. | 1. Install and run the system with the specified versions. 2.

**5. Quality and Maintainability Criteria**

| Criterion ID | Description | Validation Method | Test Scenarios | Success Metrics | Failure Conditions | Acceptance Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QM-1.1 | Code coverage should be at least 80%. | Code coverage tools (e.g., SonarQube, Jest coverage) | 1. Run unit and integration tests. 2. Analyze code coverage reports. | Code coverage â‰¥ 80%. | Code coverage < 80%. |  Minimum 80% code coverage for all critical components. |
| QM-2.1 | Comprehensive documentation (README, API docs, etc.) should be provided. | Manual review of documentation | 1. Review all documentation for completeness, clarity, and accuracy. |  All documentation complete and easily understandable. | Missing documentation, unclear instructions, inaccuracies. | All documentation complete, accurate, and correctly formatted. |


**Validation Methods and Test Scenarios Summary:**

All criteria will be validated using a combination of automated and manual testing methods.  Automated testing will primarily focus on API functionality and performance, leveraging tools like Postman, REST-assured, JMeter, and k6.  Manual testing will be used for CLI functionality, usability, and documentation review.  Integration tests will verify interactions between different system components.  Success metrics are quantitative wherever possible to ensure objective measurement of criterion satisfaction.  Failure conditions are defined to clearly identify situations where criteria are not met. Acceptance thresholds define the minimum acceptable levels of performance and quality.  Detailed test cases will be documented separately.

**Note:** This is a template.  Specific test scenarios and success metrics need to be further detailed based on the actual implementation and design of the RGA. The lack of security requirements significantly reduces the scope of security-related acceptance criteria.  This should be reviewed and expanded if security requirements change.
