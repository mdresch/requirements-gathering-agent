**7. Validation Methods and Test Scenarios (Summary)**

Validation methods and test scenarios are detailed within each section above.  Success metrics, failure conditions, and acceptance thresholds are also provided for each criterion.  Automated testing should be prioritized wherever possible. Manual testing and user feedback should supplement automated testing to ensure comprehensive validation.  A detailed test plan with specific test cases should be created based on these criteria.  This plan should also outline the test environment setup, test data, and reporting procedures.


This comprehensive set of technical acceptance criteria provides a solid foundation for developing, testing, and deploying a high-quality, reliable, and secure ADPA system.  Remember that these are examples, and specific acceptance thresholds might need adjustment based on project priorities and resource constraints.  Further refinement is encouraged during the project lifecycle.
