**7. Validation Methods and Test Scenarios (Summary)**

The above tables already outline the validation methods and test scenarios for each criterion.  Detailed test cases will be documented in separate test plans.  Success metrics are quantifiable and provide clear pass/fail criteria.  Failure conditions define specific situations leading to criterion failure.  Acceptance thresholds specify minimum acceptable performance or quality levels.  Automated testing will be prioritized where possible, with manual testing used for aspects requiring human judgment (e.g., UI/UX, accessibility).  A comprehensive test suite, including unit, integration, system, performance, security, and user acceptance tests, will be developed and executed.  The testing strategy will be documented in a separate Test Strategy and Test Plan document.
