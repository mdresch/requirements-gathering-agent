|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FC-API-1 | `/api/v1/health` endpoint functionality | Returns a JSON object with `status`, `timestamp`, `version`, `environment`, `uptime` (in seconds), `memory` (used, total, external), and `node` version.  All values must be valid and reflect the current system state. | 1. GET request to `/api/v1/health`. 2.

The generated document (accessible via subsequent endpoints) must be a valid, structured document conforming to BABOK v3.  Handles invalid input gracefully with appropriate error codes and messages. | 1. POST request with valid Fortune 500 data. 2. POST request with malformed JSON. 3.

**7. Validation Methods and Test Scenarios (Summary)**

All criteria above specify validation methods and test scenarios.  Automated testing will be prioritized wherever possible using tools like Postman, Cypress, k6, JMeter, and SonarQube. Manual testing and code reviews will supplement automated testing for areas requiring human judgment (e.g., document quality, usability).  Success metrics are quantitatively defined for each criterion, allowing for objective assessment of system readiness.  Failure conditions clearly define unacceptable outcomes, and acceptance thresholds set minimum acceptable levels of performance and quality.  A comprehensive test plan will be developed detailing all test cases and procedures.


This detailed breakdown provides a robust framework for development and testing, ensuring that the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent meets all specified technical requirements.  Regular review and updates to these criteria will be necessary as the project evolves.
