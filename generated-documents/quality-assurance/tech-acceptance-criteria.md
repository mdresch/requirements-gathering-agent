## Technical Acceptance Criteria: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines the technical acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Criteria are categorized for clarity and testability.  Each criterion includes validation methods, test scenarios, success metrics, failure conditions, and acceptance thresholds.

**System Overview:** ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI (specifically Azure OpenAI, with fallback options) to generate project documentation based on provided context (primarily README.md and associated project files).  It generates PMBOK-compliant documents, technical design documents, and strategic business communications.

### 7. Validation Methods and Test Scenarios (Summary)

The validation methods and test scenarios listed above provide a comprehensive approach to verifying the system's functionality, performance, security, and reliability.  These methods should be used in conjunction with a well-defined test plan that includes detailed test cases, data sets, and expected results.  Automated testing should be prioritized wherever possible to ensure efficient and repeatable validation.  Manual testing should be used to supplement automated testing and address areas that are difficult to automate.  Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines should be implemented to automate the testing and deployment process.


This detailed breakdown of technical acceptance criteria provides a solid foundation for development and testing teams to build and validate the ADPA system effectively.  Regular review and updates to this document are crucial throughout the project lifecycle to reflect evolving requirements and identified issues.
