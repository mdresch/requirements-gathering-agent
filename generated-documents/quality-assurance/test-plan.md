# Test Plan: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project.  It aims to ensure the quality, reliability, and safety of the vehicle and its integrated systems.

* **Scope:** This test plan covers the testing of all core SCEV components and their integration: advanced photovoltaic body panels, regenerative suspension system, thermoelectric generation (TEG) units, and the AI-powered Energy Management Unit (EMU).  Testing will encompass functional, performance, security, and usability aspects.  The initial prototype and test mule phases are included within this plan.

* **Objectives:** To verify that the SCEV meets its design specifications, performs as expected under various conditions, and is safe and reliable for use.  Specific objectives include validating energy harvesting efficiency, EMU functionality, system integration, and user experience.

* **Project Background:** The SCEV project aims to develop an electric vehicle that significantly reduces reliance on traditional charging infrastructure by harvesting ambient energy.  This involves integrating multiple energy-harvesting technologies controlled by an AI-powered energy management system.

* **Test Plan Assumptions:**  Access to the necessary hardware (prototype components, test mule vehicle), software (EMU software, simulation tools), and testing environments will be available as per the project schedule.  The development team will provide timely bug fixes and updated builds. Sufficient test data will be available for comprehensive testing.

* **Constraints:** The project timeline is tight.  Resource availability (testers, equipment) may be limited. The availability of specific weather conditions for solar panel testing might be a constraint.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features/Modules to be Tested:**
    * Advanced Photovoltaic Body Panels:  Energy generation under various light conditions, durability, efficiency, and integration with the EMU.
    * Regenerative Suspension System: Energy generation under various road conditions, efficiency, reliability, and integration with the EMU.
    * Thermoelectric Generation (TEG) Units: Energy generation based on temperature differentials, efficiency, reliability, and integration with the EMU.
    * AI-Powered Energy Management Unit (EMU): Data acquisition, energy flow optimization, predictive modeling, user interface, and overall system control.
    * Vehicle Integration:  Seamless operation of all components, data communication, and overall vehicle performance.


* **Version Identification:**  Prototype v1.0, Test Mule Build 1.0 (subject to change based on development milestones).

* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  The EMU is dependent on data from all three energy harvesting systems.  Each energy harvesting system is dependent on its own specific sensors and control mechanisms. The overall system is dependent on the vehicle's electrical system and battery.


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:**
    * **Unit Testing:** Individual component testing (solar panels, shock absorbers, TEG units, EMU modules).
    * **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between individual components.
    * **System Testing:** Testing the entire SCEV system (all components integrated).
    * **Acceptance Testing:** User acceptance testing and verification against requirements.

* **Testing Types:**
    * **Functional Testing:** Verification of functionality according to specifications.
    * **Performance Testing:**  Measurement of energy generation efficiency, energy storage capacity, and charging time.
    * **Security Testing:**  Assessment of system vulnerabilities and data security. (Limited scope in initial phases)
    * **Usability Testing:**  Evaluation of the user interface and overall user experience.
    * **Endurance Testing:** Testing the system's ability to withstand prolonged usage and various environmental conditions.

* **Test Design Techniques:**  Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, use case testing.

* **Automation Strategy:**  Test automation will be prioritized for repetitive tests (e.g., performance testing).  Selenium or Appium (depending on the UI framework) will be considered for UI test automation.  Python with appropriate libraries will be used for API and back-end testing.


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Prototype components, test mule vehicle, data acquisition equipment, climate-controlled testing chambers (for temperature testing), various road surfaces for testing the regenerative suspension.

* **Software:**  EMU software, simulation software, test management tool (e.g., Jira), defect tracking system (e.g., Jira), test automation framework (Selenium/Appium/Python).

* **Test Data:**  Weather data, road profile data, driving patterns, battery charge levels, temperature data.  Data generation and management plan will be developed.

* **Environment Setup:** Detailed procedures for setting up and configuring the test environments will be documented.

* **Access Requirements:**  Access control to test environments and data will be managed through appropriate security measures.
