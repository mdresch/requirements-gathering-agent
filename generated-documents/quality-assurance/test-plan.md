# Test Plan: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the testing strategy and plan for the ADPA framework, ensuring its quality, functionality, performance, and security before release.
* **Scope:** This plan covers testing of all core ADPA components: CLI, REST API, Admin Web Interface, AI integrations (Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama), and integrations with Confluence and SharePoint.  Specific document generation features for BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 will be rigorously tested.  Security and performance testing will be included.
* **Objectives:** To verify that ADPA meets functional, non-functional, and security requirements; to identify and track defects; and to ensure a high-quality product release.
* **Project Background:** ADPA is a modular, enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation.  It supports multiple AI providers and integrates with various enterprise systems.
* **Test Plan Assumptions:**  Access to all necessary test environments (development, staging, production-like) will be provided.  The required test data will be available or easily generated.  The development team will promptly address identified defects.
* **Constraints:** The testing timeline is constrained by the overall project schedule.  Resource availability may limit the extent of automated testing.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features/Modules to be Tested:**
    * CLI: All commands (generate, api:start, confluence init, sharepoint init, etc.) including error handling and help documentation.
    * REST API: All endpoints (generate, templates, confluence/publish, sharepoint/upload, frameworks, etc.) including authentication, authorization, and data validation.  OpenAPI specification compliance.
    * Admin Web Interface: Navigation, configuration settings, user management, and data visualization.
    * AI Integrations:  Successful document generation with each provider (Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama) including fallback mechanisms. Accurate and relevant content generation.
    * Confluence Integration:  Successful document publishing and authentication.
    * SharePoint Integration: Successful document upload and authentication.
    * BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0 document generation:  Accuracy, completeness, and adherence to framework standards.
    * Authentication and Authorization:  Secure access control, role-based permissions, and MFA (if implemented).
* **Version Identification:**  3.2.9 (as stated in project metadata) â€“  Specific build number will be determined closer to testing.
* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  All integrations (AI providers, Confluence, SharePoint) will be tested for successful interaction and data exchange.


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:** Unit, Integration, System, User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
* **Testing Types:** Functional, Performance, Security, Usability.
* **Test Design Techniques:** Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, state transition testing, use case testing.
* **Automation Strategy:**  Selenium (for UI testing), REST Assured or similar (for API testing), and Jest (for unit tests).  Prioritize automated tests for regression testing.
* **Tool Selection:** Selenium, REST Assured/Postman, Jest, JMeter (for performance testing), SonarQube (for code quality analysis).


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Sufficiently powerful machines for each test environment (development, staging, UAT).  Specifications to be determined based on anticipated load.
* **Software:** Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5.7+, required dependencies (listed in project metadata), test automation tools, database instances (if applicable), Confluence and SharePoint instances for integration testing.
* **Test Data Requirements:**  Realistic test data reflecting diverse scenarios and edge cases.  Data generation scripts will be developed to ensure consistent and repeatable testing.  Data masking techniques will be used where necessary.
* **Environment Setup:**  Detailed setup instructions will be documented for each environment.  Configuration management tools will be used to maintain consistency.
* **Access Requirements:**  Secure access control to test environments will be implemented using appropriate credentials and access management systems.
