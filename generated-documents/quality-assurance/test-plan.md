# Test Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, version 2.2.0.  It serves as a guide for the testing team and ensures consistent and comprehensive testing throughout the project lifecycle.

* **Scope:** This test plan covers the functional, non-functional, and integration testing of the RGA application, including its CLI, API, and integration with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).  It specifically excludes security testing, as explicitly stated in the project requirements (PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD).

* **Objectives:** To verify that the RGA application meets the specified functional and non-functional requirements, identify and report defects, and ensure the application is ready for release.  The primary focus is on ensuring the quality of generated documents and the stability of the application.

* **Project Background:** The RGA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  It utilizes various AI providers and aims to streamline the requirements gathering process.

* **Assumptions:**  The development team will provide stable build releases according to the schedule.  Necessary test environments will be available as per the timelines defined below.  All required documentation (including API specifications) will be readily available.

* **Constraints:**  The testing timeline is constrained by the overall project schedule.  Security testing is explicitly out of scope.  Resource availability may limit the extent of automated testing.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features to be Tested:**
    * CLI functionality (including command parsing, configuration management, and output handling).
    * API functionality (including health checks, template management, document generation, and provider selection).
    * Integration with all supported AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).  Testing will focus on successful document generation and error handling for each provider.
    * Document generation quality (PMBOK compliance, accuracy, completeness, and formatting).
    * Performance testing (response times for API calls and document generation).
    * Usability testing (ease of use of the CLI and clarity of generated documents).

* **Version Identification:** 2.2.0

* **Build Information:**  To be determined for each test cycle.

* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  The application depends on several external libraries and APIs (listed in the project metadata). Integration points include the various AI providers and potential future integrations with third-party project management tools.


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:**
    * Unit Testing (Developer responsibility, using Jest)
    * Integration Testing (Testing team responsibility)
    * System Testing (Testing team responsibility)
    * User Acceptance Testing (UAT) (Stakeholder responsibility)

* **Testing Types:**
    * Functional Testing: Verification of all features listed above.
    * Performance Testing: Load testing and response time measurement of API calls and document generation.
    * Usability Testing: Assessment of the user experience with the CLI.
    * Regression Testing: Repeated testing after code changes to ensure no new defects are introduced.

* **Test Design Techniques:**  Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, and use case testing will be employed.

* **Automation Strategy:**  Test automation will be prioritized for regression testing and API testing using tools such as Jest, Cypress, or similar.  The extent of automation will be determined based on resource availability and prioritization.


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Sufficiently powered machines to handle the execution of the application and the running of tests.  Specifications will be determined based on the expected load during testing.

* **Software:**  Node.js, relevant AI provider SDKs, and testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress, etc.).  Specific versions will be documented.

* **Test Data:**  Sample project data, including requirements, project descriptions, and other input necessary for document generation.  Data masking techniques will be employed to ensure data privacy where applicable.

* **Environment Setup:**  Detailed setup instructions will be provided to the testing team. This will include setting up the application, configuring the different AI providers, and preparing the test data.

* **Access Requirements:**  Access to the test environment and relevant tools will be provided to the testing team.
