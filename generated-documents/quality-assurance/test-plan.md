# Test Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Expert Test Manager


## 1. Test Plan Overview

**1.1 Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) software.  It provides a comprehensive guide for the testing team to ensure the quality and functionality of ADPA before release.

**1.2 Scope:** This plan covers the testing of all ADPA features, including PMBOK document generation, technical design document generation, strategic statement generation, CLI functionality, and the enhanced context manager.  It excludes testing of third-party APIs (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) unless their integration with ADPA is explicitly being tested.

**1.3 Objectives:** To verify that ADPA meets the defined functional and non-functional requirements, identify and track defects, and ensure the software is ready for release.  Specific objectives include:

* Verify the accuracy and completeness of generated documents.
* Validate PMBOK 7.0 compliance of generated documents.
* Confirm the functionality and usability of the CLI.
* Assess the performance and scalability of the system.
* Ensure security and data privacy.
* Verify the effectiveness of the enhanced context manager.
* Evaluate the user experience.


**1.4 Project Background:** ADPA is an AI-powered tool that automates the generation of project management documentation based on input from a project's README file and other associated documentation. It utilizes multiple AI providers and adheres to PMBOK 7.0 standards.

**1.5 Assumptions:**

* Access to necessary testing environments (hardware and software) will be provided.
* Test data representing a variety of project scenarios will be available.
* The development team will promptly address identified defects.
* Stakeholders will be available for acceptance testing.

**1.6 Constraints:**

* Limited testing time due to project deadlines.
* Reliance on the availability of third-party AI APIs.
* Potential limitations in testing the full range of possible project inputs.


## 2. Test Items and Features

**2.1 Test Items:** ADPA software, version 2.1.3-prerelease (or latest stable version at test commencement).

**2.2 Features to be Tested:**

* **PMBOK Document Generation:**  All 29 PMBOK documents listed in the README.
* **Technical Design Document Generation:** All 10 technical document types.
* **Strategic Statement Generation:**  Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.
* **CLI Functionality:** All CLI commands and options, including validation and context management options.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:**  Context utilization, 3-phase strategy, and reporting.
* **Version Control System (VCS):**  Git integration for generated documents (if enabled).
* **Multi-Provider Support:** Testing with Azure OpenAI, potentially Google AI and others if implemented.
* **Error Handling and Recovery:**  Robustness in handling invalid inputs and API failures.
* **Document Validation:** PMBOK compliance and quality assessment.


**2.3 Version Identification:**  As specified in the project README (2.1.3-prerelease).  This should be updated to reflect the specific build used for testing.

**2.4 Dependencies:**  Node.js, Azure OpenAI (or other selected AI providers), Azure CLI (for Entra ID authentication).

**2.5 Integration Points:**  Integration with various AI providers, file system for input/output.


## 3. Test Approach and Strategy

**3.1 Testing Levels:**

* **Unit Testing:** (Already performed by developers) Verification of individual modules and functions.
* **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different modules and components.
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete ADPA system.
* **Acceptance Testing:** Verification by stakeholders that the system meets their requirements.

**3.2 Testing Types:**

* **Functional Testing:** Verification that all features function as specified in the requirements.
* **Performance Testing:** Evaluation of response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
* **Security Testing:** Assessment of vulnerabilities and data protection.
* **Usability Testing:**  Evaluation of user-friendliness and ease of use of the CLI.
* **Regression Testing:**  Retesting after bug fixes to ensure no new issues are introduced.


**3.3 Test Design Techniques:**

* **Equivalence Partitioning:** Dividing inputs into groups that are expected to be processed similarly.
* **Boundary Value Analysis:**  Testing values at the edges of input ranges.
* **Use Case Testing:**  Testing the system based on user scenarios.
* **Error Guessing:**  Identifying potential failure points based on experience.


**3.4 Automation Strategy:**  Test automation will be prioritized for regression testing and repetitive tasks using a suitable framework (e.g., Jest, Cypress).  The scope of automation will be defined based on available resources and time constraints.


## 4. Test Environment Requirements

**4.1 Hardware:**  Sufficiently powerful machine to handle ADPA execution and testing workload.  Specific requirements will depend on performance testing needs.

**4.2 Software:** Node.js, necessary AI provider SDKs, Git, test automation framework.

**4.3 Test Data:**  A comprehensive suite of test data representing various project types, sizes, and complexities. This will include both valid and invalid inputs to test error handling.  Test data will be managed using a version control system.

**4.4 Environment Setup:**  Detailed instructions for setting up the test environment will be provided to the test team.  This will include steps for installing necessary software, configuring AI provider access, and setting up test data.

**4.5 Access Requirements and Security Considerations:**  Access to test environments will be controlled, and appropriate security measures will be implemented.
