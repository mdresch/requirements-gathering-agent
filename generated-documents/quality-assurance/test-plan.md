## 1. Test Plan Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
This test plan defines the testing scope, approach, resources, schedule, deliverables, and risk management strategies for the ADPA Enterprise Automation Framework (v3.2.0). The plan ensures delivery of a secure, reliable, and standards-compliant automation platform for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.

### 1.2 Scope & Objectives
- **In Scope:**  
  - Functional, integration, security, performance, and usability testing of CLI, REST API, Admin Web Interface, and core modules (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK, AI provider integration, Adobe/Confluence/SharePoint connectors).
  - Verification of compliance with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Ed., and DMBOK 2.0 (where implemented).
  - End-to-end testing of document generation pipelines and enterprise integrations.

- **Out of Scope:**  
  - DMBOK 2.0 modules not yet implemented.
  - Mobile application support (future roadmap).

- **Objectives:**  
  - Validate all core features against requirements and standards.
  - Ensure system is production-ready, secure, and performant.
  - Guarantee integrations (Adobe, Confluence, SharePoint, AI providers) function reliably.
  - Achieve defined quality and compliance criteria prior to release.

### 1.3 Project Background & Context
ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript enterprise framework offering automated, AI-powered document generation and project management. It supports both CLI and REST API interfaces, integrates with leading enterprise platforms, and is designed for Fortune 500-scale deployments.

### 1.4 Assumptions & Constraints
- All test environments mirror production configurations.
- Test data is anonymized and compliant with data protection regulations.
- Third-party API keys and credentials are available for testing.
- Some features (e.g., DMBOK 2.0) are partially implemented and will be tested as available.
- Enterprise integrations (Adobe, Confluence, SharePoint) test accounts are provisioned.

- **Integration Testing:** API endpoints, CLI commands, module interconnections, provider fallbacks.
- **System Testing:** End-to-end workflows (document generation, publishing, compliance).
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Business scenarios, enterprise use cases, standards compliance.

### 3.2 Testing Types
- **Functional:** Requirement coverage, business rules, standards compliance (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
- **Performance:** API throughput, response times, concurrent user handling, document generation speed.
- **Security:** Auth flows, permission checks, OWASP vulnerabilities, API key/JWT handling, rate limiting.
- **Usability:** CLI experience, web UI navigation, API documentation usability.
- **Compatibility:** Node.js/TypeScript versions, browser compatibility (admin portal), cross-platform CLI.
- **Regression:** Automated on each build/release.
- **Integration:** Third-party APIs (Adobe, Confluence, SharePoint), provider switching and failover.

### 3.3 Test Design Techniques & Methodologies
- **Requirement-based Testing:** Direct mapping to user stories and standards.
- **Boundary Value & Equivalence Partitioning:** Input validation, API parameterization.
- **Exploratory Testing:** Ad-hoc scenarios for integrations and edge cases.
- **Data-driven Testing:** Multiple test datasets for document generation and compliance checks.
- **Risk-based Testing:** Prioritize critical business and compliance flows.

### 3.4 Automation Strategy & Tools
- **Unit/Integration Tests:** Jest, ts-jest for automated execution, coverage enforcement.
- **API Automation:** Postman/Newman, supertest for REST API endpoints.
