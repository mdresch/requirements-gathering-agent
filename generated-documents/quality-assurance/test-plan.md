# Test Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA RGA) API.  It serves as a guide for the testing team and ensures comprehensive testing coverage.
* **Scope:** This plan covers functional, performance, security, and usability testing of the ADPA RGA API, including all documented endpoints and features.  It excludes testing of the underlying AI models (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) as those are considered third-party components.  Testing will focus on the API's integration and interaction with these models.
* **Objectives:** To verify the functionality, performance, security, and usability of the ADPA RGA API, ensuring it meets the defined requirements and provides a reliable and efficient service.  The goal is to identify and report any defects before release to production.
* **Project Background:** The ADPA RGA is a revolutionary API designed to automate business analysis processes, generating BABOK v3 compliant documentation. It leverages multiple AI providers and offers features such as template management and real-time job tracking.
* **Assumptions:**  The development team will provide stable build releases according to the schedule.  Necessary test environments (hardware, software, data) will be available as planned.  Third-party AI APIs will be accessible and functional during testing.
* **Constraints:** The testing timeline is constrained by the overall project schedule.  Resource availability may limit the extent of automated testing.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features/Modules to be Tested:**
    * **Document Generation API:**  `/api/v1/documents/convert`, `/api/v1/documents/jobs`, `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`, `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}` (including different document types: PDF, DOCX, HTML)
    * **Template Management API:** `/api/v1/templates` (POST, GET, PUT)
    * **Health Check Endpoints:** `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/health/ready`
    * **Authentication & Authorization:** API key authentication, JWT (if implemented).
    * **Error Handling:**  Comprehensive error handling and responses.
    * **Rate Limiting:**  Testing the effectiveness of rate limiting mechanisms.
    * **Input Validation:** Testing validation of input data using Zod schemas.
    * **SharePoint Integration (if applicable):**  Testing the publishing of documents to SharePoint.


* **Version Identification:**  ADPA RGA API - Version 3.1.1 (or latest stable build)
* **Build Information:** To be provided by the development team for each testing phase.
* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  Third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), database, file system, SharePoint (if applicable).


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:** Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance (UAT).
* **Testing Types:**
    * **Functional Testing:** Verify that all API endpoints function as specified in the API documentation.
    * **Performance Testing:**  Assess response times, throughput, and scalability under varying loads.  Tools like JMeter or k6 will be used.
    * **Security Testing:**  Penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).  This might involve third-party security experts.
    * **Usability Testing:** Evaluate the ease of use of the API and its documentation.
    * **Regression Testing:**  Ensure that new code changes don't introduce regressions in existing functionality.
* **Test Design Techniques:** Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, state transition testing.
* **Automation Strategy:**  API testing will be primarily automated using tools like Postman, REST-assured (Java), or pytest (Python).  Test automation framework will be established.
* **Tool Selection:** Postman (initial testing and exploratory),  Jest/Cypress (unit/integration), JMeter/k6 (Performance),  Security testing tools (to be determined based on budget and scope).


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Sufficiently powerful machines for running tests and API server.  Specifications to be defined.
* **Software:**  Node.js, required dependencies, testing frameworks, Postman, JMeter/k6 (or alternatives), database server (if applicable).
* **Test Data:**  Realistic test data representing various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  Fortune 500 data samples will be used.
* **Environment Setup:** Detailed instructions for setting up the test environment will be provided to the testing team.  Docker containers will be explored for consistent environments.
* **Access Requirements:**  Secure access to the test environment and API will be granted to authorized personnel only.
