# Test Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) software.  It serves as a guide for the testing team and provides a framework for ensuring the quality and reliability of the software.

* **Scope:** This plan covers the functional, performance, security, and usability testing of ADPA version 2.1.3, including all features and modules as described in the project README and associated documentation.  This includes the core PMBOK document generation, the new Technical Design Document System, Strategic Document Generation, and the enhanced context manager.  It excludes testing of third-party libraries unless their integration with ADPA is directly impacting functionality.

* **Objectives:** To verify that ADPA meets all functional and non-functional requirements, identify and resolve defects, and ensure the software is ready for release.  Specific objectives include achieving 95% test case coverage, a defect density of less than 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code, and positive user feedback during usability testing.

* **Project Background:** ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to automate the creation of project management documentation based on PMBOK standards.  It utilizes various AI providers and employs advanced context management techniques.

* **Test Plan Assumptions:**
    * The development team will provide stable build releases according to the schedule.
    * Necessary test environments will be available and configured as specified.
    * Test data will be provided or generated as needed.
    * The testing team possesses the required skills and experience.

* **Constraints:**
    * Limited testing time allocated.
    * Dependence on the availability of AI services (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
    * Resource limitations may necessitate prioritization of testing efforts.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features to be Tested:**
    * Core PMBOK Document Generation (all 29 document types)
    * Technical Design Document Generation (all 10 document types)
    * Strategic Document Generation (Purpose Statement, Company Values, etc.)
    * Enhanced Context Manager (3-phase context strategy, multi-provider support)
    * CLI Interface (all commands and options)
    * PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation
    * Version Control System (local git repository management)
    * SharePoint and Confluence Integrations (if applicable and within scope)
    * Error Handling and Logging
    * Authentication mechanisms (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama)


* **Version Identification:** ADPA 2.1.3

* **Build Information:**  To be determined for each test cycle.

* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama APIs; Node.js; TypeScript;  SharePoint and Confluence APIs (if applicable).


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:** Unit, Integration, System, User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

* **Testing Types:**
    * Functional Testing: Verify all features function as specified in the requirements.
    * Performance Testing: Assess response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
    * Security Testing: Evaluate vulnerabilities and ensure data security.
    * Usability Testing: Assess ease of use and user experience.
    * Regression Testing: Verify that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.  This will be performed after each significant code change.
    * Compliance Testing: Verify adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards.

* **Test Design Techniques:** Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, decision table testing, state transition testing, use case testing.

* **Automation Strategy:**  Selenium or Cypress for UI testing (if applicable), Jest for unit testing, and custom scripts for API and performance testing.  Prioritize automation of regression tests.

* **Tool Selection:**  Jest, Selenium/Cypress, JMeter (or similar performance testing tool), Postman (or similar API testing tool).


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Multiple machines with sufficient processing power and memory to handle the demands of the application and testing tools.  Specific requirements will be determined based on performance testing results.

* **Software:**
    * Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
    * Necessary AI provider SDKs and APIs (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
    * Testing tools (Jest, Selenium/Cypress, JMeter, Postman)
    * Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Linux (as applicable)
    * Database (if applicable)

* **Test Data Requirements:**  Sample project README files with varying complexity and content will be used.  Synthetic data may be generated for performance testing.  Test data will be managed using a dedicated repository.

* **Environment Setup:** Detailed instructions for setting up the test environment will be provided to the test team.

* **Access Requirements and Security Considerations:** Access to test environments and data will be controlled and secured according to organizational policies.
