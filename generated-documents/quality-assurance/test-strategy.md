# Test Strategy: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Quality Assurance Manager


## 1. Testing Objectives and Goals

The primary objective is to ensure the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) meets all functional and non-functional requirements, delivering a high-quality, reliable, and secure solution for generating enterprise-grade business analysis documents.  Specific goals include:

* **Functional Correctness:** Verify the accurate generation of PMBOK and BABOK compliant documents based on diverse input data.  All API endpoints must function as specified in the API documentation.
* **Performance Efficiency:**  Document generation must be completed within acceptable timeframes (defined as <2 seconds for typical scenarios, with documented exceptions and performance testing thresholds).
* **Security Robustness:**  Validate the security of API endpoints, including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
* **Usability:**  The CLI interface should be intuitive and easy to use for both technical and non-technical users.
* **Scalability:** The system should handle a reasonable load of concurrent requests without performance degradation.
* **Data Integrity:** Generated documents must be consistent, accurate, and free of errors.
* **Compliance:** Ensure adherence to relevant standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK, GDPR, etc., as applicable).

**Success Metrics:**

* Percentage of passed test cases (target: >95%)
* Number of critical and high-severity defects found and resolved (target: 0)
* Average document generation time (target: <2 seconds)
* API response times (target: <500ms for most requests)
* Security vulnerability scan results (target: 0 critical vulnerabilities)
* User satisfaction score (based on usability testing)


## 2. Test Scope and Approach

**In-Scope:**

* All API endpoints (Document Generation, Template Management, etc.)
* CLI interface functionality
* Document generation accuracy and completeness
* Performance testing under various load conditions
* Security testing (authentication, authorization, vulnerability scanning)
* Usability testing of the CLI
* Integration testing with external services (AI providers, SharePoint, etc.)
* Compatibility testing across different operating systems and environments.


**Out-of-Scope:**

* Testing of third-party libraries and services (unless their integration with the ADPA is faulty).
* Performance testing under extreme load conditions beyond realistic usage scenarios.
* Penetration testing (unless specifically requested).
* Load testing for specific integrations (Sharepoint, Confluence) which will be covered in separate integration test plans.


**Test Levels:**

* **Unit Testing:** Individual components and modules will be tested using unit tests.
* **Integration Testing:**  Testing interactions between different components and modules.
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete system, including API and CLI.
* **Acceptance Testing:** User acceptance testing (UAT) to validate system functionality against business requirements.


**Testing Types:**

* **Functional Testing:** Verify that all features work as specified.
* **Non-functional Testing:**  Performance, security, usability, compatibility, and scalability testing.
* **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing.
* **Security Testing:**  Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing (if applicable), and security audits.
* **Compatibility Testing:** Testing on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), browsers, and database versions.
* **Usability Testing:**  Evaluate the ease of use and user experience of the CLI.


**Risk-Based Testing Priorities:**

High priority will be given to testing critical functionalities, security aspects, and performance bottlenecks identified during risk assessment.


## 3. Test Environment Strategy

**Test Environment Requirements:**

* **Development Environment:** For initial testing and debugging.
* **Testing Environment:**  A dedicated environment mirroring the production environment for system, integration, and performance testing.
* **Staging Environment:**  A near-production environment for UAT and final validation.

**Test Data Management:**

* Synthetic test data will be generated to cover various scenarios and edge cases.
* Real-world data (sanitized and anonymized) from the Fortune 500 GlobalBank case study will be used for realistic testing.
* A data masking strategy will be implemented to protect sensitive information.

**Environment Dependencies:**

* Access to all required API keys and credentials for external services (AI providers, SharePoint, etc.).
* Network connectivity to all external services.
* Database servers (if applicable).

**Environment Setup, Maintenance, and Refresh Procedures:**  Documented procedures will be followed for setting up, maintaining, and refreshing test environments.


## 4. Test Organization and Roles

**Testing Team Structure:**

* **Test Lead:** Responsible for overall test planning, execution, and reporting.
* **Test Engineers:** Responsible for designing, developing, and executing test cases.
* **Automation Engineer:** Responsible for developing and maintaining automated test scripts.
* **Usability Tester:**  Conducts usability testing to evaluate the CLI.
* **Security Tester:**  Performs security testing and vulnerability assessments.

**Required Skills and Competencies:**

* Strong understanding of software testing methodologies and principles.
* Experience with API testing tools (Postman, REST-assured, etc.).
* Experience with performance testing tools (JMeter, LoadRunner, etc.).
* Experience with security testing tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, etc.).
* Proficiency in scripting languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
* Knowledge of BABOK and PMBOK methodologies (desirable).


**Communication Protocols and Reporting Structures:** Daily stand-up meetings, weekly status reports, and defect tracking system will be used for communication and reporting.


## 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Potential Risks:**

* **Technical Risks:** Integration issues with external services, unexpected bugs, performance bottlenecks.
* **Resource Risks:** Lack of skilled testers, insufficient time, inadequate test environment resources.
* **Schedule Risks:** Delays in development or testing activities.
* **Quality Risks:**  Failure to meet quality requirements, insufficient test coverage.

**Risk Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Thorough integration testing, proactive bug fixing, performance testing, and regular code reviews.
* **Resource Risks:**  Effective resource allocation, prioritization of testing activities, and use of automation.
* **Schedule Risks:**  Detailed test planning, risk management, and contingency planning.
* **Quality Risks:**  Comprehensive test coverage, peer reviews, and regular quality assurance checks.


**Risk Monitoring and Escalation Procedures:**  Regular risk assessment meetings and escalation procedures will be defined to address potential issues promptly.
