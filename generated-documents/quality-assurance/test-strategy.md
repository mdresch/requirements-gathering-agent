- Performance and scalability testing for microservices and REST API endpoints.  
- Usability testing of CLI interactive menu and Admin web portal.  
- Compliance validations for GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III, MiFID II.  

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope  
- Third-party AI provider internal functionality and availability beyond integration points.  
- Underlying infrastructure provisioning (Kubernetes, Docker container orchestration) beyond test environment setup.  
- Non-enterprise deployment scenarios or unsupported legacy platforms.  

### 2.3 Test Levels  
- **Unit Testing:** Component-level code validation using Jest and ts-jest.  
- **Integration Testing:** Interaction between modules, API endpoints, and AI service integrations.  
- **System Testing:** End-to-end workflows including document generation pipelines and enterprise integrations.  
- **Acceptance Testing:** Business-driven tests validating compliance with BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK requirements and stakeholder expectations.  

### 2.4 Testing Types  
- **Functional Testing:** Verification of all documented features and workflows.  
- **Non-functional Testing:** Performance, security, usability, compatibility, and compliance testing.  
- **Performance Testing:** Load, stress, and scalability tests on API endpoints and AI processing engine.  
- **Security Testing:** Penetration tests, vulnerability scans, authentication and authorization validation.  
- **Compatibility Testing:** Validation across supported Node.js versions (≥18), TypeScript builds, browsers for admin UI (latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge).  
- **Usability Testing:** CLI interactive menu flow, admin portal UX heuristics, accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1 AA).  
- **Regression Testing:** Automated test suites triggered on CI/CD pipelines for every build.  

### 2.5 Risk-Based Testing Priorities  
- High priority on AI provider failover and integration reliability due to critical business impact.  
- Security and compliance testing prioritized given enterprise regulatory requirements.  
- Performance testing prioritized for API endpoints handling document generation at scale.  
- Usability testing priority on admin interface and CLI given diverse user base.  
- Lower priority on legacy or deprecated features unless critical defects reported.
