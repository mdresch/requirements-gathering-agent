# Test Strategy: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) - Version 2.2.0

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Prepared by:** Expert QA Manager

**1. Testing Objectives and Goals:**

* **Objective 1:** Verify the successful generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation (charters, registers, plans, etc.) with high accuracy and completeness.  Success will be measured by a defect rate of less than 2% in generated documents and 100% passing rate for unit and integration tests related to document generation.
* **Objective 2:** Ensure the system's performance meets the defined thresholds for response time and resource utilization under expected load. Success will be measured by average response times under 5 seconds for document generation and less than 10% CPU utilization during peak load testing.
* **Objective 3:** Validate the system's compatibility with different AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) and its ability to seamlessly switch between providers. Success will be measured by successful document generation across all supported providers with no functional discrepancies.
* **Objective 4:** Confirm the usability and ease of use of the CLI interface.  Success will be measured by a user satisfaction score of at least 4 out of 5 based on feedback from a usability testing session.
* **Objective 5:**  Ensure that the API meets defined security standards, although explicit security requirements are not mandated in current scope.  Success will be measured by successful completion of penetration testing (if applicable) and absence of critical vulnerabilities.


**2. Test Scope and Approach:**

* **In-Scope:**  All functional and non-functional requirements as defined in the provided documentation (including CLI, API, document generation, AI provider integration).  This includes unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
* **Out-of-Scope:**  Formal security penetration testing (unless explicitly requested and budgeted), compliance testing against specific regulations (beyond basic PMBOK compliance), and testing for features explicitly marked as "Not Needed" or "Out of Scope" in the provided documentation.

* **Test Levels:**
    * **Unit Testing:**  Focus on individual modules and functions (e.g., AI interaction, document templating, schema validation).
    * **Integration Testing:** Verify the interaction between different modules and components.
    * **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete system, including the CLI and API.
    * **Acceptance Testing:** User acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the system meets user needs and expectations.

* **Testing Types:**
    * **Functional Testing:** Verify system functionality against requirements.
    * **Non-Functional Testing:** Performance, usability, compatibility, and reliability testing.
    * **Performance Testing:** Load testing and stress testing to evaluate system performance under various conditions.
    * **Security Testing:** Basic security checks (vulnerability scans if resources allow) to identify potential vulnerabilities.  This will be limited in scope due to the explicit exclusion of extensive security requirements.
    * **Compatibility Testing:** Test compatibility with different operating systems, AI providers, and hardware configurations.
    * **Usability Testing:** Evaluate the ease of use of the CLI interface.


**3. Test Environment Strategy:**

* **Test Environments:** Development, Staging, and UAT environments will be set up mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.
* **Test Data Management:**  Test data will be generated using realistic but anonymized data.  Data privacy will be maintained according to best practices.  Data generation tools (scripts or mock data generators) will be employed.
* **Environment Dependencies:**  All necessary dependencies (AI provider APIs, database connections) will be configured in each environment.  Documentation will detail these dependencies.  Mock services may be utilized where appropriate to isolate testing.


**4. Test Organization and Roles:**

* **Test Lead:** Oversees all testing activities, manages the team, and reports to project management.
* **Test Engineers:** Design, develop, and execute test cases, report defects, and participate in test planning and execution.
* **Developers:**  Participate in unit testing and provide support for defect resolution.
* **Users/Stakeholders:** Participate in UAT to provide feedback on system usability and functionality.

**Communication:** Daily stand-ups, weekly status reports, and defect tracking system will be used for communication.


**5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation:**

| Risk                     | Probability | Impact       | Mitigation Strategy                                                                |
|--------------------------|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AI Provider API Issues    | Medium       | High         | Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms; use mock providers for testing |
| Insufficient Test Data   | Low          | Medium       | Develop automated test data generation scripts                                        |
| Schedule Delays           | Medium       | High         | Prioritize critical testing paths; flexible scheduling                               |
| Inadequate Resource Skills| Low          | Medium       | Provide necessary training and mentorship                                          |


**6. Test Deliverables and Timeline:**

* **Test Plan:**  Detailed test plan outlining the testing approach, scope, and schedule.
* **Test Cases:**  Detailed test cases covering all functional and non-functional requirements.
* **Test Scripts:** Automated test scripts for regression testing.
* **Test Data:**  Test data sets for various testing scenarios.
* **Test Reports:**  Summary reports on test execution, defect tracking, and test coverage.

A detailed timeline will be developed based on the overall project schedule. Entry and exit criteria will be defined for each testing phase.


**7. Tools and Technologies:**

* **Test Management Tool:** Jira (or equivalent) for test case management, defect tracking, and reporting.
* **Test Automation Framework:** Jest (already in use) for unit and integration testing; Cypress or Selenium (depending on API testing needs) for API and UI testing.
* **Performance Testing Tools:** JMeter (or equivalent) for load and stress testing.
* **Defect Tracking System:** Jira (or equivalent).
* **API Testing Tools:** Postman (for manual testing and initial API exploration).


**8. Resource Planning and Budget:**

* **Effort Estimation:**  A detailed effort estimation will be conducted based on the test plan and scope.
* **Resource Allocation:**  The required number of test engineers and their skill sets will be identified.
* **Budget:**  A budget will be allocated for testing tools, training, and potential third-party services (if any).


**9. Quality Metrics and Reporting:**

* **Test Coverage:**  Percentage of requirements covered by test cases.
* **Defect Density:**  Number of defects per lines of code.
* **Defect Severity:**  Classification of defects based on their impact.
* **Test Execution Time:**  Time taken to execute test cases.
* **Performance Metrics:**  Response times, resource utilization, and throughput.

Reports will be generated daily, weekly, and at the end of each testing phase.


**10. Continuous Improvement:**

* **Lessons Learned:**  Regular meetings will be held to capture lessons learned and best practices.
* **Process Improvement:**  The testing process will be continuously reviewed and improved based on feedback and experience.
* **Knowledge Transfer:**  Knowledge will be transferred to other team members through documentation, training, and mentoring.


This Test Strategy provides a high-level framework.  A more detailed Test Plan will be created subsequently, elaborating on specific tasks, timelines, and resource assignments.  This plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses.
