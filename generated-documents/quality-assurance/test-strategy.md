# Test Strategy: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Quality Assurance Manager


## 1. Testing Objectives and Goals

The primary objective of testing is to ensure the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent meets its functional and non-functional requirements, providing a reliable, secure, and efficient solution for generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis documents.  Specific goals include:

* **Functionality:** Verify the accurate generation of PMBOK and BABOK compliant documents based on various input data sets.  This includes validating the content, format, and structure of the generated outputs.
* **Performance:** Assess the speed and efficiency of document generation, ensuring it meets performance benchmarks (e.g., generation time under 2 seconds for the Fortune 500 dataset).
* **Security:** Validate the security mechanisms of the API, including authentication, authorization, and data protection.
* **Usability:** Evaluate the ease of use of the CLI interface and API documentation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
* **Scalability:** Test the API's ability to handle a large volume of requests and data.
* **Reliability:** Verify the stability and robustness of the system under various conditions.
* **Compatibility:** Confirm compatibility across different operating systems, browsers, and AI providers.

**Quality Criteria:**  The system must meet the following criteria:

* 100% BABOK v3 compliance in generated documents.
* 99.9% accuracy in data processing and document generation.
* Average document generation time under 2 seconds for the Fortune 500 dataset.
* Zero critical security vulnerabilities identified.
* User satisfaction score (measured via surveys) above 80%.
* System uptime above 99.9%.

**Success Metrics:**  Success will be measured by:

* Number of passed test cases.
* Number of defects found and resolved.
* Test coverage percentage.
* Performance test results (response time, throughput).
* Security vulnerability scan results.
* User feedback and satisfaction scores.


## 2. Test Scope and Approach

**In-Scope:**

* API functionality (document generation, template management, job management).
* CLI functionality.
* API security (authentication, authorization, input validation).
* Performance testing (load, stress, endurance).
* Usability testing (CLI interface, API documentation).
* Integration testing with different AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* Compatibility testing across different operating systems and browsers.


**Out-of-Scope:**

* Testing of third-party libraries and dependencies (unless critical bugs are discovered).
* Penetration testing (this will be handled separately by a security specialist team).
* User interface (UI) testing for any potential future UI components.


**Test Levels:**

* **Unit Testing:**  Individual components and modules will be tested.
* **Integration Testing:**  Interaction between different modules and components will be verified.
* **System Testing:**  End-to-end testing of the complete system.
* **Acceptance Testing:**  User acceptance testing (UAT) will be conducted by business stakeholders and end-users.


**Testing Types:**

* **Functional Testing:** Verify that all functionalities meet the specified requirements.
* **Non-functional Testing:**  Performance, security, usability, reliability, compatibility, and scalability testing.
* **Performance Testing:** Load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing to evaluate system performance under various loads.
* **Security Testing:**  Authentication, authorization, input validation, and vulnerability scanning.
* **Compatibility Testing:**  Testing across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge), and AI providers.
* **Usability Testing:**  Evaluation of the CLI interface and API documentation.


**Risk-Based Testing Priorities:**  High priority will be given to:

* API functionality (document generation)
* API security
* Performance under expected load


## 3. Test Environment Strategy

**Test Environment Requirements:**

* **Development Environment:**  For unit and integration testing.  This environment should mirror the production environment as closely as possible.
* **Testing Environment:**  For system and performance testing.  This environment should be a scaled-down version of production.
* **Staging Environment:**  For UAT and final validation before deployment to production.


**Test Data Management:**

* Test data will be generated to cover various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.  The Fortune 500 dataset will be used as a primary benchmark for performance and functional testing.
* Data privacy will be ensured by anonymizing or using synthetic data where necessary.  Data will be managed securely and deleted after testing.


**Environment Dependencies:**

* Access to various AI providers' APIs (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* Database connection (if applicable).
* Network connectivity.


**Environment Setup, Maintenance, and Refresh:**  Detailed procedures will be documented and followed to ensure consistent and reliable testing environments.


## 4. Test Organization and Roles
