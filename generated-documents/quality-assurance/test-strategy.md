# Test Strategy: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Quality Assurance Manager


## 1. Testing Objectives and Goals

The primary objective of testing ADPA is to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, secure, and scalable framework that meets all functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the project documentation.  This includes validating compliance with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 standards where applicable.

**Measurable Objectives:**

* Achieve 95% test coverage across all modules and functionalities.
* Identify and resolve all critical and high-priority defects before release.
* Achieve a defect density of less than 0.5 defects per 1000 lines of code.
* Demonstrate successful integration with all key third-party systems (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services).
* Verify performance under expected load conditions (defined in performance testing section).
* Ensure compliance with relevant security and regulatory standards (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS).

**Acceptance Thresholds:**

* Less than 5% open critical defects at the end of testing.
* Successful completion of all planned test cases with acceptable pass rates (defined for each test level).
* Positive feedback from user acceptance testing (UAT).

**Success Metrics & KPIs:**

* Test execution completion rate
* Defect detection rate
* Defect resolution rate
* Test case pass rate
* Test coverage percentage
* Time to resolution for critical defects


## 2. Test Scope and Approach

**In-Scope:**

* All core functionalities: Document generation, CLI, REST API, Admin Interface, Integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services).
* All supported frameworks: BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0 (where implemented).
* All AI provider integrations: OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama.
* Security features: Authentication, authorization, data encryption.
* Performance and scalability under expected load.
* User interface (UI) usability and accessibility.

**Out-of-Scope:**

* Third-party libraries and frameworks (unless critical integration issues arise).
* Testing of client-side applications built *on top of* ADPA (unless specifically requested).
* Comprehensive penetration testing (this will be addressed in a separate security audit).


**Test Levels:**

* **Unit Testing:**  Individual modules and components will be tested using unit tests written in TypeScript and Jest.
* **Integration Testing:** Interactions between modules and components will be verified.
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete system, including API and UI.
* **Acceptance Testing:** User acceptance testing (UAT) will be performed by business stakeholders.

**Testing Types:**

* **Functional Testing:** Verification of all functionalities against requirements.
* **Non-functional Testing:** Performance, security, usability, compatibility, and accessibility testing.
* **Performance Testing:** Load, stress, and endurance testing to determine system scalability and stability.
* **Security Testing:**  Vulnerability scanning, penetration testing (by a dedicated security team), authentication and authorization testing.
* **Compatibility Testing:** Testing across different browsers, operating systems, and AI providers.
* **Usability Testing:** Evaluation of the user experience through usability testing sessions.


**Risk-Based Testing Priorities:**

Critical path testing will focus on the core document generation engine, REST API, and authentication mechanisms.  Higher priority will be given to testing features with high business impact and those associated with higher identified risks.


## 3. Test Environment Strategy

**Test Environment Requirements:**

* **Development Environment:** For developers' use and initial testing.
* **Testing Environment:** A dedicated environment for system, integration, and performance testing, mirroring production as closely as possible.
* **Staging Environment:** A pre-production environment for UAT.

**Test Data Management:**

* Synthetic test data will be generated to cover various scenarios and edge cases.
* Data masking techniques will be employed to protect sensitive information.
* Data privacy considerations will be strictly adhered to, complying with relevant regulations.

**Environment Dependencies:**

* Access to all required AI provider APIs.
* Access to Confluence and SharePoint instances for integration testing.
* Network connectivity and infrastructure.

**Environment Setup, Maintenance, and Refresh:**

* Detailed procedures for setting up, configuring, and maintaining each test environment will be documented.
* Regular backups and environment refreshes will be scheduled.


## 4. Test Organization and Roles

**Testing Team Structure:**

* **Test Lead:** Responsible for overall test planning, execution, and reporting.
* **Test Engineers:** Responsible for designing, developing, and executing test cases.
* **Automation Engineers:** Responsible for developing and maintaining automated test scripts.
* **Performance Testers:** Responsible for conducting performance and load tests.
* **Security Testers:** (Separate team) Responsible for conducting security assessments.

**Required Skills and Competencies:**

* Strong understanding of software testing methodologies.
* Experience with automated testing tools (e.g., Jest).
* Proficiency in TypeScript and JavaScript.
* Understanding of API testing and RESTful services.
* Knowledge of performance testing tools (e.g., JMeter - to be determined).
* Experience with security testing (for security testers).

**Communication Protocols:**

* Daily stand-up meetings.
* Weekly progress reports.
* Defect tracking system (Jira - to be determined).
* Regular communication with stakeholders.

**Escalation Procedures:**

* Critical defects will be escalated to the project manager immediately.
* Blockers will be escalated to the development team.


## 5. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Key Testing Risks:**

* **Technical Risks:** Integration issues with third-party APIs, unexpected behavior of AI providers.
* **Resource Risks:** Insufficient testing resources, delays in resource allocation.
* **Schedule Risks:** Delays in development, insufficient time for thorough testing.
* **Quality Risks:** Inadequate test coverage, insufficient defect detection.

**Risk Assessment:**

A detailed risk assessment matrix will be created, considering the probability and impact of each risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Technical Risks:** Implement robust error handling, thorough integration testing, and contingency plans for API failures.
* **Resource Risks:** Proactive resource planning, clear roles and responsibilities, potential for outsourcing certain testing tasks.
* **Schedule Risks:** Agile development methodology, prioritization of testing efforts, and close monitoring of progress.
* **Quality Risks:** Comprehensive test planning, code reviews, and regular test coverage assessments.
