# Feature Roadmap: Automated Compliance Document Generation

## Overview
Automatically generate compliance documents (GDPR, SOX, Risk Assessment, Approval Workflow, etc.) based on the detection of sensitive content (PII, financials, etc.) in project design artifacts.

## Motivation
- Ensure compliance requirements are addressed proactively.
- Reduce manual effort and risk of missing mandatory compliance documentation.
- Centralize compliance management in the `generated-documents/compliance` folder.

## Proposed Workflow
1. **Detection**: Scan project design documents for PII, financial, and other compliance-relevant content.
2. **Template Generation**: Automatically create or update compliance templates when relevant content is detected.
3. **Linkage**: Reference generated compliance documents in main project documentation for traceability.
4. **Annual Review**: Include checklist and review metadata in each compliance document.

## Example Triggers
- PII detected → Generate/update GDPR Compliance Template
- Financial data detected → Generate/update SOX Compliance Template
- Risk-related content detected → Generate/update Risk Assessment Template

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate with document pipeline for real-time compliance checks.
- Support additional compliance frameworks as needed.
- Automate notifications for annual review deadlines.
