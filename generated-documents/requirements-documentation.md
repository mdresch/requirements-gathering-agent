# Requirements Documentation: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared by:**  [Your Name/Company]


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent. ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This document details functional and non-functional requirements,  design considerations, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Overall Description

ADPA automates the creation of project documentation, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.  It leverages AI to analyze project context from various sources (primarily README.md and related project files) and generate a suite of documents.  The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and adaptable to different AI providers and project contexts.  A command-line interface (CLI) provides user interaction and control.

### 2.1 Product Perspective

ADPA is a command-line tool that operates independently but interacts with various AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama). Output is generated in markdown format, organized into a structured directory.  It integrates with existing project files, enhancing existing documentation efforts.

### 2.2 Product Functions

ADPA performs the following functions:

* **Project Context Analysis:**  Intelligently analyzes project documentation (README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.) to extract relevant information.  This includes scoring the relevance of different sources.
* **Document Generation:** Generates a comprehensive set of PMBOK-compliant documents, including (but not limited to):
    * Project Charter
    * Stakeholder Register
    * Scope Management Plan
    * Risk Management Plan
    * Communication Management Plan
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
    * Technical Design Documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, Error Handling)
    * Strategic Documents (Purpose Statement, Company Values)
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing quality scores and recommendations.
* **Context Management:**  Utilizes a three-phase context management strategy to optimize the use of AI model context windows.
* **Version Control:**  Maintains a local Git repository to track changes in generated documents.
* **Multi-Provider Support:** Supports multiple AI providers, allowing users to select their preferred option.
* **CLI Interaction:** Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction and control.

### 2.3 User Characteristics

ADPA targets project managers, business analysts, and technical leads who require efficient and accurate project documentation.  Users should possess basic command-line skills.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

ADPA is a Node.js application. It requires Node.js version 18.0.0 or higher and an API key for the chosen AI provider.  The system should be compatible with various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

* **AI Provider API Limits:**  The system must account for token limits and rate limits imposed by the various AI providers.
* **Data Security:**  Secure handling of API keys and project data is crucial.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be designed for easy maintenance and extensibility.
* **Performance:**  The system should generate documents efficiently, minimizing processing time.
