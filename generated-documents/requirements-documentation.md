# Requirements Documentation: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared by:**  [Your Name/Company]


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This document details functional and non-functional requirements,  design considerations, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective:** ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Node.js and TypeScript. It integrates with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to generate various project management documents.  It's designed for project managers, business analysts, and developers needing efficient and accurate documentation.

**2.2 Product Functions:** ADPA's core functions include:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Intelligent discovery and analysis of project documentation (README.md and beyond) to build rich context for document generation.
* **Context-Aware Document Generation:** AI-powered generation of PMBOK-compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, etc.) and technical design documents.
* **Multiple AI Provider Support:** Flexibility to choose among several AI providers based on cost, performance, and availability.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Built-in validation to ensure generated documents adhere to PMBOK standards.
* **Document Quality Assessment:** Provides quality scores and recommendations for improvement.
* **Version Control System (VCS) Integration:** Tracks changes to generated documents using Git.
* **Modular Architecture:** Extensible design allowing for future expansion of document types and AI provider integration.
* **Strategic Document Generation:**  Creation of high-level strategic documents like Company Values and Purpose Statements.
* **Technical Design Document Generation:**  Generation of detailed technical documentation (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, etc.)


**2.3 User Characteristics:**  Users will be project managers, business analysts, and technical leads with varying levels of familiarity with project management methodologies and command-line tools. The CLI should be intuitive and user-friendly, providing clear instructions and error handling.


**2.4 Operating Environment:** ADPA will run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) with Node.js 18.0.0 or higher installed.  It requires an active internet connection to access AI services.


**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:**  The system must be designed to handle large projects with extensive documentation.  Scalability and performance are critical considerations.  Security and compliance with data privacy regulations are paramount.  The system should leverage existing open-source libraries and frameworks where possible.


**2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies:**  The success of ADPA relies on the availability and performance of chosen AI providers.  The accuracy of generated documents depends on the quality and completeness of the input project documentation.

**2.7 User Documentation:**  Comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and FAQs, will be provided.
