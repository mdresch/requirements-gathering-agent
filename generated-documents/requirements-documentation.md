# Requirements Documentation: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Requirements Documentation Generator


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This document details functional and non-functional requirements,  considerations for user experience, and outlines the testing strategy.


## 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective:** ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Node.js and TypeScript. It integrates with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to generate various project management documents.  It aims to replace manual documentation processes, improving efficiency and consistency.

**2.2 Product Functions:** ADPA performs the following key functions:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Analyzes project documentation (README.md and beyond) to build a rich context for document generation.
* **Context-Aware Document Generation:** Generates PMBOK-compliant documents tailored to the project's specific context.
* **Multiple AI Provider Support:** Offers flexibility in choosing the AI model and provider.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards.
* **Document Quality Assessment:** Provides quality scores and improvement recommendations.
* **Technical Design Documentation Generation:** Generates a suite of technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, etc.).
* **Business Communication Translation:** Translates technical project context into executive-ready strategic business documents (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.).
* **Version Control System Integration:**  Provides built-in version control for generated documents.

**2.3 User Characteristics:**  Target users include project managers, business analysts, and technical leads who need to create and maintain project documentation.  Technical proficiency with command-line tools is assumed.

**2.4 Operating Environment:** ADPA runs on Node.js 18.0.0 or higher and requires an active API key for at least one supported AI provider.  It operates on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:**

* **API Limitations:**  The tool's capabilities are constrained by the limitations of the underlying AI providers' APIs (token limits, response times, etc.).
* **Data Dependency:** The quality of generated documents is highly dependent on the completeness and accuracy of the input project documentation.
* **Security:**  Secure handling of API keys and user data is paramount.
