# Data Security & Privacy Plan  
**Project:** adpa-enterprise-framework-automation  
**Version:** 3.2.0  

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes the data security and privacy policies, controls, and responsibilities for the “adpa-enterprise-framework-automation” platform—a Node.js/TypeScript, modular, enterprise automation framework for requirements, project, and data management. The plan aims to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of data and ensure compliance with relevant privacy regulations.

### 1.2 Scope
This plan applies to all environments (development, test, production) and covers all data processed, stored, or transmitted by the framework, including:
- Customer, employee, and end-user data
- Project and requirements documentation
- Financial, operational, and audit data
- Intellectual property, templates, and proprietary logic
- Logs and telemetry

## 2. Security Policies

### 2.1 Data Classification Policy
- **Policy:** Data is classified as *Public*, *Internal*, *Confidential*, or *Restricted*.
- **Controls:**  
  - Data classification is defined at the schema/model level.
  - Access is restricted via role-based access control (RBAC) and enforced in middleware and API layers.
  - Sensitive data (PII, financial) is marked and logged access is monitored.

### 2.2 Access Control Policy
- **Policy:** Enforce least privilege and RBAC across API, CLI, and integrated services.
- **Controls:**  
  - **Authentication:**  
    - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and/or OAuth2 for user/API authentication.
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for privileged/admin access.
    - API keys are required for service/service and CLI access, rotated on a schedule.
  - **Authorization:**  
    - RBAC with granular permissions; enforced via middleware and database queries.
    - Support for enterprise SSO integration (Azure AD, Google Identity, etc.).
  - **Access Reviews:**  
    - Quarterly reviews of user, service, and admin access.

### 2.3 Encryption Policy
- **Policy:** Encryption is mandatory for all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- **Controls:**  
  - **At Rest:**  
    - Use AES-256 for all persisted data (databases, object/file storage, secrets).
    - Credential and secret management via environment variables or secure vaults (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
  - **In Transit:**  
    - All API endpoints require HTTPS/TLS 1.3.
    - Internal service communication (microservices, provider APIs) also secured by TLS.
  - **Secrets Management:**  
    - No credentials or secrets are stored in source code or version control.
    - .env files are excluded from repositories and managed per environment.

### 2.4 Logging & Monitoring Policy
- **Policy:** Security events and access are logged and monitored for anomalies.
- **Controls:**  
  - Centralized logging (e.g., via Winston, Azure Monitor) with log rotation and retention.
  - Masking of sensitive data in logs.
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity (failed logins, privilege escalation).

### 2.5 Incident Response Policy
- **Policy:** Maintain and regularly test a formal incident response plan.
- **Controls:**  
  - Defined incident response team and escalation contacts.
  - Playbooks for common incidents (data breach, malware, DDoS).
  - Forensic logging to facilitate investigation.
  - Root cause analysis and post-incident reporting.
  - Regulatory notification in accordance with GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable laws.

## 3. Privacy Policies

### 3.1 Data Minimization
- **Policy:** Only data necessary for business and technical requirements is collected and retained.
- **Controls:**  
  - Data fields and retention are reviewed during design and periodically thereafter.
  - Temporary files and cache are purged automatically after use.

### 3.2 Purpose Limitation
- **Policy:** Personal data is used only for specified, legitimate purposes.
- **Controls:**  
  - Data usage is documented and limited by API/service design.
  - Use of data for analytics/training is opt-in and anonymized where possible.

### 3.3 Data Subject Rights
- **Policy:** Framework supports data subject rights (access, rectification, erasure, portability).
- **Controls:**  
  - Mechanisms to process data subject requests within regulatory timeframes (e.g., GDPR 30 days).
  - Audit trails for data changes and subject requests.

### 3.4 Data Retention & Deletion
- **Policy:** Retain data only as long as necessary; securely delete data after retention period or upon request.
- **Controls:**  
  - Data lifecycle management for all storage layers.
  - Secure wiping and cryptographic erase for deletions.
  - Automated job for expired data cleanup.
