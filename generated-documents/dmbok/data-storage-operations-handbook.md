# Data Storage & Operations Handbook  
**For ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework**  
_Aligned with DAMA DMBOK 2.0 Guidelines_  

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This handbook establishes standards, procedures, and best practices for data storage, database administration, and operational management in the ADPA enterprise automation framework. It ensures secure, efficient, and reliable data handling, aligning with DMBOK 2.0 and enterprise requirements for compliance, scalability, and maintainability.

### 1.2 Scope
This document applies to all systems and teams managing data for ADPA, including:
- Database administrators (DBAs)
- DevOps and operations engineers
- Developers interfacing with storage or data migration
- Compliance and security teams

Covered topics include:
- Database design, implementation, and lifecycle management
- Storage infrastructure (on-premises, cloud, hybrid)
- Operational procedures (monitoring, backup, recovery, maintenance)
- Security, compliance, and access control
- Documentation and continuous improvement

## 2. Database Architecture

### 2.1 Database Management Systems

**ADPA Default Configuration:**
- **Primary Data Store:**  
  - **Type:** JSON-based configuration files (default for metadata, templates, and settings)
  - **Location:** `/src/documentTemplates/`, `/src/modules/`, `/docs/`
- **Extensibility:**  
  - Supports integration with relational (SQL) or NoSQL databases for enterprise deployments
  - **Recommended DBMS for Enterprise:**  
    - **Relational:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server  
    - **NoSQL:** MongoDB (for unstructured data, logs, analytics)
- **Data Warehouse (Optional):**  
  - For analytics and reporting, integration with cloud warehouses (Azure Synapse, Snowflake, BigQuery)

**Best Practice:**  
_Use a modular approachâ€”begin with the default file-based setup for development, and transition to enterprise DBMS for production._

### 2.2 Database Design Standards

- **Naming Conventions:**  
  - Use clear, descriptive names for tables/collections, columns/fields, and indexes (e.g., `user_accounts`, `document_templates`)
  - Follow snake_case or camelCase consistently

- **Schema Design Principles:**  
  - Normalize to 3NF where appropriate (relational)
  - For NoSQL, design collections around access patterns and denormalize as needed for performance

- **Indexing Strategy:**  
  - Index primary keys and frequently queried fields
  - Monitor index usage and adjust based on query patterns

- **Partitioning Approach:**  
  - For large datasets, use table partitioning (date, tenant, or logical domain)
  - In NoSQL, use sharding as appropriate

- **Data Modeling:**  
  - Maintain ERD (Entity Relationship Diagrams) for relational schemas
  - Document data models and mappings for NoSQL

## 3. Storage Management

### 3.1 Storage Infrastructure

- **Local Development:**  
  - Use project directory structure (`/docs/`, `/generated-documents/`)
- **Enterprise/Production:**  
  - **SAN/NAS:** For on-premises, use Storage Area Networks (SAN) or Network-Attached Storage (NAS) for high availability and redundancy
  - **Cloud Storage:**  
    - Use Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage for scalable document archives and backups
    - Separate storage accounts/buckets for production, dev, test
  - **Storage Tiering:**  
    - Define tiers (hot, warm, cold) for performance/cost optimization. E.g., recent documents on SSD, archives on object storage.

### 3.2 Capacity Planning

- **Growth Projections:**  
  - Estimate data growth (GB/month) based on document volumes, logs, and user base
  - Regularly review storage utilization dashboards

- **Performance Requirements:**  
  - Set IOPS/throughput targets per workload (e.g., API response < 200ms for metadata queries)
  - Use SSD for high-transaction workloads

- **Scalability:**  
  - Plan for horizontal scaling (sharding, partitioning)
  - Use cloud auto-scaling where available

- **Cost Optimization:**  
  - Archive infrequently accessed data to cold storage
  - Purge obsolete data per retention policy

## 4. Database Administration

### 4.1 Installation and Configuration

- **Standard Procedures:**
  - Follow vendor best practices for DBMS installation (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
  - Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for repeatable deployments (Terraform, ARM templates, CloudFormation)

- **Configuration Parameters:**  
  - Set memory, connection pool, and cache settings according to workload
  - Enable slow query logging

- **Security Settings:**  
  - Disable default/public accounts
  - Enforce encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
  - Regularly update DBMS to latest stable version

- **High Availability (HA) Setup:**  
  - Use clustering (e.g., PostgreSQL replication, MongoDB replica sets)
  - Set up automated failover and health checks

### 4.2 Performance Monitoring

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**  
  - Query latency
  - Transaction throughput
  - Cache hit ratio
  - Replication lag
  - Disk usage

- **Monitoring Tools:**  
  - Open-source: Prometheus, Grafana, pgAdmin, MongoDB Compass
  - Cloud-native: Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, Google Stackdriver

- **Alert Thresholds:**  
  - Set alerts for CPU > 80%, disk > 80%, replication lag, failed backups, etc.

- **Performance Tuning:**  
  - Regularly analyze slow queries and add/adjust indexes
  - Vacuum/analyze tables (relational)
  - Rebalance shards/replica sets as needed

## 5. Data Operations

### 5.1 Backup and Recovery

- **Backup Schedules:**  
  - Daily full backups, hourly incremental/differential (for mission-critical data)
  - Store backups on separate physical/cloud infrastructure

- **Retention Policies:**  
  - Retain daily/weekly/monthly snapshots per compliance needs (e.g., 7 days, 4 weeks, 12 months)

- **RPO/RTO:**  
  - Define Recovery Point Objective (e.g., max 1h data loss)
  - Define Recovery Time Objective (e.g., restore in <2h)

- **Disaster Recovery Procedures:**  
  - Document step-by-step restoration; regularly test restores (quarterly DR drills)
  - Store backup/restore scripts in version control

### 5.2 Data Migration

- **Strategy:**  
  - Use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines for bulk migrations
  - Validate data types, relationships, and integrity during migration

- **ETL Tools:**  
  - Node.js scripts, Azure Data Factory, AWS Glue, custom TypeScript utilities

- **Validation:**  
  - Run checksums, record counts, and spot data validation post-migration

- **Rollback:**  
  - Always snapshot source data before migration
  - Prepare rollback scripts/procedures for major migrations

  - Enforce TLS for data in transit

- **Data Masking & Tokenization:**  
  - Mask sensitive fields (PII, financial data) in non-prod/test environments
  - Use tokenization for API responses where applicable

- **Key Management:**  
  - Use managed key vaults (Azure Key Vault, AWS KMS, GCP KMS)

# Appendix: ADPA-Specific Considerations

- **JSON-Based Configuration:**  
  - For development and small-scale use, maintain configuration and template data in version-controlled JSON files.  
  - For enterprise, migrate to SQL/NoSQL for scalability, auditability, and performance.

- **API Audit Trails:**  
  - All API actions (generation, upload, publish) should be logged for compliance and traceability.

- **Integration with External Systems:**  
  - Use secure connectors and managed identities for Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, and cloud storage integration.

- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Leverage automated test suites (`npm test`, integration scripts) to validate data integrity and operational readiness of the storage layer.
