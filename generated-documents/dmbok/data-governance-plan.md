# Data Governance Plan

**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Prepared by:** Data Governance Lead  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope

This Data Governance Plan establishes a comprehensive framework for managing data assets within the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project. ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis, supporting enterprise integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, etc.) and complying with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.

This plan is designed to:
- Ensure high data quality and integrity across all ADPA modules and integrations.
- Support regulatory and industry compliance (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, FINRA, Basel III, etc.).
- Align with DMBOK 2.0 principles and enterprise objectives for secure, scalable, and effective data management.

### 1.2 Alignment with DMBOK and Organizational Objectives

ADPA’s data governance aligns with DMBOK 2.0 by:
- Defining clear data stewardship and ownership.
- Establishing robust data quality, privacy, and security controls.
- Enabling enterprise-wide data integration, standardization, and compliance.
- Supporting continuous improvement and auditability.

## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1 Roles & Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Chief Data Officer (CDO)**      | Executive accountability, regulatory compliance, risk management.                                    |
| **Data Stewards**             | Daily data quality, metadata management, access authorization, stewardship of specific domains (e.g., documents, templates, user data, audit logs). |
| **System/Data Owners**           | Accountability for business data assets, stewardship assignment, data lifecycle decisions.             |
| **Data Custodians (IT)**         | Technical controls, data storage, backup, disaster recovery, infrastructure security.                 |
| **Solution Architects**          | Ensure data models and APIs comply with governance standards.                                         |
| **Integration Leads**            | Ensure external system integrations (SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe, AI providers) comply with governance and security requirements. |
| **End Users**                   | Adhere to data usage, privacy, and security policies.                                                 |

### 2.2 Committees and Escalation Paths

- **Data Governance Council:**  
  Meets quarterly, reviews policies, resolves escalated issues.
- **Data Quality Committee:**  
  Monitors and remediates cross-functional data quality issues.
- **Escalation:**  
  Non-compliance or unresolved data issues are escalated from Data Stewards → Data Governance Council → CDO.

## 3. Data Policies, Standards, and Procedures

### 3.1 Key Data Policies

- **Data Classification:**  
  All data (including generated documents, templates, configurations, user data, and audit logs) is classified as:
  - *Confidential*: User credentials, auth tokens, audit logs.
  - *Internal*: Generated business documents, templates, analytics.
  - *Public*: Open-source code, documentation.

- **Data Retention:**  
  - Generated and stored documents: 7 years (unless superseded by client policy).
  - Authentication logs: 1 year.
  - Audit logs: 3 years.
  - Configuration files: Indefinite, with version control.

- **Access Control:**  
  - Role-based access (RBAC) enforced for all interfaces (API, CLI, Web).
  - OAuth2, SAML, Active Directory integration for enterprise deployments.
  - Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

- **Data Privacy & Protection:**  
  - All personal data handled per GDPR, CCPA, and relevant regulations.
  - Data encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256).
  - Anonymization and pseudonymization for analytics and reporting data.

- **Data Security:**  
  - Secure API endpoints (JWT, API keys).
  - Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
  - Use of secure development practices (OWASP top 10).

- **Data Quality:**  
  - Templates and generated documents must conform to business and regulatory standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
  - Validation, completeness, and consistency checks for all input/output.

### 3.2 Standards

- **Metadata Standards:**  
  - All documents, templates, and data objects tagged with version, author, timestamp, and classification.
- **Naming Conventions:**  
  - Standardized naming for templates, documents, and APIs (snake_case for files, camelCase for variables).
- **Documentation Standards:**  
  - All data assets documented in the project’s documentation repository and/or enterprise knowledge base (e.g., Confluence).

### 3.3 Procedures

- **Data Lifecycle Management:**  
  - Clear onboarding, change management, archival, and deletion processes for all data types.
- **Incident Response:**  
  - Data breaches are reported to the CDO and Data Governance Council within 24 hours.
  - Root cause analysis and remediation procedures in place.
- **Change Control:**  
  - All changes to data-related code or configurations reviewed and approved through GitHub pull requests and change control board.
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  - Automated, encrypted backups of configuration, templates, and persistent data.
  - Disaster recovery drills tested bi-annually.
