# Metadata Management Framework for **adpa-enterprise-framework-automation**  
_Aligned with DMBOK 2.0 Best Practices_  

---

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose and Scope
This framework defines standards, processes, roles, and technology for managing metadata throughout the lifecycle of the **adpa-enterprise-framework-automation** platform—a modular, enterprise-ready Node.js/TypeScript automation system supporting requirements, project, and data management. The framework ensures metadata is accurate, discoverable, secure, and aligned with enterprise objectives, supporting both business and technical stakeholders.

### Alignment with Data Strategy
Metadata management is foundational to the project’s data strategy, enabling:
- Regulatory and standards compliance (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th, DMBOK 2.0)
- Data discoverability, lineage, and quality
- Secure, scalable, and maintainable automation
- Integration with external platforms (e.g., Azure, Adobe, SharePoint)

### Key Drivers and Business Benefits
- **Improved Data Quality and Trust**
- **Regulatory Compliance and Auditability**
- **Accelerated Development and Automation**
- **Enhanced Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**

## 2. Metadata Principles and Policies

### Core Principles
- **Accuracy:** Metadata must reflect the true state of assets.
- **Accessibility:** Metadata is available to authorized users and systems.
- **Consistency:** Standardized definitions and formats across the ecosystem.
- **Security & Privacy:** Metadata is managed according to enterprise security policies.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Metadata is managed from creation to retirement.

### Policies
- **Creation:** All new data assets (templates, APIs, scripts, documents) must have associated metadata registered in the central repository.
- **Storage:** Metadata is stored in a centralized, version-controlled repository.
- **Access:** Role-based access control (RBAC) for metadata viewing and editing.
- **Stewardship:** Business and technical owners are assigned stewardship over their respective metadata domains.

---

## 3. Metadata Architecture

### Metadata Repository
- **Centralized metadata repository** (e.g., integrated with data catalog or database)
- **Supports business, technical, and operational metadata**

### Integration
- **Automated harvesting** from code (TypeScript interfaces, OpenAPI/TypeSpec specs), configuration, and external APIs (Adobe, Azure, SharePoint).
- **APIs and CLI** for programmatic access and registration.
- **Synchronization** with external catalogs (Azure API Center, SharePoint Document Library).

### Discovery & Harvesting
- **Automated scanning** of source code, scripts, and configuration.
- **Manual registration** for business metadata via UI/CLI.
- **Integration with continuous integration/continuous delivery** (CI/CD) pipelines for capturing operational metadata.

---

## 4. Metadata Standards

### Business Metadata
- **Data Dictionary:** Definitions, synonyms, business rules for terms used in requirements, templates, and documents.
- **Business Glossary:** Centralized repository of business terms and acronyms.
- **Ownership and Stewardship:** Mapped to business units/roles.

### Technical Metadata
- **Schema Definitions:** TypeSpec/OpenAPI schemas, TypeScript interfaces.
- **Data Lineage:** Tracking data flow from source (Markdown, APIs) through transformation (Puppeteer, Adobe APIs) to output (PDF, InDesign, SharePoint).
- **Mappings:** ETL and API mapping specifications (field-level).

### Operational Metadata
- **Job Execution Logs:** API/server execution, document generation runs, error logs.
- **Data Quality Metrics:** Validation results, completeness, accuracy, timeliness.
- **Versioning Information:** Script, template, and API version history.

---

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Data Stewards:**  
  Oversee metadata quality, coordinate with business and technical teams, approve changes.

- **Data Owners:**  
  Accountable for accuracy and completeness of metadata for their assets (e.g., API, template, document).

- **Metadata Analysts:**  
  Curate, enrich, and validate metadata. Perform gap analysis and quality checks.

- **IT and Data Management Teams:**  
  Maintain metadata infrastructure, support integration/harvesting, enforce policies.

- **Developers/DevOps:**  
  Ensure technical metadata is captured (schemas, mappings, operational logs).

---

## 6. Processes and Workflows

### Metadata Capture and Registration
- **Automated extraction** from codebase, OpenAPI/TypeSpec specs, CLI/API usage logs.
- **Manual entry** for business/semantic metadata via UI or CLI.

### Metadata Curation and Enrichment
- **Review and validate** business glossary, data dictionary.
- **Enrich technical metadata** with business context and usage notes.

### Change Management
- **Version control** for all metadata artifacts (e.g., Git, repository).
- **Approval workflow** for updates to business-critical metadata.
- **Impact analysis** for changes to schemas, APIs, or templates.

### Metadata Quality Assurance
- **Periodic audits** for completeness, accuracy, and consistency.
- **Automated validation** (e.g., schema conformance, uniqueness, referential integrity).

---

## 7. Tooling and Technology

### Metadata Management Tools
- **Integrated data catalog** (e.g., Azure Purview, Collibra, or custom repository)
- **API and CLI interfaces** for metadata management
- **Version control** (e.g., Git) for tracking changes to metadata artifacts

### Integration
- **APIs for external systems:** SharePoint, Adobe, Azure API Center, etc.
- **Plugins/scripts** for automated harvesting from TypeScript, OpenAPI, and CI/CD.

### Repository Management
- **Tagging and classification** based on asset type, domain, or business process
- **Access controls** via RBAC

---

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Establish metadata repository and standards
- Define roles and onboarding/training for data stewards/owners
- Begin automated harvesting from codebase and APIs

### Phase 2: Integration and Automation
- Integrate with external metadata sources (Azure, SharePoint, Adobe)
- Implement CI/CD hooks for operational metadata
- Develop dashboards for metadata quality and coverage

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Refine processes and automate quality assurance
- Enable advanced lineage and impact analysis
- Expand business glossary and data dictionary
- Continuous training and communication

**Key Milestones:**
- Metadata repository live
- Automated harvesting operational
- Quality KPIs tracked and reported
- Full integration with business/technical workflows

---

## 9. Governance and Monitoring

### Metrics and KPIs
- **Metadata coverage:** % of assets with complete metadata
- **Data quality scores:** Completeness, accuracy, consistency
- **Usage metrics:** Frequency of metadata access/queries
- **Change approval turnaround time**

### Auditing and Compliance
- **Regular audits** for policy compliance
- **Automated checks** for role-based access and sensitive metadata exposure

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback loops** from users and stewards
- **Periodic review** of standards, processes, and tooling
- **Update roadmap** based on technology and business evolution
