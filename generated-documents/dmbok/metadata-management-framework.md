# Metadata Management Framework for ADPA

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope  
This Metadata Management Framework establishes the policies, principles, processes, roles, and supporting technologies to effectively manage metadata within the ADPA enterprise automation environment. It aligns with the DAMA DMBOK 2.0 standard and supports metadata needs for BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK integrated document generation and data management processes.

### 1.2 Alignment with Data Strategy  
Metadata management is a foundational capability enabling data governance, data quality, master data management, and enterprise analytics. This framework supports ADPA’s goal to deliver standardized, reusable, and trustworthy metadata artifacts for AI-powered document generation, project management, and data governance.

### 1.3 Key Drivers and Business Benefits  
- Ensures consistent understanding and usage of metadata across business and technical domains  
- Enables automation and intelligent context injection by AI engines using accurate metadata  
- Supports compliance with regulatory and enterprise standards (GDPR, SOX, Basel III, etc.)  
- Improves data discovery, lineage tracking, and impact analysis  
- Enhances data quality, reuse, and integration through shared metadata  
- Facilitates auditability, transparency, and continuous improvement

## 2. Metadata Principles and Policies

### 2.1 Core Principles  
- **Metadata as a First-Class Asset:** Treat metadata with the same rigor as data, ensuring quality, security, and stewardship  
- **Business and Technical Metadata Integration:** Metadata must capture business context (glossaries, definitions) and technical details (schemas, lineage)  
- **Standardization:** Apply consistent metadata standards and taxonomies across all ADPA components and integrations  
- **Accessibility:** Metadata should be discoverable and accessible to authorized users and systems via APIs and tooling  
- **Governance:** Metadata must be governed through defined roles, policies, and ongoing stewardship  
- **Automation:** Leverage AI and tooling to automate metadata capture, enrichment, and validation where possible  
- **Lifecycle Management:** Metadata must be managed through its entire lifecycle, including versioning, updates, and retirement  

### 2.2 Policies  
- Define metadata creation and registration criteria for each data domain and artifact type  
- Specify metadata security classifications and access controls aligned with enterprise IAM (e.g., Entra ID integration)  
- Enforce metadata quality standards including completeness, accuracy, and timeliness  
- Mandate metadata change management and audit logging for traceability  
- Require metadata compliance with applicable regulations (GDPR, PCI DSS, etc.)  

### 2.3 Data Stewardship and Ownership  
- Assign clear stewardship for metadata domains to Data Stewards and Data Owners  
- Stewards are responsible for metadata accuracy, policy enforcement, and user support  
- Owners approve metadata standards and changes, ensuring alignment with business goals

## 3. Metadata Architecture

### 3.1 Metadata Repository Overview  
- Implement a centralized, scalable metadata repository supporting structured and unstructured metadata  
- Support JSON-based configuration for extensibility, with potential integration to SQL/NoSQL stores  
- Provide APIs (RESTful) for metadata CRUD operations, discovery, and lineage queries  

### 3.2 Integration with Data Sources and Tools  
- Automate metadata harvesting from source systems (databases, file stores, document systems like SharePoint and Confluence)  
- Integrate metadata capture within ADPA’s document generation modules and AI processing engines  
- Support metadata federation to aggregate from multiple repositories if needed  

### 3.3 Metadata Discovery and Harvesting  
- Schedule periodic automated scans and metadata extraction jobs  
- Enable manual metadata registration through admin web interface and CLI tools  
- Leverage AI-powered enrichment for metadata tagging and classification  

---

## 4. Metadata Standards

### 4.1 Business Metadata Standards  
- **Business Glossary:** Enterprise-approved business terms with definitions, synonyms, and usage notes  
- **Data Dictionary:** Detailed data element descriptions aligned with business glossary terms  
- **Business Rules:** Documented rules that govern data usage and quality  

### 4.2 Technical Metadata Standards  
- **Data Models and Schemas:** Logical and physical models, including ER diagrams, JSON schemas, OpenAPI specs  
- **Data Lineage:** End-to-end lineage documenting data flow, transformations, and dependencies  
- **Data Mappings:** Source to target mappings for ETL and data integration processes  

### 4.3 Operational Metadata Standards  
- **Job Execution Logs:** Metadata capturing data pipeline runs, success/failure, durations  
- **Data Quality Metrics:** Scores and metrics linked to data assets, including completeness and accuracy  
- **Access Logs and Usage Statistics:** Metadata on data and documentation access events
