# Data Architecture & Modeling Guide  
**For:** adpa-enterprise-framework-automation  
**Aligned to DMBOK 2.0, BABOK v3, and PMBOK 7th Edition Principles**

---

## 1. Introduction

**Purpose:**  
This guide defines the data architecture and modeling standards for the *adpa-enterprise-framework-automation* project—a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript automation framework for enterprise requirements, project, and data management.

**Scope:**  
Covers data modeling, architecture principles, governance, and implementation for all framework modules and integrations (including Adobe Creative Suite, SharePoint, Azure, API Center, and AI services).

**Strategic Alignment:**  
Supports organizational data strategies: data quality, security, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Ensures alignment with DMBOK 2.0 best practices.

---

## 2. Architectural Principles

**Core Data Architecture Principles:**  
- **Data as an Asset**: Treat data as a core enterprise asset with appropriate stewardship.
- **Security by Design**: Embed security and privacy controls at all data layers.
- **Standards Compliance**: Align with DMBOK, PMBOK, and BABOK requirements.
- **Modularity & Reuse**: Promote modular, reusable data models and APIs.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Design for high throughput, low latency, and horizontal scaling.
- **Lineage & Traceability**: Ensure metadata and audit trails for all data flows.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Backend:** Node.js (TypeScript), Express.js, TypeSpec
- **Data Integration:** REST APIs, OpenAPI, Azure API Center, Microsoft Graph API, Adobe Creative Suite APIs
- **Storage:** Relational (e.g., Azure SQL/PGSQL), Document DB (e.g., MongoDB), Object Stores (Azure Blob, SharePoint)
- **Authentication:** OAuth2, Azure AD, JWT
- **Tooling:** Swagger/OpenAPI, Redocly, Jest, TypeSpec, ERD tools

## 3. Current vs Target Architecture

### 3.1 Current State
- Markdown-driven pipeline → Puppeteer → PDF output.
- Core document management, template handling, and standards compliance APIs operational.
- Single-user, CLI/REST API, basic authentication and metadata.

### 3.2 Target State
- Content Analysis → Template Selection → Adobe Creative APIs (InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop) → Premium Outputs.
- Multi-user, role-based access, real-time collaboration (WebSockets), approval workflows.
- Azure API Center managed APIs, advanced metadata, and automated compliance checks.
- Integration with SharePoint for document publishing and versioning.

### 3.3 Gap Analysis
- **Multi-user support** and real-time collaboration to be implemented.
- Full Adobe Creative API integration pending.
- Enhanced data lineage, master/reference data management, and unified governance needed.

## 4. Data Modeling Standards

**Naming Conventions:**
- **Entities/Tables:** PascalCase (e.g., `DocumentJob`, `RequirementsTemplate`)
- **Attributes/Columns:** camelCase (e.g., `createdAt`, `templateId`)
- **Primary Keys:** `id` or `<entity>NameId`
- **Foreign Keys:** `<referencedEntity>Id`
- **Junction Tables:** `<EntityA>_<EntityB>`

**Normalization/Denormalization:**
- **OLTP:** Third Normal Form (3NF) for transactional entities.
- **OLAP/Reporting:** Denormalized for performance, with clear documentation of derivations.
- **Document Stores:** Embedded documents for tightly coupled data; references for loose coupling.

**Modeling Notation:**
- **ERD:** Crow’s Foot notation for relational schema.
- **UML/Class Diagrams:** For object/TypeScript models.
- **JSON Schema:** For API payload definitions.

## 5. Logical Data Model

**Core Domain Entities:**

| Entity             | Key Attributes                           | Relationships                                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| User               | id, email, name, role, status, createdAt | Member of Team; Owner of DocumentJob, Requirements      |
| Team               | id, name, description, createdAt         | Has Members (User); Manages Projects                    |
| Project            | id, name, description, teamId, status    | Contains DocumentJobs, Requirements, Templates          |
| DocumentJob        | id, projectId, userId, templateId, ...   | Uses Template; Generates Output; Linked to Files        |
| RequirementsTemplate| id, name, version, category, ...        | Used by DocumentJobs; Tagged with Standards             |
| Standard           | id, name, version, type                  | Linked to Templates, Compliance Checks                  |
| File/Asset         | id, jobId, type, location, metadata      | Output of DocumentJob; Published to SharePoint/Adobe    |
| AuditLog           | id, userId, action, entityType, ...      | Tracks changes across all main entities                 |

**Constraints:**
- All IDs are UUIDs.
- Email is unique for User.
- Foreign keys must have ON DELETE CASCADE where appropriate.
- DocumentJobs cannot be orphaned (must belong to a Project).

---

## 6. Physical Data Model

**Schema per Environment:**
- **Development:** Use suffix `_dev` for schemas/tables.
- **Test:** Use `_test`.
- **Production:** No suffix.

**Indexing & Partitioning:**
- **Indexes:** On primary keys, foreign keys, and search/filter columns (e.g., `createdAt`, `status`).
- **Partitioning:** By `teamId` or `projectId` for scalability (if supported by DB).
- **API Payloads:** Validate and serialize using TypeSpec, Zod, or Joi.

**Performance Considerations:**
- Use pagination for all list endpoints.
- Prefer asynchronous, batched writes for document generation jobs.
- Use document storage (e.g., Azure Blob) for large output files; only store metadata/URIs in DB.

---

## 7. Master & Reference Data Considerations

- **Standards Catalog:** Reference datasets for BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK, etc. (versioned, read-only).
- **Templates Library:** Master data, versioned, with approval and publishing workflows.
- **Roles & Permissions:** Enumerated, centrally managed, extensible for new roles.
- **Status Enums:** Centralized management for all workflow statuses.
- **Tag Management:** Controlled vocabulary for template/project tagging.

---

## 8. Governance & Stewardship

**Roles & Responsibilities:**
- **Data Steward:** Ensures data quality, reference/master data management.
- **Data Owner:** Accountable for business meaning and compliance of data entities.
- **Data Architect:** Maintains models, oversees changes, ensures alignment with DMBOK.

**Change-Control Process:**
- All changes to data models require:
  - Impact analysis
  - Peer review (data architect, stewards)
  - Versioning and migration scripts
  - Documentation update (ERDs, JSON Schemas)
- Use PRs and change logs in Git for traceability.

---

## 9. Tooling & Repository Management

- **Modeling Tools:**  
  - ERD: dbdiagram.io, Lucidchart, or equivalent  
  - API: Swagger/OpenAPI, TypeSpec, Redocly  
  - Data Validation: Joi, Zod, AJV
- **Repository:**  
  - All models, schemas, and migrations stored in Git (src/models, src/schemas, docs/erd)
  - Use semantic versioning for models and APIs.
- **Version Control Strategy:**  
  - Feature-branch workflow for model changes.
  - Tags/releases for major model versions.
  - Scripts for automated migration and rollback.
