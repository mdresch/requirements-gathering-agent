## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This Data Quality Management Plan (DQMP) establishes the framework, processes, and responsibilities for ensuring high data quality throughout the lifecycle of the adpa-enterprise-framework-automation project. The planâ€™s objective is to maintain the integrity, reliability, and usability of all data managed or produced by the system, supporting regulatory compliance (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK), effective automation, and business decision-making.

### 1.2 Scope
This plan applies to all data assets managed by the framework, including project requirements, templates, user information, documents, metadata, integration artifacts (e.g., Adobe, SharePoint), and audit logs, across all environments (development, staging, production).

### 1.3 Objectives
- Define data quality standards and metrics
- Assign clear roles and responsibilities for data quality
- Establish processes for assessing, monitoring, and improving data quality
- Enable transparency through reporting and issue tracking

## 2. Data Quality Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                      | Responsibilities                                                                                   |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Owners**           | Accountable for data assets within their domain; approve changes and resolve escalated issues.    |
| **Data Stewards**         | Coordinate data quality activities; enforce standards; monitor and report on data quality metrics.|
| **Data Quality Analysts** | Profile, measure, and assess data; identify anomalies; recommend remediation actions.             |
| **Developers**            | Implement data validations in code and integration pipelines; remediate technical issues.         |
| **System Administrators** | Support data backup, integrity, and security; restore/recover data as needed.                    |
| **Business Users**        | Identify and report data quality issues; provide business context for data requirements.          |

Roles are mapped to specific team members in the RACI matrix (appendix), and responsibilities are integrated into the DevOps lifecycle.

## 3. Data Quality Dimensions

| Dimension     | Definition                                                                                                                | Example (in context)                                                |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Accuracy**  | Data correctly describes the real-world entity or event.                                                                  | Project requirement fields match actual stakeholder needs.          |
| **Completeness** | All required data is present.                                                                                            | All mandatory fields in templates and API payloads are populated.   |
| **Consistency** | Data is the same across various systems and formats.                                                                      | Requirement status is consistent between API, CLI, and DB.          |
| **Timeliness** | Data is up-to-date and available when needed.                                                                             | Project status updates are reflected in API and user dashboards swiftly. |
| **Uniqueness** | Each data entity is recorded only once; no duplicates exist.                                                              | No duplicate user accounts or requirement IDs.                      |
| **Validity**   | Data conforms to defined formats, ranges, and business rules.                                                             | Email addresses, GUIDs, and date fields adhere to format standards. |

## 4. Data Quality Assessment

### 4.1 Data Profiling
- **Initial Profiling:** Conducted on onboarding new data sources, schemas, or integrations (e.g., Adobe API, SharePoint, external APIs).
- **Automated Profiling:** Leverage tools (e.g., express-validator, joi, zod, ajv) for schema validation and anomaly detection in API payloads.

### 4.2 Data Quality Monitoring
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Automated scripts and middleware (express-winston, morgan, winston) log data anomalies, validation errors, and exceptions.
- **Scheduled Reviews:** Data stewards review key data sets (templates, requirements, user lists) monthly for anomalies and quality trends.

### 4.3 Data Quality Measurement
- **Validation Rules:** Enforced at API, CLI, and DB layers using validation libraries (joi, zod, ajv) and OpenAPI/TypeSpec specifications.
- **Test Automation:** Use Jest and custom test scripts (test:unit, test:performance) for regression and edge-case coverage.
- **Data Sampling:** Periodic random sampling and manual review of records for qualitative assessment.

## 5. Data Quality Issue Management

### 5.1 Identification
- **Automated Detection:** Validation middleware and test suites flag data quality issues in real time.
- **User Reporting:** Issues reported via API error messages, user interface, or ticketing system.

### 5.2 Logging
- **Centralized Log Management:** All data quality incidents logged via winston and stored with metadata (timestamp, type, severity, origin).
- **Issue Tracker:** Use project issue tracker (e.g., GitHub Issues, Azure DevOps) for tracking open/closed status.

### 5.3 Remediation
- **Triage:** Data Quality Analysts and Stewards triage issues by severity and impact.
- **Resolution:** Remediation may involve data correction, code/config fixes, or process updates.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Required for recurring or critical quality incidents.
- **Verification:** Post-remediation validation to confirm resolution before closure.

### 5.4 Escalation and Communication
- **Escalation Path:** Issues not resolved within SLAs are escalated to Data Owners and Project Managers.
- **Communication:** Regular updates provided to stakeholders and affected users.
