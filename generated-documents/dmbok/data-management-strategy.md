## Data Governance Principles

1. **Accountability:** Assign clear ownership for all data domains (documents, templates, user data, integrations).
2. **Transparency:** Document data lineage, transformation logic, and data flows across all automation pipelines.
3. **Integrity:** Enforce validation, version control, and reconciliation at every integration point.
4. **Protection:** Apply least-privilege access, encryption, and regular security reviews for sensitive data.
5. **Compliance:** Monitor regulatory developments and update policies and controls accordingly.
6. **Standardization:** Mandate use of industry-standard schemas (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, DMBOK-aligned taxonomies).
7. **Lifecycle Management:** Define policies for data retention, archival, and disposal.

**Examples:**
- All template changes require review and approval before deployment (see Roles & Responsibilities).
- Integration with SharePoint and Confluence leverages their built-in metadata and versioning for document traceability.

## Data Management Processes

### 1. Data Acquisition & Input

- **Template Management:** All templates versioned and validated using JSON Schema; changes must be peer-reviewed.
- **User Input Validation:** Apply robust front-end (CLI/Web/API) and back-end validation (Joi, Zod) for all user-supplied data.
- **AI Provider Data Flows:** Log prompt/response pairs; redact sensitive data before external AI provider transmission.

### 2. Data Processing & Generation

- **Automated Workflows:** Use pipeline orchestration for document generation with explicit state transitions and error handling.
- **Metadata Enrichment:** Automatically tag generated documents with context (project, author, compliance tags, timestamps).
- **Audit Logging:** Persist structured logs of all critical actions (generation, publishing, integration events).

### 3. Data Storage & Integration

- **Primary Storage:** Store templates and generated documents in a secure, version-controlled repository.
- **Enterprise Integration:** Use well-defined APIs and metadata mapping for SharePoint, Confluence, and Adobe; ensure bidirectional sync where appropriate.
- **Backup & Recovery:** Automated nightly backups of all critical data assets; quarterly disaster recovery drills.

### 4. Data Quality & Validation

- **Automated Testing:** Integrate test suites (Jest, ts-jest) for schema validation, template completeness, and API contract adherence.
- **Manual Review:** Periodic spot checks of document output and metadata completeness.

### 5. Data Retention & Disposal

- **Retention Policies:** Define per-client/document-type retention periods (e.g., 7 years for financial records).
- **Secure Disposal:** Automate secure deletion (using overwrite/shred for sensitive content) per policy and legal requirements.
