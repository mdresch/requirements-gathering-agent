Certainly! Below is a comprehensive, modular **Document & Content Management Framework** tailored for enterprise environments, integrating best practices and aligning with frameworks such as DMBOK, ISO 15489, and regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, etc.). This can be used as a standalone governance document or as a blueprint for implementing/adapting your own policies and technical controls.

# Document & Content Management Framework

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose & Scope
This framework defines the standards, processes, and governance required for the effective management of documents and unstructured content throughout their lifecycle. It applies to all business units, functions, and supporting IT systems, including ADPA and its integrated platforms (SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe, etc.).

### 1.2 Business Drivers
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meet requirements (GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Risk Management:** Minimize loss, unauthorized access, and legal exposure
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline access, retrieval, and collaboration
- **Knowledge Preservation:** Safeguard organizational memory

### 1.3 Objectives
- Standardize document and content practices
- Ensure integrity, availability, confidentiality, and compliance
- Enable effective search, retrieval, and use
- Support audit, legal, and eDiscovery needs
