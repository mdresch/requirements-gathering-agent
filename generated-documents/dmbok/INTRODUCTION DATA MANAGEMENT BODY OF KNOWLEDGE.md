## Coverage Gaps and Improvement Suggestions

### Coverage Gaps
1. Data Governance Charter: No explicit document outlining the overall data governance mission, vision, and guiding principles.
2. Data Lifecycle Management: Limited explicit coverage of end-to-end data lifecycle as a standalone topic.
3. Data Integration & Interoperability: No dedicated document for data integration or movement between systems.
4. Data Operations & Monitoring: Operational aspects such as monitoring and incident management are not detailed.
5. Expanded Architecture Principles: Architectural principles and technology standards could be further detailed.

### Recommendations for Improvement
- Add a Data Governance Charter document.
- Add a dedicated Data Lifecycle Management document.
- Develop a Data Integration & Interoperability Framework.
- Include an Operational Playbook for data management.
- Expand the Data Architecture documentation with principles and reference architectures.
