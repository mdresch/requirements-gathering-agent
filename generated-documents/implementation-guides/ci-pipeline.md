# CI/CD Pipeline Guide: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This guide outlines the CI/CD pipeline for the ADPA project, focusing on automated building, testing, and deployment.  The pipeline leverages the project's modular architecture and existing testing framework to ensure high quality and reliable releases.

## 1. Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline will follow a Gitflow branching model, utilizing GitHub Actions (or a similar platform) for automation.  The pipeline consists of the following stages:

* **Development:**  Triggered by pushes to feature branches.  Focuses on unit and integration testing.
* **Staging:** Triggered by merges into the `develop` branch.  Includes more comprehensive testing (e.g., end-to-end tests), and deployment to a staging environment.
* **Production:** Triggered by merges into the `main` branch.  Deploys the application to the production environment.  This stage may include additional checks and approvals.

## 2. Build Process

The build process will use the project's existing `npm run build` command. This command should:

* Compile TypeScript code.
* Bundle the application (if necessary).
* Generate necessary static assets.
* Create a distributable package (e.g., a `.tgz` archive).

**GitHub Actions (Example):**

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: npm run build
```

## 3. Testing Strategy

The testing strategy will be multi-layered, incorporating:

* **Unit Tests:**  These tests, already present in the project, will verify the functionality of individual modules and functions.  They should be run in the Development and Staging stages.
* **Integration Tests:** These tests will verify the interactions between different modules and components. They should be run in the Development and Staging stages.
* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  These tests, to be implemented, will simulate real-world usage scenarios, verifying the entire application flow. They should be run in the Staging stage.  Consider using a tool like Cypress or Playwright.
* **PMBOK Compliance Tests:**  These tests (to be implemented) will validate the output of the generated documents against PMBOK standards. This could involve using a dedicated PMBOK validation library or custom scripts.

**GitHub Actions (Example):**

```yaml
- name: Run Unit Tests
  run: npm run test:unit

- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: npm run test:integration

- name: Run E2E Tests (Staging only)
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: npm run test:e2e

- name: Run PMBOK Compliance Tests (Staging only)
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
  run: npm run test:pmbok
```

## 4. Deployment Stages

* **Staging Environment:** A separate environment mirroring production, used for testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).  This environment should be automatically provisioned (e.g., using infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or Ansible).
* **Production Environment:** The live environment where users access the application. Deployment to production should ideally be a manual process with appropriate approvals, even with automated pipelines.

## 5. Environment Configuration

Environment-specific configurations (API keys, connection strings, etc.) should be managed securely using environment variables.  Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in the code.  Consider using a secrets management system like GitHub Secrets or Azure Key Vault.

**GitHub Actions (Example):**

```yaml
- name: Set Environment Variables
  uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  with:
    java-version: '17'
    distribution: 'temurin'
  env:
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT: ${{ secrets.AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT }}
    # ... other secrets
```

## 6. Security Checks

The pipeline should include security checks at various stages:

* **Static Code Analysis:** Integrate tools like SonarQube or ESLint to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like Snyk or npm audit to check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
* **Secret Scanning:**  Ensure that secrets are not accidentally committed to the repository. GitHub and other platforms provide built-in secret scanning capabilities.

**GitHub Actions (Example):**

```yaml
- name: Static Code Analysis
  uses: actions/sonarcloud@1
  
- name: Dependency Scanning
  uses: snyk/actions/node@master
```


## 7. Quality Gates

Quality gates are checkpoints in the pipeline that prevent further progress if certain criteria are not met.  Examples include:

* **Test Failures:** The pipeline should stop if unit, integration, or E2E tests fail.
* **Code Coverage:**  Require a minimum level of code coverage (e.g., 80%).
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** The pipeline should halt if security scans reveal critical vulnerabilities.


## 8. Monitoring

Once deployed, the application should be monitored for performance, errors, and security issues.  Implement appropriate logging and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog).  Integrate monitoring alerts into the CI/CD pipeline to trigger notifications in case of problems.

## 9. Rollback Process

Establish a rollback process to quickly revert to a previous working version if a deployment causes issues.  This could involve:

* Versioning the deployed artifacts.
* Maintaining a history of deployments.
* Having a mechanism to automatically or manually deploy a previous version.


## 10. Maintenance

The CI/CD pipeline itself needs regular maintenance:

* Update pipeline scripts as needed.
* Regularly review and update security tools and dependencies.
* Monitor pipeline performance and address bottlenecks.


This guide provides a framework for building a robust CI/CD pipeline for the ADPA project.  Specific tools and configurations will need to be adapted based on the project's infrastructure and requirements.  Remember to prioritize security and maintainability throughout the pipeline's design and implementation.
