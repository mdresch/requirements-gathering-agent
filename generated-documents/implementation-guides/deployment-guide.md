# ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant Deployment Guide

This guide outlines the deployment process for the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) application.  ADPA generates comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, leveraging Azure OpenAI (recommended) or alternative AI providers.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before deploying ADPA, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

* **Node.js:** Version 18.0.0 or higher.
* **npm:**  Node Package Manager, included with Node.js.
* **AI Provider Account:**  An active account with your chosen AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, or Ollama).  API keys and/or authentication credentials will be required. See Section 4 for details.
* **Server Infrastructure:** A server capable of running Node.js applications. This could be a cloud server (AWS, Azure, GCP), a virtual machine, or a dedicated server.  Consider resource requirements based on expected usage and the chosen AI model's token limits.  Larger models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) require significantly more resources.
* **Git (Optional):** If utilizing the built-in Version Control System (VCS) for generated documents, Git must be installed on the server.


## 2. Environment Setup

1. **Server Access:** Obtain SSH access to your deployment server.
2. **Node.js & npm Installation:** If not already present, install Node.js and npm on the server.
3. **Create Deployment Directory:** Create a directory for the ADPA application on the server (e.g., `/opt/adpa`).
4. **User and Permissions:** Create a dedicated user for the ADPA application and set appropriate permissions for the deployment directory.  Avoid running ADPA as root.


## 3. Configuration

1. **`.env` File:** Create a `.env` file in the deployment directory containing your AI provider configuration.  This file should *not* be committed to version control.  Example `.env` files for different providers are provided below.  **Ensure your API keys and credentials are secure.**

   **Azure OpenAI (Recommended):**

   ```
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
   DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4.1-mini  // or your chosen deployment name
   USE_ENTRA_ID=true // or false, depending on your authentication method
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY // Only necessary if USE_ENTRA_ID=false
   ```

   **Google AI Studio:**

   ```
   GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your-google-ai-api-key
   GOOGLE_AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-pro // or gemini-1.5-flash, or another model
   ```

   **GitHub AI:**

   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
   REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini // or your chosen model
   ```

   **Ollama (Local):**

   ```
   AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
   REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_MODEL=llama3.1
   ```

2. **`config-rga.json` (Optional):**  This file allows you to configure various aspects of ADPA, including the VCS settings.  Refer to the project documentation for details.

3. **Other Configuration:**  The `--output` option allows you to specify the output directory for generated documents via the CLI.


## 4. Deployment Steps

1. **Clone Repository:** Clone the ADPA repository to your deployment directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/requirements-gathering-agent.git .
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Application:** Build the ADPA application:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **(Optional) Setup Systemd Service (Linux):** For automatic startup and management, create a systemd service file.  Example:

   `/etc/systemd/system/adpa.service`:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   Description=ADPA Automated Documentation Project Assistant
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   User=adpauser  // Replace with your dedicated user
   Group=adpauser // Replace with your dedicated group
   WorkingDirectory=/opt/adpa // Replace with your deployment directory
   ExecStart=/opt/adpa/node dist/cli.js  // Adjust path if needed
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Enable and start the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable adpa.service
   sudo systemctl start adpa.service
   ```

5. **Run ADPA (Manual):**  Alternatively, you can run ADPA manually using the CLI:

   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js  // or  npx requirements-gathering-agent
   ```

   You can use various command-line options (see project documentation) to control document generation.


## 5. Verification

1. **Check Logs:** Examine the application logs to ensure ADPA started successfully and generated documents without errors.  The location of logs will depend on your server setup.
2. **Inspect Generated Documents:** Verify that the generated documents are complete, accurate, and meet your project requirements.
3. **Test Functionality:** Run ADPA with various command-line options to test different features and document generation scenarios.


## 6. Rollback

In case of deployment failures, revert to a previous working version by:

1. **Using Git:** If you're using Git, revert to a previous commit.
2. **Restoring Backups:** Restore the application from a backup if available.
3. **Manual Correction:** Manually fix any errors and redeploy.


## 7. Monitoring

Monitor ADPA's performance and resource usage.  This includes:

* **CPU and Memory Usage:** Track CPU and memory consumption to identify potential bottlenecks.
* **AI Provider API Calls:** Monitor the number of API calls made to the AI provider to ensure you are within your usage limits.
* **Log Monitoring:** Regularly check the logs for errors or warnings.
* **Document Generation Times:** Track the time it takes to generate documents to identify potential performance issues.


## 8. Troubleshooting

Refer to the project's troubleshooting section in the documentation for common issues and solutions.


## 9. Maintenance

* **Regular Updates:** Keep the ADPA application updated with the latest version to benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features.
* **Security Patches:** Apply security patches promptly to address vulnerabilities.
* **Log Rotation:** Implement log rotation to manage log file size.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Regularly monitor resource usage to optimize performance and prevent issues.


This deployment guide provides a comprehensive overview.  Always refer to the latest project documentation for the most up-to-date information and detailed instructions. Remember to adapt this guide to your specific infrastructure and requirements.
