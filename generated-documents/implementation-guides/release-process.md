## Release Process Document: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Release Management Team


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the release process for the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) software.  This process ensures consistent, reliable, and high-quality releases, minimizing risk and maximizing value delivery.  ADPA's unique features, including its modular architecture and AI integration, necessitate a robust release management strategy.

**2. Release Goals**

* Deliver high-quality, stable releases that meet customer expectations.
* Minimize disruption to users during the release process.
* Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards (as ADPA itself generates PMBOK documents).
* Maintain a consistent and predictable release cadence.
* Facilitate efficient rollback in case of unforeseen issues.

**3. Release Types**

* **Major Release (x.0.0):** Significant new features, architectural changes, or substantial improvements.  Requires extensive testing and communication.
* **Minor Release (x.y.0):**  Enhancements, bug fixes, and minor feature additions.  Requires thorough testing.
* **Patch Release (x.y.z):** Urgent bug fixes or critical security updates.  Requires rapid testing and immediate deployment.

**4. Release Planning**

**4.1. Release Schedule:** The release schedule will be determined based on development velocity, feature completion, and customer feedback. A rolling release plan will be maintained, updated bi-weekly, and communicated to all stakeholders.

**4.2. Feature Freeze:** A feature freeze will be implemented a week prior to the planned release date to allow for focused testing and stabilization.  Exceptions require approval from the Release Manager.

**4.3. Resource Allocation:**  The Release Manager will coordinate resources (developers, testers, documentation writers) needed for testing, deployment, and communication.

**5. Version Control**

ADPA utilizes Git for version control.  A dedicated release branch will be created for each release.  All code changes will be reviewed and approved before merging into the release branch.  The `generated-documents` folder will use its own version control system (VCS) as detailed in the ADPA documentation.


**6. Release Checklist**

This checklist will be used for each release, regardless of type.

**Pre-Release:**

**7. Testing Requirements**

Testing will follow a multi-stage approach:

* **Unit Testing:** Developers perform unit testing during development.
* **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different components of the system.
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the entire system.
* **Regression Testing:** Retesting after bug fixes or code changes to ensure no new issues have been introduced.
* **Performance Testing:** Load and stress testing to ensure scalability and stability.
* **Security Testing:** Penetration testing to identify security vulnerabilities.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Real users test the system in a production-like environment.

**8. Approval Process**

* **Code Review Approval:** Code changes must be approved by at least two developers before merging into the release branch.
* **Testing Sign-off:**  The Test Lead must sign off on the completion of all testing phases.
* **Release Manager Approval:** The Release Manager provides final approval before deployment.

**9. Deployment Steps**

Deployment will follow a well-defined procedure, including:

* **Environment Preparation:** Ensuring the target environment is properly configured.
* **Backup:** Creating a backup of the existing system.
* **Deployment Execution:** Executing the deployment script.
* **Verification:** Verifying the successful deployment and functionality.
* **Post-Deployment Tasks:** Performing any necessary post-deployment tasks.
