## ADPA Code Documentation Standards

These standards ensure consistent, clear, and comprehensive documentation for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  They cover various documentation types, coding styles, and tools to maintain high-quality code and facilitate collaboration.

**1. Documentation Types:**

ADPA utilizes a multi-layered documentation approach:

* **README.md:**  A comprehensive overview of the project, including installation, usage, features, contributing guidelines, and license information.  Follows the existing high-quality README structure as a template.
* **Inline Code Comments:**  Used to explain complex logic, algorithms, and non-obvious code sections within the source code.
* **JSDoc/TypeScript Comments:**  For documenting functions, classes, interfaces, and other code elements.  Leverage TypeScript's type system for enhanced clarity and automatic documentation generation.
* **API Documentation:**  Detailed documentation for the CLI and any exposed APIs, including request/response formats, error handling, and usage examples.  Consider using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI for automated API documentation generation.
* **Architecture Documentation:** A high-level overview of the system architecture, including core components, data flow, and technology stack.  (Existing `ARCHITECTURE.MD` serves as a good model.)
* **Design Documents:** Detailed design specifications for major components or features.
* **Unit Test Documentation:** Each unit test should clearly describe its purpose, expected behavior, and any edge cases it covers.
* **Internal Wiki/Knowledge Base:**  For storing more extensive documentation, tutorials, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.  (Consider using a platform like Notion, Confluence, or a GitHub Wiki.)
* **Changelog (CHANGELOG.md):**  Tracks changes across versions, including features, bug fixes, and improvements.  Follows the existing `CHANGELOG.md` structure as a template.


**2. Code Comments:**

* **Purpose:** To clarify the *why* behind the code, not the *what*.  Assume the reader understands the programming language.
* **Style:** Use concise, grammatically correct sentences.
* **Placement:**  Above the code block they describe.
* **Examples:**

```typescript
// This function retrieves project context from multiple sources, prioritizing README.md.
function getProjectContext(): ProjectContext {
  // ... implementation ...
}

// Handle potential API errors by retrying the request.
try {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  // ... further processing ...
} catch (error) {
  // Log the error and retry if necessary
  console.error("API request failed:", error);
  if (retryCount < maxRetries) {
    // Implement retry logic here
  }
}
```

**3. API Documentation:**

* **Standard:**  Follow the OpenAPI Specification (Swagger) for consistent API documentation.  Tools like Swagger Codegen can generate client SDKs and server stubs.
* **Content:** Include:
    * Endpoint paths and HTTP methods
    * Request parameters and body schemas (using JSON Schema)
    * Response codes and body schemas
    * Authentication requirements
    * Error handling and responses
    * Usage examples (using curl or similar)

**4. README Standards:**

* **Structure:** Follow the existing README structure as a best-practice template.  Maintain a clear and concise format with sections for:
    * Project Description
    * Installation
    * Usage (with examples)
    * Features
    * Contributing
    * License
    * Versioning
    * Dependencies
* **Markdown:** Use consistent and well-formatted Markdown.

**5. Documentation Tools:**

* **JSDoc:** For generating API documentation from inline JSDoc comments.  Integrate with a build process to automatically generate documentation.
* **TypeDoc:** For generating documentation from TypeScript code.  Integrate with a build process for automatic generation.
* **Swagger/OpenAPI:** For defining and documenting APIs.  Use tools like Swagger UI to visualize the API documentation.
* **GitBook/MkDocs:** For creating and managing larger documentation sets, including architecture and design documents.  These tools support multiple output formats and version control.


**6. Version Control:**

* **System:** Git is mandatory.
* **Branching Strategy:**  Use a feature branch workflow for managing changes.
* **Commit Messages:**  Write clear, concise, and informative commit messages.  Follow a consistent format (e.g.,  `feat: Add new document type`, `fix: Resolve API error handling`).
* **Pull Requests:**  Use pull requests for code reviews and collaboration.


**7. Examples:**

All documentation should include relevant code examples demonstrating how to use the features or APIs.  Examples should be concise, self-contained, and easy to understand.

**8. Review Process:**

* **Code Reviews:** Mandatory for all pull requests.  Focus on code quality, readability, functionality, and adherence to coding standards.
* **Documentation Reviews:**  Regular reviews of documentation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and clarity.  Involve multiple stakeholders, including developers, testers, and users.


**9. Maintenance:**

* **Documentation Updates:**  Keep the documentation up-to-date with any code changes.
* **Regular Reviews:**  Schedule regular reviews of the documentation to identify and address any issues.
* **Version Control:**  Use Git to track changes to the documentation.


**10. Best Practices:**

* **Consistency:**  Maintain a consistent style and format throughout all documentation.
* **Clarity:**  Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand documentation.
* **Accuracy:**  Ensure that the documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
* **Completeness:**  Provide complete information, including all necessary details.
* **Accessibility:**  Make the documentation easily accessible to all users.
* **Usability:**  Design the documentation to be easy to use and navigate.


**Tool Configuration:**

The project uses a `.env` file for configuration.  Document all environment variables and their purpose clearly in the README.

**Review Process:**  A formal code review process using pull requests is required.

**Maintenance Plan:**  The documentation will be updated regularly to reflect code changes and user feedback.


This comprehensive documentation standard will ensure ADPA's code and documentation are consistently high-quality, maintainable, and easy to understand.  Regular review and adaptation of these standards are key to their effectiveness.
