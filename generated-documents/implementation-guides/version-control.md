## Version Control Guidelines for the ADPA Project

These guidelines outline best practices for using Git to manage the source code and generated documentation of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  They leverage a Gitflow-inspired workflow adapted for the unique context of ADPA, which generates documents alongside code.

**I. Version Control System (VCS): Git**

We will use Git as our distributed version control system.  All code, configuration files, and relevant documentation (including the README and generated documents) will be managed within a Git repository.  A remote repository (e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) will serve as a central backup and collaboration hub.

**II. Branching Strategy:  A Modified Gitflow**

We will employ a modified Gitflow model tailored for ADPA's document generation capabilities.  This approach balances the need for stable releases with the frequent updates inherent in AI-driven document generation.

* **`main` (or `master`):** This branch always reflects the latest stable release of the ADPA application.  Only tagged releases should be merged into `main`.

* **`develop`:** This branch integrates completed features and bug fixes from feature branches. It serves as the integration branch for continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.  Generated documents from `develop` should be considered "pre-release" versions.

* **Feature Branches:**  These branches are created from `develop` for each new feature, bug fix, or significant enhancement.  Branch names should follow a clear convention (e.g., `feature/add-new-document-type`, `bugfix/resolve-context-issue`).  Generated documents within feature branches are specific to that branch's changes.

* **Release Branches:**  Created from `develop` to prepare for a new release.  These branches are used for final testing, documentation updates (including generated documents), and minor bug fixes before merging into `main`.  The release branch's generated documentation reflects the final state for the release.

* **Hotfix Branches:**  Created from `main` to address critical bugs in a released version.  Changes are directly merged into both `main` and `develop` after thorough testing.  Generated documents are updated as needed to reflect the hotfix.

**III. Commit Guidelines**

* **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should focus on a single, logical change. This improves code readability and simplifies debugging.

* **Clear and Concise Messages:** Commit messages should clearly describe the changes made, including a brief summary in the first line (50 characters or less) followed by a more detailed explanation if needed.  Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix: Resolve context issue," not "Fixed: Context issue resolved").

* **Consistent Formatting:** Use a consistent formatting style for commit messages (e.g., using prefixes like "feat:", "fix:", "docs:", "refactor:", "test:").

**IV. Pull Request (PR) Process**

All changes must be submitted via pull requests.

1. **Create a PR:**  Create a PR from your feature branch to `develop` (or `main` for hotfixes).

2. **Code Review:**  At least one other developer should review the code before merging.  Pay close attention to generated documents for accuracy and consistency.

3. **Testing:**  Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested before merging.  This includes testing the generated documentation for accuracy and completeness.

4. **Merge:**  Once the PR is approved and tested, merge it into the target branch (`develop` or `main`).

**V. Code Review Process**

* **Thorough Examination:** Reviewers should carefully examine the code for correctness, readability, efficiency, and adherence to coding standards.

* **Document Review:**  Generated documents within the PR should be reviewed for accuracy, consistency, and completeness relative to the code changes.  Pay close attention to any changes in the context management system that might affect document generation.

* **Constructive Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback to the author, focusing on improving the code and documentation.

**VI. Merge Process**

* **Squash and Merge (for Feature Branches):**  Squash and merge feature branches into `develop` to maintain a cleaner history on `develop`.

* **Merge Commits (for Hotfixes and Release Branches):** Use merge commits for hotfix and release branches to preserve the history of changes.

**VII. Release Tagging**

* **Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning (e.g., major.minor.patch) for releases.

* **Tagging:** Create a Git tag for each release, including a descriptive message.  This tag should be associated with the commit on `main` that represents the release.

**VIII. Conflict Resolution**

* **Address Conflicts Promptly:**  Resolve merge conflicts promptly and efficiently.

* **Communicate:**  Clearly communicate with other developers involved in resolving conflicts.

**IX. Best Practices**

* **Regular Commits:** Commit changes frequently to avoid large, unwieldy commits.

* **Descriptive Branch Names:**  Use descriptive branch names that clearly indicate the purpose of the branch.

* **Keep Branches Up-to-Date:** Regularly rebase or merge your branches with `develop` to avoid large merge conflicts.

* **Use a CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing and deployment using a CI/CD pipeline.  This pipeline should include checks for the accuracy and consistency of generated documents.


**X. Common Issues and Solutions**

* **Merge Conflicts:**  Use a merge tool to resolve conflicts.  Ensure the generated documents are correctly updated after resolving conflicts.

* **Incorrect Document Generation:**  Review the context management system and AI provider configurations.  Check for changes in input data or templates that may have caused inaccuracies.

* **Large Commits:** Break down large commits into smaller, more manageable commits.

* **Unclear Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that accurately describe the changes.

* **Missing Documentation:**  Make sure all necessary documentation (including generated documents) is included in the PR.


**XI.  Generated Document Version Control (Leveraging ADPA's Built-in VCS)**

ADPA's built-in VCS (version 2.1.3+) provides automatic versioning for generated documents.  This should be used in conjunction with the branching strategy described above.  Generated documents should be considered part of the project's overall history and should be reviewed as part of the PR process.  The `requirements-gathering-agent vcs` commands provide tools for managing this version history.  However, it's crucial to understand that this local Git repository is *supplementary* to the main project repository.  Avoid directly committing changes to the generated documents within the main repository; instead, rely on the ADPA's built-in VCS for tracking these changes locally and optionally syncing them to a separate remote repository if needed for audit trails or collaborative document editing.


By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure a clean, well-organized, and easily maintainable Git repository for the ADPA project, promoting collaboration, efficient development, and high-quality documentation.
