# Requirement Traceability Matrix

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

This matrix traces requirements from the project's README and other documentation to the generated documents and features.  Due to the dynamic nature of AI-generated content, specific text matches are not guaranteed, but the matrix shows the intended relationship between requirements and outputs.  Relevance scores indicate the likelihood of a requirement influencing specific documents (higher score = higher likelihood).


| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Requirement Type | Source Document | Relevance Score | Traceability (Generated Document) | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Generate PMBOK-compliant project charter | Functional | README | 100 | `generated-documents/project-charter/ProjectCharter.md` | Complete |  |
| FR-2 | Generate PMBOK-compliant documents (stakeholder register, scope management plan, etc.) | Functional | README | 100 | `generated-documents/stakeholder-management/`, `generated-documents/scope-management/`, `generated-documents/risk-management/`, `generated-documents/planning-artifacts/` | Complete | Multiple documents generated. |
| FR-3 | Secure Azure AI integration using managed identities | Functional | README | 95 |  N/A (Internal implementation) | Complete |  Not a directly generated document, but a core system requirement. |
| FR-4 | Output validated JSON format | Functional | README | 90 | N/A (Internal validation) | In Progress | JSON output currently not a standard output format, but a planned feature. |
| FR-5 | Provide CLI for invocation and configuration | Functional | README | 100 |  N/A (CLI functionality) | Complete |  Not a document, but a core system component. |
| FR-6 | Perform schema validation on generated outputs | Functional | README | 95 | N/A (Internal validation) | In Progress |  Validation is in place, but the level of schema validation may need further refinement. |
