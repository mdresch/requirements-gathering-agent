# Requirement Traceability Matrix

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


This matrix traces requirements from the project's README and other documentation to specific design and implementation elements.  Due to the extensive nature of the project documentation, this matrix focuses on key requirements and illustrative examples.  A more comprehensive matrix would require a dedicated effort and potentially automated tools.


| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Source Document | Type | Priority | Status | Design Element | Implementation Element | Verification Method | Test Case ID |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Generate PMBOK-compliant Project Charter | README | Functional | High | Implemented | `ProjectCharterProcessor.ts` | `generateProjectCharter()` | Automated PMBOK validation, manual review | TC-001 |
| FR-2 | Generate PMBOK-compliant Stakeholder Register | README | Functional | High | Implemented | `StakeholderRegisterProcessor.ts` | `generateStakeholderRegister()` | Manual review, data completeness check | TC-002 |
| FR-3 | Integrate with Azure OpenAI securely using managed identities | README | Functional | High | Implemented | `AzureOpenAIProvider.ts` | `azureOpenAI.create()` | Security audit, successful API calls | TC-003 |
| FR-4 | Output in validated JSON format | README | Functional | High | Implemented | JSON schema definition | `validateJSONOutput()` | Schema validation, data integrity checks | TC-004 |
| FR-5 | Provide CLI for configuration and invocation | README | Functional | High | Implemented | `cli.ts`, `cli-main.ts` | Command-line parsing, function calls | CLI testing, functional usage | TC-005 |
| NF-1 | System must be robust and handle errors gracefully | README | Non-Functional | High | Implemented | Error handling mechanisms in each processor | `try...catch` blocks, retry logic | Error injection testing, log analysis | TC-006 |
| NF-2 | System should generate documents with high quality and accuracy | README | Non-Functional | High | In Progress | Enhanced Context Manager, AI prompt engineering | AI model selection, prompt optimization | Human evaluation, quality scoring | TC-007 |
| NF-3 | System must support multiple AI providers | README | Non-Functional | High | Implemented | `ProviderFactory.ts` | Dynamic provider selection | Testing with different providers | TC-008, TC-009, TC-010 |
| ARCH-1 | Modular architecture for extensibility | README, ARCHITECTURE.md | Architectural | High | Implemented | Processor architecture, `processor-config.json` | Plugin system, dynamic loading | Code review, successful plugin integration | TC-011 |
| TECH-1 | Use TypeScript for development | README | Technical | High | Implemented | Project codebase | TypeScript compiler, type checking | Code analysis, static analysis |  |
| US-1 | As a project manager, I want to generate a project charter so I can formally initiate the project. | 01_PROJECT_CONTEXT_FROM_README.MD | User Story | High | Implemented |  |  | Manual review, PMBOK compliance check | TC-012 |
| US-2 | As a business analyst, I want the system to generate a stakeholder register so I can effectively manage stakeholder engagement. | 01_PROJECT_CONTEXT_FROM_README.MD | User Story | High | Implemented |  |  | Manual review, data completeness check | TC-013 |


**Legend:**

* **Requirement ID:** Unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Requirement Description:** Clear and concise description of the requirement.
* **Source Document:** Document where the requirement is originally defined.
* **Type:** Functional, Non-Functional, User Story, Architectural, Technical
* **Priority:** High, Medium, Low
* **Status:** Implemented, In Progress, Not Started, Deferred, Cancelled
* **Design Element:**  Component or module responsible for fulfilling the requirement.
* **Implementation Element:** Specific function or code responsible for fulfilling the requirement.
* **Verification Method:** How the requirement will be verified.
* **Test Case ID:** Identifier for associated test cases.


**Note:** This is a partial example.  A complete RTM would include all requirements identified in the project documentation and their corresponding design and implementation elements.  The relevance scores from the provided text were used to prioritize which requirements to include in this sample matrix.  The Test Case IDs are placeholders and should be replaced with actual test case identifiers.
