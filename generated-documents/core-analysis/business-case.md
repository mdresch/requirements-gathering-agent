|--------------------------|----------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Development              | $50,000  |                        | One-time cost                                                            |
| Azure AI Services (Annual)| $5,000   |                        | Estimated annual cost based on projected usage                             |
| Maintenance (Annual)     | $2,000   |                        | Ongoing maintenance and support                                           |
| **Total Project Cost**   | **$57,000** |                        |                                                                         |
| Time Savings (per project)|          | $10,000                | Based on 20 hours saved per project at $50/hour; 10 projects per year    |
| Improved Project Success|          | $20,000                | Estimated increase in revenue from successful project completion (10%) |
| **Total Annual Benefit** |          | **$30,000**            |                                                                         |


**ROI Calculation:**

* Total Annual Benefit: $30,000
* Total Project Cost: $57,000
* ROI = (Total Annual Benefit - Total Project Cost) / Total Project Cost = ($30,000 - $57,000) / $57,000 = -0.47 or -47% (Year 1)
* ROI = (Total Annual Benefit * 2 - Total Project Cost)/ Total Project Cost = ($30,000*2 - $57,000) / $57,000 = 0.526 or 53% (Year 2)
* ROI = (Total Annual Benefit * 3 - Total Project Cost)/ Total Project Cost = ($30,000*3 - $57,000) / $57,000 = 1.526 or 153% (Year 3)

**Payback Period:** Approximately 2 years (based on annual savings exceeding annual costs).
