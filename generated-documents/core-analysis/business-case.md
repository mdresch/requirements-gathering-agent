## Business Need and Opportunity  

### Current State Analysis and Pain Points  
Creating PMBOK-compliant documentation is currently a manual and labor-intensive process that is prone to errors and inconsistencies. This results in delays, compliance risks, and misaligned stakeholder expectations. The administrative burden often detracts from higher-value activities such as strategic planning and risk management.  

### Market Opportunity and Competitive Landscape  
The project management software market is growing rapidly, driven by the need for automation and compliance. Competitors primarily offer template-based solutions, which lack the dynamic capabilities and AI-driven insights provided by the Requirements Gathering Agent. This tool offers a unique value proposition by integrating best practices, compliance validation, and stakeholder-specific insights.  

### Business Problem Statement  
Organizations face significant inefficiencies and compliance risks in project documentation. There is a critical need for a solution that automates documentation creation while adhering to PMBOK standards.  

### Urgency and Timing Considerations  
With increasing regulatory scrutiny and growing demand for project governance, the urgency for a compliant and efficient solution is high. Early investment will enable the organization to capture market share and establish leadership in AI-powered project management tools.
