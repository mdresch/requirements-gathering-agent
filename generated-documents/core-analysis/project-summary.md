## Requirements Gathering Agent: Project Summary and Goals

### Project Summary

The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered command-line tool designed to automate the generation of comprehensive project management documentation conforming to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  It leverages multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and a sophisticated context management system to analyze existing project documentation (beyond just the README) and generate a suite of 29 professional documents.  Target users include project managers and business analysts seeking to streamline documentation workflows, improve accuracy, and ensure PMBOK compliance. The tool offers features such as intelligent source discovery, relevance scoring, cross-document consistency checks, quality assessment, and a built-in version control system.  The project has achieved significant market validation, boasting 175 weekly downloads on NPM.  It employs a modular architecture allowing for easy extension and customization.
