## Requirements Gathering Agent: Project Summary and Goals

### Project Summary

The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered command-line tool designed to automate the generation of comprehensive project management documentation adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  It leverages Azure OpenAI (with support for Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) to analyze existing project documentation (extending beyond the README file to include requirements documents, architecture specifications, stakeholder information, and other relevant files) and generate a suite of 29 professional documents.  The tool prioritizes discovered files based on relevance scoring (0-100), intelligently manages context for optimal AI performance, and performs validation against PMBOK standards, providing detailed quality assessments and recommendations.  The target users are project managers and business analysts seeking to streamline their documentation workflows and ensure PMBOK compliance.  The tool is built using TypeScript and Node.js, offering a robust, enterprise-ready solution with features like retry logic and multiple AI provider support.


### Project Goals

* **Increase efficiency in project documentation:**  Automate the creation of PMBOK-compliant documents, reducing manual effort and time spent on documentation.
* **Improve documentation quality and consistency:** Ensure consistent application of PMBOK standards and high-quality output across all generated documents.
* **Reduce project risks:**  Early identification of gaps and inconsistencies in project documentation, minimizing risks associated with incomplete or inaccurate information.
* **Enhance stakeholder alignment:** Facilitate better communication and understanding among stakeholders by providing comprehensive and easily accessible documentation.
* **Generate revenue through sales and subscriptions:** Achieve market penetration and generate revenue through sales of the tool.


**User-Centric Goals and Outcomes:**

* **Simplified documentation process:** Provide a user-friendly tool that simplifies and streamlines the creation of project documentation.
* **Improved accuracy and completeness:** Generate accurate and complete PMBOK-compliant documents, reducing errors and omissions.
* **Enhanced collaboration:** Facilitate better collaboration among project teams by providing a centralized and easily accessible repository of project documentation.
* **Increased productivity:** Free up project managers and business analysts from time-consuming manual tasks, allowing them to focus on higher-value activities.


**Technical and Architectural Goals:**

* **Robust and scalable architecture:** Design and implement a scalable and maintainable architecture capable of handling large projects and diverse documentation sources.
* **Support for multiple AI providers:** Provide flexibility and resilience by supporting multiple AI providers, ensuring continued functionality even if one provider experiences issues.
* **High context utilization:** Optimize the use of AI models' context windows to maximize the accuracy and completeness of generated documents.
* **Comprehensive validation and quality assessment:** Implement robust validation and quality assessment mechanisms to ensure PMBOK compliance and high-quality output.


**Quality and Performance Targets:**

* **High PMBOK compliance:** Achieve a high level of compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **High document quality scores:** Achieve high quality scores (above 90) for generated documents.
* **Fast generation times:** Minimize the time required to generate PMBOK documentation.
* **Low error rates:** Minimize the number of errors and omissions in generated documents.


**Success Criteria and Metrics:**

* **Number of downloads and active users:** Track the number of downloads and active users to measure market adoption.
* **User satisfaction:** Gather user feedback to assess satisfaction with the tool's features and performance.
* **PMBOK compliance rate:** Measure the percentage of generated documents that meet PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Document quality scores:** Track the average quality scores for generated documents.
* **Time savings:** Measure the time saved by users compared to manual documentation creation.


### Strategic Alignment

The Requirements Gathering Agent aligns with the broader business strategy of improving project management efficiency and effectiveness.  The project addresses a significant market need for automated and standardized project documentation, particularly in organizations adopting Agile and PMBOK methodologies.
