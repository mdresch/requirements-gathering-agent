# Project Statement of Work

## Project Description

### Comprehensive Overview of the Project
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript module designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. Leveraging cutting-edge AI models such as Azure OpenAI GPT and Google Gemini, this tool aims to streamline documentation creation, improve compliance, and enhance stakeholder alignment.

### Business Context and Background
Traditionally, project management documentation is created manually, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent across teams. The increasing complexity of modern projects demands a faster, more standardized, and automated approach to documentation generation. The Requirements Gathering Agent addresses this need by utilizing AI to produce professional artifacts aligned with PMBOK standards.

### Problem Statement and Opportunity
Manual documentation workflows lead to delays, compliance risks, and misaligned stakeholder expectations. This inefficiency impacts project success rates and increases administrative overhead. The Requirements Gathering Agent provides an opportunity to transform this process with automation, delivering PMBOK-compliant documents at scale while ensuring accuracy and governance.

### High-Level Solution Approach
The Requirements Gathering Agent integrates with multiple AI providers to analyze project context, extract requirements, and generate comprehensive documentation. Its modular architecture and CLI interface make it adaptable to various workflows, while its validation features ensure compliance with PMBOK standards. Enhanced context management enables the tool to utilize up to 90% of AI model capacity for improved outputs.

## Project Scope

### What Is Included in the Project
- Development and deployment of a CLI-based tool for automated PMBOK-compliant documentation generation.
- Integration with multiple AI providers, including Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama.
- Enhanced context management system for intelligent document generation based on project metadata.
- Generation of 29 PMBOK-compliant documents, including project charters, stakeholder registers, risk management plans, and WBS dictionaries.
- Validation features to ensure PMBOK compliance, document quality, and cross-document consistency.

### What Is Explicitly Excluded from the Project
- Direct integration with third-party project management tools (e.g., MS Project, JIRA) beyond JSON export for interoperability.
- Development of AI models (the tool will leverage existing AI services).
- Training or certification on PMBOK standards for users.
- Support for non-PMBOK documentation frameworks or methodologies.

### Key Deliverables and Outcomes
- **Requirements Gathering Agent CLI**: A functional and tested Node.js module.
- **Generated Documentation**: A suite of PMBOK-compliant documents, validated for quality and consistency.
- **User Documentation**: Tutorials, implementation guides, and troubleshooting manuals for onboarding.
- **Validation Reports**: Quality assurance outputs, including compliance and consistency metrics.

### Performance Requirements and Constraints
- High accuracy and compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
- Minimal runtime for document generation (target: <5 minutes per full suite).
- Scalable architecture supporting projects of varying sizes and complexities.
