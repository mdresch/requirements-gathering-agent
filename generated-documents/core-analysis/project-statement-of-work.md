## Project Statement of Work: Requirements Gathering Agent Enhancements and Documentation

**Project ID:** RGA-Enhancements-2024

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Company]


### 1. Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  The current RGA, while successful (175 weekly NPM downloads), requires enhancements to its core functionality, context management, and documentation to meet growing user needs and maintain its competitive edge.  This project addresses identified issues (detailed in the project README), implements suggested improvements, and delivers comprehensive documentation for the enhanced system.  The overall goal is to solidify the RGA's position as a leading AI-driven project documentation solution.


### 2. Project Scope

* Enhancement of the RGA's core functionality based on identified issues and suggested improvements (detailed in the project README). This includes improvements to the context manager,  project analysis, and document generation engine.
* Implementation of an interactive AI provider selection menu.
* Development of comprehensive documentation, including updated user guides, technical documentation, and API specifications.
* Thorough testing and validation of all enhanced features and new documentation.
* Deployment of the enhanced RGA to NPM.

**Excluded:**

* Development of entirely new features beyond those specified in the project README.
* Integration with third-party project management tools (future phase).
* Extensive UI development (CLI enhancements only).
* Support for new AI providers beyond those currently supported (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
