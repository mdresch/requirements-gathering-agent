## Project Statement of Work: Requirements Gathering Agent Enhancement and Expansion

**Prepared for:** [Stakeholder Name/Organization]
**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Organization]
**Date:** October 26, 2024
**Version:** 1.0


### 1. Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing and expanding the existing "Requirements Gathering Agent" (RGA) tool, a Node.js/TypeScript CLI application that leverages AI to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  The current RGA boasts 175 weekly downloads on NPM, demonstrating strong market validation. This project addresses identified limitations and incorporates user feedback to improve functionality, scalability, and user experience.  The core problem is the need for a more robust, efficient, and user-friendly tool for generating comprehensive project documentation that adheres to PMBOK standards. The opportunity lies in expanding the capabilities of the RGA to address a wider range of project management needs and integrate with a broader set of AI providers.  The solution involves implementing several key improvements detailed in the subsequent sections.


### 2. Project Scope

**Included:**

* **Enhancements to the Enhanced Context Manager:**  Implementation of asynchronous context population, user-configurable context strategies, context pruning, and more granular metrics as detailed in the project README.
* **Improvements to `llmProcessor.ts` and `contextManager.ts`:**  Implementation of AI-powered summarization, dynamic context mapping, async context assembly, context utilization metrics, context pruning/ranking, user-configurable token limits, and support for additional context types.
* **Interactive AI Provider Selection Menu:** Development and integration of an interactive CLI menu for selecting AI providers.
* **Improved Error Handling and Logging:** Enhanced error handling and logging mechanisms throughout the application.
* **Expanded Documentation:**  Comprehensive updates to existing documentation and creation of new documentation as needed, including a detailed user manual and API reference.
* **Testing and Validation:**  Thorough unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure quality and PMBOK compliance.  This includes testing across all supported AI providers.
* **Deployment to NPM:**  Publishing the updated RGA to NPM.

**Excluded:**

* Development of entirely new document generation templates beyond those currently specified.
* Integration with third-party project management software (this is considered a future phase).
* Support for non-markdown document types as input (e.g., .docx, .pdf).  This is a potential future enhancement.


**Key Deliverables:**

* Updated RGA source code with all enhancements implemented.
* Comprehensive documentation including a user manual and API reference.
* Successfully deployed RGA package on NPM.
* A completed and approved test plan with successful test results.
