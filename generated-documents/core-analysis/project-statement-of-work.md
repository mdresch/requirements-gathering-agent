## Project Statement of Work: Requirements Gathering Agent Enhancement & Validation

**Project ID:** RGA-Enhancement-V2.1.3

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Company Name]


### 1. Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), a Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool that leverages AI to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation. The current version (v2.1.1) has achieved significant traction (175 weekly NPM downloads), demonstrating market demand. This enhancement project addresses identified issues, implements requested features, and further refines the tool's performance and user experience.  The project will also include rigorous validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards.  The core enhancement will focus on improving the AI context management system to increase accuracy and efficiency.


### 2. Project Scope

**Included:**

* **Enhancement of the Enhanced Context Manager:**  Implementation of suggested improvements outlined in the project README (Asynchronous context population, user-configurable context strategies, context pruning, more granular metrics, etc.) within `llmProcessor.ts` and `contextManager.ts`.
* **Implementation of a User-Friendly AI Provider Selection Menu:**  Creation of an interactive CLI menu allowing users to select their preferred AI provider (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) without manual `.env` file editing.
* **Comprehensive PMBOK 7.0 Validation:**  Implementation of robust validation checks across all generated documents to ensure compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This includes completeness checks, terminology validation, and cross-document consistency checks.  Generation of detailed validation reports.
* **Bug Fixes:** Resolution of outstanding issues as documented in the project README (zero tokens in context, CLI permission errors, etc.).
* **Documentation Updates:**  Updating existing documentation to reflect enhancements and additions.  Creation of new documentation for the provider selection menu and validation processes.  This includes updated user guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting guides.
* **Testing and Quality Assurance:**  Rigorous unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure functionality, stability, and PMBOK compliance.

**Explicitly Excluded:**

* Development of entirely new document generation capabilities beyond those currently supported.
* Integration with third-party project management tools (future phase).
* Support for non-markdown documentation sources (future phase).
* Major architectural changes to the core RGA system.


**Key Deliverables:**

* Enhanced Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) software (v2.1.3).
* Comprehensive documentation (user guide, technical guide, API documentation, validation reports).
* Updated unit and integration tests.
* Deployment package for NPM.


### 3. Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives (SMART):**

* Deliver a fully functional and tested version of RGA (v2.1.3) by [Date - e.g., November 22, 2024].
* Achieve 95% code coverage through unit and integration tests.
* All generated documents must pass PMBOK 7.0 validation with a score of 90% or higher.
* The new provider selection menu must be user-friendly and intuitive, with a successful usability test demonstrating 100% comprehension by 5 test users.

**Secondary Objectives:**

* Improve the average context utilization of large language models by 20%.
* Reduce the number of reported bugs by 50% compared to the previous version.

**Success Metrics and KPIs:**

* Number of successful test cases passed.
* PMBOK validation scores.
* User feedback on the provider selection menu.
* Post-release bug reports.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Successful completion of all unit and integration tests.
