## Project Statement of Work: Requirements Gathering Agent Enhancement and Expansion

**Project ID:** RGA-Enhancement-2024

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Prepared By:** [Your Name/Company]


### 1. Project Description

This project focuses on enhancing and expanding the existing Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) tool.  The current RGA, a Node.js/TypeScript CLI application, leverages AI to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project README files and associated documentation. This project will build upon this foundation by addressing several key areas identified through user feedback and internal analysis: improving the AI context management system, expanding the range of generated documents, enhancing the user interface, and implementing robust validation and testing procedures.  The primary goal is to solidify the RGA's position as a leading tool for automated project documentation and to expand its market reach.

The business context is a rapidly growing need for efficient and accurate project documentation, particularly in regulated industries and large-scale projects.  The opportunity lies in providing a superior, AI-powered solution that surpasses current market offerings in terms of accuracy, completeness, and ease of use.  The solution approach will involve iterative development, focusing on incremental improvements and rigorous testing throughout the process.


### 2. Project Scope

**Included:**

* Enhancement of the existing Enhanced Context Manager to improve context utilization and accuracy for various AI models (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude).  This includes implementing asynchronous processing for large projects and providing more granular control over context parameters.
* Expansion of the RGA's document generation capabilities to include additional PMBOK-aligned artifacts, such as a detailed Project KickOff Preparations Checklist.
* Improvement of the CLI interface to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, including an interactive AI provider selection menu.
* Implementation of more comprehensive unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and stability.
* Refinement of the existing PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation process to improve accuracy and provide more actionable feedback.
* Documentation updates, including a comprehensive user manual and API documentation.

**Explicitly Excluded:**

* Development of entirely new, unrelated features beyond those explicitly listed above.
* Integration with third-party project management software (this may be considered in a future phase).
* Support for non-markdown based project documentation.
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).


**Key Deliverables and Outcomes:**

* Enhanced RGA application with improved context management, expanded document generation capabilities, and enhanced CLI.
* Comprehensive unit and integration test suite achieving 95% code coverage.
* Updated and expanded user documentation.
* A production-ready release candidate of the enhanced RGA application.


**Performance Requirements and Constraints:**

* The enhanced RGA should maintain or improve upon the existing performance characteristics.
* The application must be compatible with Node.js 18.0.0 or higher.
* The application must be compatible with major AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).


### 3. Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives (SMART Goals):**

* **Objective 1:**  Increase the average context utilization of the Enhanced Context Manager by 25% for large language models (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude) within 3 months.
* **Objective 2:**  Release a new version of the RGA with at least three new document generation templates within 4 months.
* **Objective 3:** Achieve a 95% unit and integration test coverage within 4 months.

**Secondary Objectives:**

* Improve user satisfaction ratings by 15% based on post-release user surveys.
* Increase weekly downloads on npm by 50% within 6 months of the release.

**Success Metrics and KPIs:**

* Context utilization percentage.
* Number of new document templates implemented.
* Test coverage percentage.
* User satisfaction survey results.
* Weekly npm downloads.

**Acceptance Criteria for Project Completion:**

* All primary objectives are met.
* The enhanced RGA passes all unit and integration tests.
* User documentation is complete and accurate.
* A stable release candidate is ready for deployment.
