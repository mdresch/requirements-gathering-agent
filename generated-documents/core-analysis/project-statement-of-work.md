## Project Statement of Work: Requirements Gathering Agent Enhancement & Expansion

**Project ID:** RGA-Enhancement-2024

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Prepared by:** [Your Name/Company]


### 1. Project Description

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) is an AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project metadata and existing documentation.  This project focuses on enhancing the existing RGA functionality and expanding its capabilities based on user feedback and market demands.  The core problem addressed is the significant time and effort required for manual creation of project documentation, leading to inconsistencies and potential risks. RGA offers a solution by automating this process, resulting in standardized, accurate, and timely documentation.  This project will build upon the existing success of RGA (currently boasting 175 weekly downloads), solidifying its position as a leading tool in AI-driven project management documentation.

### 2. Project Scope

**Included:**

* **Enhancement of existing features:**  This includes improving the accuracy and efficiency of the existing document generation engine, enhancing the context manager for larger language models (LLMs), refining the PMBOK compliance validation, and improving the overall user experience of the CLI.  Specific enhancements include addressing outstanding issues (detailed in the project README), implementing asynchronous parallelization for large projects, and improving the AI-powered summarization capabilities within the context manager.
* **Expansion of functionality:** This involves adding new document types (e.g., a Project KickOff Preparations Checklist), improving the modular architecture to allow for easier addition of future document types and AI providers, and implementing an interactive AI provider selection menu.
* **Comprehensive testing and validation:** Rigorous testing will be performed to ensure the quality and reliability of all enhancements and new features.  This includes unit tests, integration tests, and performance testing.  PMBOK 7.0 compliance will be rigorously validated.
* **Updated documentation:**  The project documentation will be updated to reflect all changes and enhancements.

**Explicitly Excluded:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (beyond existing JSON output).  This will be considered in future phases.
* Development of entirely new core functionalities outside of the defined enhancements and expansions.
* Support for non-markdown input formats (beyond the current Markdown analysis capabilities).

**Key Deliverables:**

* Enhanced Requirements Gathering Agent software (version 2.2.0)
* Comprehensive test suite with high coverage
* Updated documentation (README, API docs, user guide)
* Project closure report
