# Project Statement of Work

## Project Description

### Overview  
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript application designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. With integration into Azure OpenAI and other AI providers, the tool enables project managers and business analysts to produce standardized, high-quality documentation efficiently. The tool leverages advanced context management techniques to analyze project data comprehensively, ensuring compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards while maintaining cross-document consistency.

### Business Context and Background  
Project documentation is often created manually, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and inconsistencies that impact project success rates. Medium and large organizations frequently struggle with meeting industry standards such as PMBOK, increasing administrative overhead and compliance risks. The Requirements Gathering Agent addresses these challenges by automating documentation workflows, ensuring alignment with global project management standards.

### Problem Statement and Opportunity  
Manual documentation processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent. This results in delays, non-compliance, and misaligned stakeholder expectations. The **Requirements Gathering Agent** provides an opportunity to:
- Automate documentation generation using AI-powered insights.
- Enhance compliance with PMBOK standards.
- Improve project efficiency, reducing administrative overhead.

### High-Level Solution Approach  
The tool will integrate with Azure OpenAI and other AI services to analyze project documentation, extract relevant context, and generate PMBOK-compliant documents. It will support a modular architecture, CLI-based interaction, and validation mechanisms to ensure documentation quality and compliance.

## Project Scope

### In-Scope  
The following activities and deliverables are included in the project:
1. Development of a CLI-based tool for generating PMBOK-compliant documentation.
2. Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).
3. Automated discovery and analysis of project documentation files.
4. Generation of key PMBOK documents, including:
   - Project Charter
   - Stakeholder Register
   - Scope Management Plan
   - Requirements Management Plan
   - Risk Management Plan
   - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary
   - Milestone List
5. Comprehensive PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation for generated documents.
6. User documentation, tutorials, and onboarding support.

### Out-of-Scope  
The following are explicitly excluded from the project:
1. Custom integrations with third-party tools beyond the modular architecture framework.
2. Development of non-PMBOK-specific documentation templates.
3. Support for non-TypeScript or non-Node.js environments.
4. Real-time collaboration features or live editing capabilities.
5. AI model training or customization beyond existing providers.

### Key Deliverables and Outcomes  
- A functional CLI tool capable of generating PMBOK-compliant documentation.
- Validated PMBOK-compliant documents organized in professional directories.
- Enhanced context management system for comprehensive project analysis.
- Documentation of installation, configuration, and usage.

### Performance Requirements and Constraints  
- Generated documents must adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
- CLI tool must support environments running Node.js 18.0 or higher.
- Integration with AI providers must ensure secure authentication and robust error handling.
