## Task Management System - User Stories

**I. Task Creation and Assignment**

**A. Task Creator**

        * The system allows me to select a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
        * The system allows me to assign the task to one or more team members from a selectable list.
    * **Notes:** Depends on user authentication and team member management features.


2. **As a** project manager, **I want** to be able to set a recurring task, **so that** I can automate repetitive tasks.
    * **Priority:** Should Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows me to specify a recurrence pattern (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
        * The system allows me to define an end date for the recurring task.
        * Recurring tasks are created automatically according to the defined pattern.
        * The system handles overlapping recurring tasks appropriately.
        * The system allows modification of recurring task properties.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on task creation and due date management functionality.


3. **As a** team member, **I want** to be notified when a new task is assigned to me, **so that** I am aware of my responsibilities.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system sends an email notification upon task assignment.
        * The notification includes task title, due date, and assigned-by information.
        * Users can configure notification preferences (e.g., email, in-app notification).
        * The notification is delivered within 5 minutes of task assignment.
        * Users can mark notifications as read.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on notification system and user settings.


**B. Task Assignee**

4. **As a** team member, **I want** to accept or reject assigned tasks, **so that** I can manage my workload effectively.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system displays a clear indication of assigned tasks.
        * The system provides options to accept or reject an assigned task.
        * Upon acceptance, the task's status updates accordingly.
        * Upon rejection, the task is returned to the assigner.
        * The system provides feedback to the user upon task acceptance/rejection.
    * **Notes:** Depends on task assignment and status update functionality.


**II. Progress Tracking and Collaboration**

5. **As a** project manager, **I want** to view the progress of all tasks in a project, **so that** I can monitor overall project health.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system provides a dashboard view of all tasks with their status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
        * The dashboard displays a visual representation of progress (e.g., progress bar).
        * The system allows filtering and sorting of tasks by various criteria (e.g., due date, priority, assignee).
        * The system provides aggregated project progress metrics.
        * The system allows exporting the progress data (e.g., CSV, PDF).
    * **Notes:** Depends on task status updates.


6. **As a** team member, **I want** to update the status of my tasks, **so that** others are aware of my progress.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows users to change task status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).
        * Status updates are reflected in real-time for all team members.
        * The system records the history of status changes.
        * Users can add comments to status updates.
        * The system allows for the addition of custom statuses by the project manager.
    * **Notes:** Depends on task status and comments functionality.


7. **As a** team member, **I want** to add comments to tasks, **so that** I can collaborate with others and share information.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows users to add comments to tasks.
        * Comments are timestamped and attributed to the user.
        * Users can reply to existing comments.
        * The system supports Markdown formatting in comments.
        * Comments are visible to all users with access to the task.
    * **Notes:** No dependencies.


**III. File Attachments**

8. **As a** team member, **I want** to attach files to tasks, **so that** I can share relevant documents and information.
    * **Priority:** Should Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows users to upload files of various types (e.g., PDF, DOCX, JPG).
        * File uploads are limited in size (e.g., 10MB).
        * Uploaded files are associated with the task.
        * The system displays a list of attached files.
        * The system allows for download of attached files.
    * **Notes:** No dependencies.


**IV. Non-Functional Requirements**

9. **As a** system administrator, **I want** the system to be highly available and performant, **so that** users experience minimal downtime and fast response times.
    * **Priority:** Must Have

        * System uptime is greater than 99.9%.
        * Average response time for API requests is less than 200ms.
        * The system can handle a concurrent load of at least 100 users.
        * System performance is monitored and reported regularly.
        * The system scales horizontally to accommodate increasing user load.
    * **Notes:** Requires robust infrastructure and performance testing.
