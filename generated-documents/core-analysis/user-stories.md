        * The tool handles different types of errors appropriately (e.g., network errors, API rate limits).
        * The tool provides options for handling error conditions (e.g., continue, stop).

7. **As a Project Manager,** I want to be able to choose from multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), so that I can leverage the best model for my needs and budget.
    * **Priority:** Should Have

These user stories provide a comprehensive starting point for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Further refinement and prioritization will be necessary during sprint planning.  The "Notes" section allows for capturing dependencies and constraints that may impact the implementation of individual stories.
