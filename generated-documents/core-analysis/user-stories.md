## Task Management System - User Stories

**I. Task Creation and Assignment**

**A. Task Creator**

1. **As a** project manager, **I want** to create new tasks with a title, description, due date, priority level, and assigned team member, **so that** I can delegate work effectively and track progress.

    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows the creation of a task with a title (max 255 characters).
        * The system allows a description (max 4000 characters).
        * The system allows setting a due date.
        * The system allows assigning a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
        * The system allows assigning the task to one or more team members.
    * **Notes:** Depends on user authentication and team member management.


2. **As a** project manager, **I want** to be able to assign a task to multiple team members simultaneously, **so that** I can efficiently distribute workload across the team.
    * **Priority:** Should Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows selecting multiple users from a list of team members.
        * The assigned users receive a notification.
        * The task shows all assigned users.
        * Assigning a task to multiple users does not create multiple task entries.
        * The assignment functionality handles edge cases like assigning to a non-existent user.
    * **Notes:** Depends on user authentication and notification system.


3. **As a** team member, **I want** to receive a notification when I'm assigned a new task, **so that** I'm aware of my responsibilities.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system sends an email notification upon task assignment.
        * The notification includes task title, due date, and assigned by.
        * The notification includes a link to the task in the application.
        * The notification allows for opting out of email notifications.
        * The system handles notification failures gracefully.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on notification service integration.


**B. Task Assignee**

4. **As a** team member, **I want** to see all tasks assigned to me in a clear and organized list, **so that** I can easily manage my workload.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Tasks assigned to a user are displayed in a dedicated view.
        * Tasks are sorted by due date (default) and filterable by priority and status.
        * Each task displays title, due date, priority and assigned by.
        * The view is paginated for large numbers of tasks.
        * The view is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on task creation functionality.


**II. Progress Tracking**

5. **As a** team member, **I want** to update the status of my assigned tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed), **so that** the team can track progress accurately.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Each task has a status field with predefined options (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed, Blocked).
        * Users can change the task status.
        * Status changes are reflected in all relevant views (e.g., project manager's view).
        * Status changes trigger notifications to relevant stakeholders (if configured).
        * The system prevents invalid status transitions (e.g., going from Completed to In Progress).
    * **Notes:** Depends on task assignment and notification system.


**III. Team Collaboration**

6. **As a** team member, **I want** to add comments to tasks, **so that** I can communicate with other team members about task-related issues.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**

        * Comments include timestamps and user identification.
        * Comments are displayed in chronological order.
        * Comments can be edited or deleted by the author.
        * The system handles edge cases like very long comments.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on user authentication.


**IV. Due Date Management**

        * The system handles invalid due dates (e.g., dates in the past).
        * Editing a due date triggers a notification to assigned users.
    * **Notes:** Depends on task creation and notification systems.
