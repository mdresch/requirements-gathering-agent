## Task Management System - User Stories

**I. Task Creation and Assignment**

**A. Project Manager**

1. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to create new tasks with a title, description, due date, assigned user, and priority level so that I can effectively delegate work and track progress.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows input of a task title (max 255 characters).
        * The system allows input of a task description (supports Markdown formatting).
        * The system allows selection of a due date from a calendar.
        * The system allows assignment of a task to a specific team member from a dropdown list of users.
        * The system allows selection of a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    * **Notes:** Depends on user authentication and user management functionality.

2. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to be able to bulk upload tasks from a CSV file so that I can quickly import existing task lists.
    * **Priority:** Should Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system accepts CSV files with specified columns (title, description, due date, assignee, priority).
        * The system validates the CSV data before import.
        * The system provides feedback on successful or failed imports, including error messages.
        * The system handles different date formats in the CSV file.
        * The system maps CSV column headers to the correct task fields.
    * **Notes:** Requires a well-defined CSV format specification.


**B. Team Member**

3. **Story:** As a team member, I want to see a list of all tasks assigned to me, sorted by due date and priority so that I can prioritize my work effectively.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Tasks are displayed in a clear and concise format.
        * Tasks are sortable by due date (ascending and descending).
        * Tasks are sortable by priority (High, Medium, Low).
        * The list displays the task title, due date, and priority level.
        * The list shows the number of tasks assigned to the user.
    * **Notes:** Depends on task creation and assignment functionality.

4. **Story:** As a team member, I want to be able to mark a task as complete so that my progress is accurately reflected.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * A clear "Mark as Complete" button or checkbox is available for each task.
        * Upon marking complete, the task's status updates and is removed from the active task list.
        * A completed task's status is clearly indicated (e.g., visually different).
        * The system records the completion date and time.
        * The system prevents accidental completion (e.g., confirmation dialog).
    * **Notes:** None.


**II. Progress Tracking**

5. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to see a visual representation (e.g., Kanban board) of the progress of all tasks so that I can easily monitor the overall project status.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * A Kanban board displays tasks grouped by status (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Completed).
        * The board displays the task title and due date.
        * The board allows dragging and dropping tasks between statuses.
        * The board provides a clear indication of the number of tasks in each status.
        * The board is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on task creation, assignment, and completion functionality.


**III. Team Collaboration**

6. **Story:** As a team member, I want to be able to add comments to tasks so that I can communicate with other team members about task-specific issues.
    * **Priority:** Should Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * A comment section is visible on each task detail page.
        * Users can add and view comments.
        * Comments display the author's name and timestamp.
        * Comments support Markdown formatting.
        * Comments are displayed chronologically.
    * **Notes:**  Depends on user authentication and task detail view.


**IV. File Attachments**

7. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to be able to attach files (documents, images) to tasks so that I can provide relevant context and information.
    * **Priority:** Should Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Users can upload files (with size limits).
        * Supported file types are clearly indicated.
        * Uploaded files are associated with the task.
        * File previews (if possible) are displayed.
        * The system handles file storage securely.
    * **Notes:** Requires backend file storage solution (e.g., cloud storage integration).


**V. Non-Functional Requirements**

8. **Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and load quickly so that I can efficiently manage my tasks.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Page load times are under 2 seconds.
        * The application is responsive across different screen sizes and devices.
        * The application is stable and does not crash frequently.
        * The application handles a large number of tasks efficiently.
        * The application performs well under high user load.
    * **Notes:**  Requires performance testing and optimization.


9. **Story:** As a user, I want the system to be secure and protect my data so that my sensitive information is safe.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * User authentication is implemented using JWT.
        * Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
        * Access control is implemented to prevent unauthorized access.
        * Regular security audits are conducted.
        * The system complies with relevant data privacy regulations.
    * **Notes:** Requires expertise in security best practices and relevant regulations.


These user stories provide a solid foundation for the development of the task management system.  Remember that these are examples and should be refined and expanded upon during sprint planning and backlog refinement.
