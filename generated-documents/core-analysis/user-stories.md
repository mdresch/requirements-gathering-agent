## Task Management System - User Stories

**I. Task Creation and Assignment**

**A. Task Creator**

1. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to create a new task with a title, description, due date, priority level, and assigned team member(s), so that I can effectively delegate work and track progress.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows me to input a title (max 255 characters).
        * The system allows me to input a detailed description (supports markdown).
        * The system allows me to select a due date from a calendar.
        * The system allows me to select a priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
        * The system allows me to assign the task to one or more team members from a selectable list.
    * **Notes:** Depends on user authentication and team member management functionality.


2. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to be able to add attachments (documents, images) to a task, so that I can provide relevant context and supporting materials to the assignee.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows me to upload files (limited to a specific size).
        * Uploaded files are associated with the task.
        * Uploaded files are accessible to the task assignee and other authorized users.
        * The system displays file names and sizes.
        * The system supports common file types (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .jpg).
    * **Notes:**  Depends on file storage implementation.


3. **Story:** As a team member, I want to be notified when a task is assigned to me, so that I am aware of my responsibilities.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * A notification is sent to the assigned user via email.
        * A notification is displayed within the application (e.g., a badge or alert).
        * The notification includes the task title and due date.
        * The notification links directly to the task.
        * Users can configure notification preferences.
    * **Notes:** Depends on notification service integration.


**B. Task Assignee**

4. **Story:** As a team member, I want to be able to accept or reject a task assignment, so that I can manage my workload effectively.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system provides options to accept or reject a task assignment.
        * Upon acceptance, the task's status updates accordingly.
        * Upon rejection, the task is unassigned and the assignor is notified.
        * The system records the acceptance/rejection timestamp.
        * Rejection allows for optional comments.
    * **Notes:** Depends on task status management.


**II. Progress Tracking & Collaboration**

5. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to be able to view the progress of each task (e.g., percentage complete), so that I can monitor the overall project health.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Each task displays a progress indicator (e.g., progress bar).
        * Progress is updated automatically based on user input or system calculations.
        * The system allows for manual progress updates by assignees.
        * Progress updates are visible to authorized users.
        * The system provides aggregated project progress view.
    * **Notes:**  Requires a mechanism for progress updates.


6. **Story:** As a team member, I want to be able to add comments to a task, so that I can communicate with other team members about the task's progress and any challenges encountered.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system allows users to add comments to tasks.
        * Comments display timestamps and user names.
        * Comments are visible to all authorized users.
        * The system supports markdown formatting in comments.
        * Comment notifications are sent to relevant users.
    * **Notes:** Depends on user authentication and real-time updates.


**III. Due Date Management & Prioritization**

7. **Story:** As a project manager, I want to be able to set and modify task due dates, so that I can manage project timelines effectively.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Due dates are editable by authorized users.
        * The system provides calendar integration for selecting due dates.
        * Changing a due date triggers relevant notifications.
        * The system visually highlights overdue tasks.
        * The system allows for setting recurring due dates.
    * **Notes:**  N/A


8. **Story:** As a team member, I want to see the priority level of each task, so that I can prioritize my workload accordingly.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Each task displays its priority level (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
        * Priority levels are visually distinguishable (e.g., different colors).
        * The system allows sorting tasks by priority.
        * Priority levels are configurable by the project manager.
        * The system can filter tasks based on priority.
    * **Notes:**  N/A


**IV. Non-Functional Requirements**

9. **Story:** As a user, I want the application to be responsive and performant, so that I can work efficiently.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * Page load times are under 2 seconds.
        * The application is responsive across different devices and screen sizes.
        * The application handles concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
        * The application is stable and error-free.
        * The application meets performance benchmarks defined in the performance testing plan.
    * **Notes:** Requires performance testing and optimization throughout development.


10. **Story:** As an administrator, I want the system to be secure, protecting user data and preventing unauthorized access, so that sensitive information is protected.
    * **Priority:** Must Have
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The system uses industry-standard security practices (e.g., HTTPS, input validation).

        * The system complies with relevant data privacy regulations.
    * **Notes:** Requires security expertise and penetration testing.


These user stories provide a solid foundation for the development of the task management system.  Further refinement and additional stories will be needed as the project progresses.
