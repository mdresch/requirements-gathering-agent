# Project Statement of Work (SOW)

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Sponsor:** [Insert Sponsor Name and Title]

**3. Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name and Title]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Insert Start Date]

**5. Project Completion Date:** [Insert Completion Date]  (Note: This is an estimate and may be adjusted based on project progress.)

**6. Project Objectives:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop and deploy the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a sophisticated AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive and PMBOK-compliant project management documentation.  ADPA will significantly improve project efficiency and reduce manual effort by automating the creation of various project documents, including but not limited to:

*   **Strategic Documents:**  Purpose statements, company values, mission and vision statements.
*   **Technical Design Documents:** Architecture design, system design, database schema, API documentation, security design, performance requirements, integration design, technical stack, deployment architecture, and error handling documentation.
*   **PMBOK 7.0 Compliant Documents:** Project charter, scope management plan, risk management plan, stakeholder register, communication management plan, procurement management plan, resource management plan, quality management plan, cost management plan, work breakdown structure (WBS), WBS dictionary, activity list, activity duration estimates, schedule network diagram, milestone list, and stakeholder engagement plan.


**7. Project Scope:**

ADPA will:

*   **Ingest project context:**  Primarily from a README.md file, but also intelligently discover and analyze ALL relevant project documentation (requirements documents, architecture documentation, stakeholder information, planning documents, technical documentation, and project metadata).  It will score these sources based on relevance (0-100) to PMBOK standards and prioritize them for context generation.
*   **Utilize AI:** Leverage multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to generate high-quality, professional-grade documentation.  The system will automatically optimize for the chosen AI model's capabilities (context window size).
*   **Generate Documents:** Produce a comprehensive suite of documents in a well-organized directory structure.
*   **Validate Documents:**  Perform PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation, including checks for completeness, consistency, and terminology accuracy.  Provide detailed quality scores and actionable recommendations.
*   **Implement Version Control:** Use a built-in version control system (VCS) to track changes to generated documents.  This will include automatic versioning, history viewing, diffing, reverting, and optional remote synchronization.
*   **Provide CLI Interface:** Offer a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction and configuration.
*   **Maintain Modular Architecture:** The system will be designed with a modular, extensible architecture to facilitate future expansion and integration with other tools.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Integration with third-party project management software (though the JSON output will facilitate this).
*   Custom template creation by end-users (pre-built professional templates will be provided).
*   Direct support for non-markdown documentation formats (though the system can intelligently process markdown files discovered within the project).
*   Training or consulting services beyond the provided documentation.


**8. Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional ADPA software application (Node.js package).
*   Comprehensive user documentation (README.md, usage guide, API documentation).
*   Automated testing suite.
*   Deployment guide.


**9. Acceptance Criteria:**

The project will be considered complete when:

*   All specified deliverables are successfully delivered and meet the defined quality standards.
*   The ADPA successfully generates all specified document types with a PMBOK 7.0 compliance score of at least 90% for core documents.
*   The ADPA demonstrates robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
*   The user documentation is clear, comprehensive, and easy to understand.
*   The software undergoes successful user acceptance testing (UAT).


**10. Timeline:**

[Insert detailed project timeline with key milestones and deadlines.  Break down into phases if necessary, such as:  Requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and training.]

**11. Budget:**

[Insert detailed budget breakdown, including costs for development, testing, deployment, and any other relevant expenses.  Specify payment schedule.]

**12. Communication Plan:**

*   Regular project status meetings will be held [frequency].
*   Progress reports will be submitted [frequency].
*   A dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack, email) will be used for project-related communication.
*   Issues and risks will be documented and addressed promptly.

**13. Risk Management:**

[Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.  Examples might include:  AI model limitations, API availability issues, unexpected technical challenges, and scope creep.]

**14. Assumptions:**

[List any assumptions made during the project planning process.  Examples might include:  availability of necessary resources, access to AI APIs, and stakeholder cooperation.]

**15. Approvals:**
