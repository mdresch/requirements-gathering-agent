# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Description:**  
ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business/data analysis. It offers both CLI and REST API interfaces to generate professional documentation aligned with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. The platform enables multi-provider AI integration, enterprise-grade security, regulatory compliance, and seamless integration with tools like Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services.

**WBS Approach:**  
The WBS uses a deliverable-oriented, four-level hierarchical decomposition, ensuring 100% scope coverage. Major deliverables are defined per functional area (framework core, standards implementations, integrations, platform infrastructure, project governance), and further decomposed into manageable, assignable work packages. Each work package is described for clarity and traceability.

## WBS Guidelines

- **Decomposition Principles:**  
  - Deliverable-based decomposition, 3–4 levels deep  
  - Each work package is discrete, assignable, and measurable  
  - All scope is accounted for (100% rule); no overlap or omission

- **Level of Detail Rationale:**  
  - Level 2: Major functional areas and phases for clear ownership  
  - Level 3: Work packages that can be assigned to individuals or small teams  
  - Level 4 (if used): Activities/tasks for tracking and estimating

- **Maintenance Procedures:**  
  - WBS is maintained as a living document, updated with scope changes  
  - All changes reviewed and approved via project governance  
  - WBS codes are not reused to maintain traceability  
  - Work package progress tracked using project management tooling (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.)
