## 1. Executive Summary

The ADPA project (formerly Requirements Gathering Agent) continues to make strong progress as a modular, enterprise-grade automation framework for standards-compliant document generation and project management. Q2 2024 focused on expanding DMBOK 2.0 (Data Management) coverage, enhancing integration capabilities, and delivering key new features for AI-powered document automation. The team remains on track with the published roadmap, and recent releases have strengthened ADPA’s positioning for Fortune 500 and regulated enterprise adoption. No critical blockers at this time.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

- **DMBOK 2.0 Implementation:**  
  All core DMBOK document types (e.g., Data Governance, Data Stewardship, Data Modeling Standards, Business Intelligence Strategy, Enterprise Data Dictionary, Data Architecture & Quality) are implemented and production-ready.
- **Introduction Documents:**  
  Successfully launched “Introduction” document types for both BABOK and DMBOK, providing comprehensive overviews/checklists for stakeholders.
- **Enhanced AI Provider Support:**  
  Integrated and tested Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama, with automated failover and provider prioritization.
- **Confluence & SharePoint Integration:**  
  Production-ready OAuth2 authentication and publishing functionality for both platforms is now live.
- **Admin Web Interface:**  
  Next.js-based admin portal is feature-complete for managing document generation, templates, and integration settings.
- **Checklist-Driven Development:**  
  Expanded use of implementation checklists for all major document types (see checklists for Introduction, Data Modeling Standards, Data Dictionary, BI Strategy, etc.), ensuring robust QA and traceability.
- **Continuous Integration and Test Coverage:**  
  CI pipeline with Jest/TypeScript tests for all major modules; >90% coverage on new code.
- **Updated Documentation:**  
  README, Wiki, and template guides now fully document all available document types and integration workflows.
