Certainly! Below is a **hierarchical Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** for the **ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework** project. The WBS is tailored to the context from the README and supporting files, following best practices for modular, standards-compliant enterprise software. Each Level 1 deliverable is further decomposed into Level 2 and Level 3 work packages, aligned with the technical and business scope.
