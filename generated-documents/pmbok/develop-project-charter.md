# Develop Project Charter

**Project Title:**  
ADPA â€“ Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (formerly Requirements Gathering Agent)

**Project Version:**  
3.2.0

**Project Sponsor:**  
Menno Drescher (Contact: menno.drescher@gmail.com)

**Date:**  
July 2025

## 1. Project Purpose / Justification

The ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework is designed to address the increasing demand for standards-compliant, AI-driven automation of business documentation, requirements management, and project governance in large-scale enterprises. The framework delivers professional document generation and analysis, leveraging leading industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0) and integrating with enterprise platforms such as SharePoint, Confluence, and Adobe Document Services.

### Business Need
- Manual document creation is slow, error-prone, and inconsistent.
- Enterprises require alignment with regulatory and industry standards (e.g., Basel III, GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS).
- There is a need for scalable, secure, and automated solutions that integrate with existing enterprise systems.
- Increasing adoption of AI in business operations necessitates a modular, provider-agnostic platform.

---

## 2. Project Objectives & Success Criteria

### Objectives
- Develop and maintain an extensible, modular framework for automated, standards-compliant business documentation.
- Provide both CLI and REST API interfaces for seamless integration into enterprise workflows.
- Enable multi-provider AI orchestration (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama, Azure OpenAI).
- Deliver cross-framework support for BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 (in progress).
- Integrate with Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, and enterprise SSO/identity management.
- Ensure compliance with major regulatory frameworks and support for Fortune 500-scale deployments.

### Success Criteria
- Production-ready release supporting full BABOK v3 and PMBOK 7th Edition documentation pipelines.
- Demonstrable, standards-compliant document generation via CLI, API, and web admin interface.
- Successful integration with Confluence and SharePoint for automated publishing.
- Enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and audit logging implemented.
- Positive feedback and adoption by pilot Fortune 500 clients/beta partners.

## 3. High-Level Requirements

- **Modular Architecture:**  
  TypeScript/Node.js-based, supporting plugin modules for AI, document templates, and integrations.

- **AI Provider Abstraction:**  
  Pluggable support for OpenAI (GPT-4, GPT-3.5), Google AI (Gemini Pro), GitHub Copilot, Ollama, Azure OpenAI, with automatic failover and selection.

- **Document Generation Engine:**  
  Template-based, supporting markdown, PDF (via Adobe/other), and export to Confluence/SharePoint.

- **REST API & CLI:**  
  Express.js server with TypeSpec-generated OpenAPI specs, robust CLI tools (yargs-based).

- **Compliance & Security:**  
  Enterprise SSO (OAuth2, SAML), RBAC, audit logging, support for GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, HIPAA, etc.

- **Extensibility:**  
  Custom templates, support for additional frameworks and integrations.

- Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe APIs integration
- CLI, REST API, and Web Admin interfaces
- Compliance with key regulatory and industry standards
- Enterprise authentication, auditing, and monitoring

**Out of Scope:**
- Custom AI model development
- Non-standard or legacy document formats
- Maintenance of downstream enterprise systems

### Key Deliverables

## 5. Assumptions, Constraints, and Risks

### Assumptions
- Enterprise users have access to required API credentials (OpenAI, Google, Adobe, Microsoft, etc.).
- Pilot organizations have modern infrastructure (Node.js 18+, modern browsers, access to cloud platforms).
- Stakeholders are available for requirements clarification and testing feedback.

### Constraints
- Adherence to open-source license (MIT) and standards compliance (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
- Implementation timelines aligned with quarterly roadmap.
- Limited to Node.js/TypeScript ecosystem for core components.

### Risks
- AI provider API rate limits, changes, or outages.
- Shifting regulatory requirements.
- Integration challenges with enterprise SSO and document platforms.
- Resource availability for ongoing maintenance and support.
