# Control Scope Process

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the Control Scope process for the ADPA project, ensuring that project work remains aligned with the approved Project Scope Statement and that changes are managed effectively.  This process adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.

**1.  Scope Baseline:**

The project scope baseline consists of the following approved documents:

* **Project Scope Statement:**  [`ProjectScopeStatement.md`](generated-documents/scope-management/project-scope-statement.md) – This document defines the project's objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.  It serves as the primary reference point for scope control.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  [`WBS.md`](generated-documents/planning-artifacts/WBS.md) (Assumed generated document) – The WBS decomposes the project into manageable work packages, providing a detailed breakdown of the scope.
* **WBS Dictionary:** [`WBSDictionary.md`](generated-documents/planning-artifacts/WBSDictionary.md) (Assumed generated document) – This dictionary provides detailed descriptions of each work package in the WBS.

**2.  Monitor Scope:**

* **Regular Monitoring:** The project team will regularly monitor project progress against the scope baseline.  This involves tracking the completion of work packages and comparing actual work performed against the planned work.  This monitoring will leverage ADPA's built-in capabilities to track progress against the WBS.
* **Performance Reporting:**  Regular performance reports will be generated, highlighting any deviations from the planned scope.  These reports will utilize the data generated by ADPA's project analysis and document quality assessment features.  The frequency of these reports will be weekly, with a summary report provided monthly.
* **Variance Analysis:**  Any variances between planned and actual work will be analyzed to identify potential causes (e.g., scope creep, resource constraints).
* **Stakeholder Communication:**  Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders regarding scope performance and any identified variances. This will be facilitated by ADPA’s communication plan and stakeholder engagement plan.

**3.  Control Scope:**

* **Change Management Process:**  A formal change management process will be implemented to manage any requests for changes to the project scope.  This process will involve:
    * **Change Request Submission:**  Stakeholders submit change requests through a defined channel (e.g., a dedicated issue tracker within the project's GitHub repository).
    * **Change Request Evaluation:**  The project manager and relevant stakeholders will evaluate each change request, assessing its impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources. ADPA's risk assessment capabilities will be leveraged to evaluate the potential impact of change requests.
    * **Change Request Approval/Rejection:**  The project manager will approve or reject change requests based on the evaluation.  Approved changes will be formally documented and integrated into the scope baseline.
    * **Scope Baseline Update:** The project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary will be updated to reflect approved changes. This updated baseline will be version-controlled using ADPA’s built-in VCS.
* **Preventative Actions:**  Proactive measures will be taken to prevent scope creep. This includes:
    * **Regular Scope Reviews:**  Conducting regular scope reviews with stakeholders to ensure alignment and address potential issues early.
    * **Clear Communication:**  Maintaining clear and consistent communication with stakeholders regarding project scope.
    * **Comprehensive Requirements Gathering:**  Ensuring that all requirements are thoroughly documented and understood at the beginning of the project.

**4.  Tools and Techniques:**

* **ADPA:** The ADPA tool itself will be the primary tool for monitoring scope, managing changes, and generating reports.  Its built-in project analysis, VCS, and quality assessment features are critical to this process.
* **Project Management Software (Optional):**  A supplementary project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana) may be used to track tasks and manage change requests, integrating with ADPA's output.


**5.  Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:**  Overall responsibility for scope control, change management, and communication.
* **Project Team:**  Responsible for monitoring progress, reporting variances, and implementing approved changes.
* **Stakeholders:**  Responsible for submitting change requests and participating in scope reviews.


**6.  Acceptance Criteria:**

The Control Scope process will be considered successful if:

* Project deliverables are completed within the approved scope.
* All change requests are processed efficiently and effectively.
* Stakeholders are kept informed and engaged throughout the process.
* The project remains on schedule and within budget.


This Control Scope process will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to adapt to changing circumstances and ensure the successful completion of the ADPA project.
