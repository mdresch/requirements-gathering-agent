**Total Estimated Duration:** 43 days

**Note:** This is a high-level activity list. Each activity can be further broken down into smaller, more detailed tasks as needed.  The duration estimates are approximations and should be refined during detailed planning.  Contingency time should be added to account for unforeseen issues.  This list also assumes the availability of necessary infrastructure and resources.
