# WBS Dictionary: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed information for each work package within the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It is organized according to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and adheres to PMBOK guidelines.

**Note:**  Due to the complexity and scope of generating a complete WBS for this project from the provided README, this dictionary provides a sample of key work packages. A full WBS would require significantly more detailed project specifications.  The relevance scores from the provided text are used as a guide for prioritization.

This is a partial WBS Dictionary.  A comprehensive WBS would include significantly more granular work packages for each phase of the project. This example provides a framework for a more complete document.  The estimated durations are also highly dependent on team size, skill set, and other project-specific factors.
