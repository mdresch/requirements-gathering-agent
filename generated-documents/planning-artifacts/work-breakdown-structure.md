# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction:**

This Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) outlines all the tasks required to complete the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It follows the 100% rule, ensuring all work is included. The WBS is hierarchical, using a noun-based naming convention for work packages, and is organized by project phases.  This WBS will be used for planning, scheduling, budgeting, resource allocation, and progress tracking.


**2. Project Phases and Deliverables:**

1. **Project Initiation:**
    1.1 Project Charter Development
    1.2 Stakeholder Identification and Analysis
    1.3 Project Kickoff Meeting
    1.4 Initial Risk Assessment

2. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**
    2.1 Requirements Elicitation (Stakeholder Interviews, Document Review)
    2.2 Requirements Analysis and Documentation
    2.3 Requirements Validation and Prioritization
    2.4 Requirements Management Plan Creation

3. **System Design and Development:**
    3.1 System Architecture Design
    3.2 Context Management System Development
    3.3 AI Provider Integration (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama)
    3.4 Document Generation Engine Development
    3.5 CLI Interface Development
    3.6 Modular Processor Architecture Implementation
    3.7 Version Control System Integration
    3.8 Unit Testing
    3.9 Integration Testing
    3.10 User Documentation Creation

4. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
    4.1 Unit Testing (All Modules)
    4.2 Integration Testing (All Components)
    4.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
    4.4 PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation
    4.5 Security Testing
    4.6 Performance Testing
    4.7 Bug Fixing and Issue Resolution


5. **Deployment and Release:**
    5.1 Deployment Environment Setup
    5.2 Code Deployment
    5.3 Release Documentation Creation
    5.4 Release to NPM Registry
    5.5 Post-Release Monitoring


6. **Project Closure:**
    6.1 Project Documentation Archiving
    6.2 Lessons Learned Documentation
    6.3 Project Team Debriefing
    6.4 Final Report Generation


**3.  Work Package Descriptions (Illustrative Examples):**

Several work packages are further decomposed below to illustrate the level of detail that can be captured within a WBS.  The level of decomposition would be determined during project planning based on the complexity and the team's needs.

* **3.1 System Architecture Design:**
    * 3.1.1 Define System Architecture
    * 3.1.2 Design Database Schema (if applicable)
    * 3.1.3 Design API Interfaces
    * 3.1.4 Create System Diagrams (UML, etc.)

* **3.3 AI Provider Integration (OpenAI):**
    * 3.3.1 OpenAI API Key Configuration
    * 3.3.2 OpenAI Model Selection and Testing
    * 3.3.3 OpenAI API Integration with Core System
    * 3.3.4 Error Handling and Retry Logic for OpenAI


* **5.4 Release to NPM Registry:**
    * 5.4.1 Package Versioning and Tagging
    * 5.4.2 Publishing to NPM
    * 5.4.3 Verification of Successful Publication


This WBS provides a foundational framework.  During the project planning process, further decomposition of work packages may be necessary to achieve a granular level of detail suitable for effective project management.  The level of detail should be sufficient to allow for accurate estimation, scheduling, and resource allocation.
