**4.  Notes**

This WBS provides a high-level overview. Each work package can be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable tasks as needed during detailed project planning.  The level of detail will depend on the project's complexity and the team's preferences.  This WBS will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle.
