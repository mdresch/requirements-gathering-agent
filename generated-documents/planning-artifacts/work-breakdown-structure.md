# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

## Introduction

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project provides a hierarchical decomposition of all work required to successfully deliver the project. Following the PMBOK guidelines, the WBS adheres to the 100% rule, ensuring all deliverables and project management activities are included. The WBS is organized by project phases and major deliverables, with each work package being estimable, manageable, and independent. This document serves as a foundation for planning, scheduling, estimating costs, and managing project scope.
