## Project Milestone List: Requirements Gathering Agent

### Milestone Planning Overview

**Purpose:** This document outlines key project achievements and decision points (milestones) for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Milestones represent significant events with zero duration, marking the completion of a phase or key deliverable.

**Milestone Criteria:** Each milestone will have clearly defined success criteria, target dates, responsible parties, and dependencies.  Formal sign-off will be required for milestones marked with (*).

**Stakeholder Approval (*):** Milestones marked with an asterisk (*) require formal approval from specified stakeholders before proceeding to the next phase.

**Schedule Integration:** Milestones are integrated into the overall project schedule using a Gantt chart (not included here but will be part of the Project Management Plan).  Dependencies between milestones are explicitly noted.


### Project Phase Milestones

**Note:** Target dates will be populated in the final Project Schedule.  This is a placeholder list.

### Milestone Dependencies and Relationships

**Critical Milestone Path:** IM-001 -> PM-001 -> PM-002 -> EM-001 -> EM-002 -> EM-003 -> CL-001 -> CL-002.  Any delay in a milestone on this path will directly impact the overall project completion date.

**Milestone Dependencies:**  Dependencies are explicitly shown in the tables above.  Delays in predecessor milestones will impact the start date of successor milestones.

**Risk Factors:**  Risks associated with each milestone will be identified and mitigated in the Risk Management Plan.


### Milestone Monitoring and Control

**Milestone Performance Metrics:**  Progress against milestones will be tracked using a combination of Gantt charts, status reports, and KPI dashboards.  Metrics will include Milestone Achievement Rate, Milestone Variance, Milestone Quality, and Stakeholder Satisfaction.

**Risk Management for Milestones:**  The Risk Register will identify potential risks for each milestone, along with mitigation strategies and contingency plans.  Early warning indicators will be established to detect potential delays.


### Stakeholder Communication

Regular milestone reports will be provided to stakeholders.  Escalation procedures will be followed if milestones are at risk.  Milestone achievements will be celebrated to maintain team morale.  Lessons learned from each milestone will be documented and used to improve future projects.


This Milestone List provides a high-level overview.  Further details will be provided in the complete Project Management Plan.
