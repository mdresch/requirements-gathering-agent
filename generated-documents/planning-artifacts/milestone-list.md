### Milestone Dependencies and Relationships

A detailed dependency diagram will be created and maintained within the project schedule.  Critical path analysis will identify milestones with the greatest impact on project completion.


### Milestone Monitoring and Control

**Milestone Performance Metrics:**  Progress against milestones will be tracked using the metrics listed below.  Regular reports will be generated and presented to stakeholders.

* **Milestone Achievement Rate:** Percentage of milestones met on or before their target date.
* **Milestone Variance:** Difference between actual and planned milestone completion dates.
* **Milestone Quality:**  Assessment of whether the milestone's success criteria were met.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Feedback from stakeholders on milestone achievements.


**Risk Management for Milestones:**  Risks associated with each milestone will be identified and addressed proactively through mitigation strategies and contingency plans. Early warning indicators will be established to detect potential delays.


### Stakeholder Communication

A communication plan will outline how milestone progress will be reported to stakeholders, including regular updates, escalation procedures, and celebration events. Lessons learned from each milestone will be documented and shared to improve future projects.


This milestone list will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in scope, schedule, or risks.
