## Project Milestone List: Requirements Gathering Agent

### Milestone Planning Overview

**Purpose**: This document outlines key project achievements and decision points (milestones) for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensuring alignment with PMBOK standards and facilitating effective project monitoring and control.  Milestones represent significant events marking progress and requiring specific actions or approvals.

**Milestone Criteria**: Milestones are significant, measurable events with zero duration, representing the completion of a key phase or activity. They trigger specific actions or approvals and serve as checkpoints for progress monitoring.

**Stakeholder Approval**: Milestones marked with an asterisk (*) require formal sign-off from designated stakeholders.

**Schedule Integration**:  These milestones are integrated into the overall project schedule, defining key dates and dependencies.  A Gantt chart (not included here but recommended) would visually represent these relationships.


### Project Phase Milestones

**Note:** Target dates are placeholders and should be replaced with actual project schedule dates.

### Milestone Dependencies and Relationships

**Critical Milestone Path:** IM-01 → PM-01 → PM-02 → EM-01 → EM-02 → EM-03 → CL-01 → CL-02.  Any delay in a milestone on this path will directly impact the project completion date.

**Milestone Dependencies:**  The table above lists dependencies for each milestone.  These should be further elaborated in a project schedule with a clear visual representation (e.g., Gantt chart).

**Risk Factors:**  Risks associated with each milestone should be identified and documented in a Risk Register.  These could include resource availability, technical challenges, stakeholder approvals, and external factors.

**Milestone Integration:**  Milestones are integrated with the project schedule, contract obligations (if applicable), budget releases, and go/no-go decision points.

### Milestone Monitoring and Control

**Milestone Performance Metrics:** The following metrics will be tracked and reported regularly:

* **Milestone Achievement Rate:** Percentage of milestones completed on or before the target date.
* **Milestone Variance:** Difference between actual and planned completion dates.
* **Milestone Quality:** Assessment of whether the success criteria for each milestone were met.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Feedback from stakeholders on milestone completion.

**Risk Management for Milestones:**  A risk management plan will identify potential risks associated with each milestone, define mitigation strategies, and outline contingency plans.

### Stakeholder Communication

* **Milestone Reporting:** Regular progress reports will be provided to stakeholders, highlighting achievements and any potential issues.
* **Escalation Procedures:**  A clear process will be defined for escalating issues that could impact milestone achievement.
* **Celebration Events:**  Milestone achievements will be recognized and celebrated to boost team morale.
* **Lessons Learned:**  After each milestone, a brief review will be conducted to capture lessons learned and identify areas for improvement.


This Milestone List provides a high-level overview. A detailed project schedule with a Gantt chart and risk register should be developed to provide a more comprehensive view of the project timeline and potential risks.
