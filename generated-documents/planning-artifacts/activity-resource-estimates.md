## Activity Resource Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the resource estimates for the activities involved in developing and deploying the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  Estimates are based on a team of 3 developers with varying skill levels (Senior, Mid-level, Junior).  We'll use a combination of effort-based and resource-based estimating techniques.

**Assumptions:**

* **Team Composition:** 1 Senior Developer, 1 Mid-level Developer, 1 Junior Developer
* **Developer Hourly Rates:** Senior - $100/hour, Mid-level - $75/hour, Junior - $50/hour
* **Work Week:** 40 hours
* **Contingency:** 10% added to account for unforeseen issues and delays.

**Activity List and Resource Assignments:**

**Resource Calendar:**

A detailed resource calendar would be created showing the allocation of each developer to various activities over the project duration. This would consider individual developer availability and potential overlapping tasks.

**Cost Estimate:**

* **Senior Developer:** 341 hours * $100/hour = $34,100
* **Mid-level Developer:** 269.5 hours * $75/hour = $20,212.50
* **Junior Developer:** 148.5 hours * $50/hour = $7,425
* **Total Cost:** $61,737.50

**Note:** This is a high-level estimate.  A more detailed breakdown would be required for precise cost and resource allocation.  Factors such as third-party API costs (Azure OpenAI) should also be considered.  This estimate does not include project management overhead.  Agile methodologies would be employed to manage this project, with regular sprint reviews and adjustments to resource allocation as needed.
