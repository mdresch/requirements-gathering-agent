## Activity Resource Estimates: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

### 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive estimate of the resources required for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The estimates are based on a combination of expert judgment, historical data (where available), and project-specific assumptions.  The resource categories include human resources, technology and equipment, facilities and support, and associated costs.  This document will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and project management team.

### 2. Resource Estimation Methodology

This project utilizes a hybrid approach to resource estimation, combining the following techniques:

* **Bottom-Up Estimation:**  Individual activity durations and resource requirements are estimated first, then aggregated to the project level. This provides a detailed level of accuracy.
* **Three-Point Estimation:**  For tasks with inherent uncertainty, a three-point estimate (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) is used to account for potential variations.
* **Expert Judgment:**  The estimates leverage the expertise of the project team members, particularly the lead developers and project manager, based on their experience with similar projects.
* **Analogous Estimating:** We will reference similar projects completed by the team to inform the estimates.

**Historical Data:** While specific historical data for this exact project isn't available, we will use past project data for similar AI-based development projects to inform our estimates.

**Resource Productivity Assumptions:**  We assume a standard 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek, with allowances for meetings, training, and other non-billable activities.  Productivity rates for different roles are detailed in the subsequent sections.

### 3. Human Resource Estimates

The following tables detail the human resource requirements, categorized by role and skill level.  Durations are expressed in weeks.  Total effort is calculated as `Quantity Required * Duration Needed * 40 hours/week`.
