## Schedule Network Diagram for Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the schedule network diagram for the Requirements Gathering Agent project using the Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM).  The diagram represents the project's key activities, their dependencies, and estimated durations.  This allows for critical path analysis, float calculations, and overall schedule risk assessment.

**Note:** Duration estimates are in days and are illustrative.  Actual durations should be determined through detailed task breakdown and expert judgment.

### Network Diagram Overview

**Diagramming Method:** Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)

**Project Phases:** The project is divided into five phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring & Control, and Closure.  These phases are sequential, with some overlap between Monitoring & Control and the other phases.

**Critical Path:** The critical path will be determined after duration estimates are finalized and the network diagram is fully populated (see section below). This path represents the activities whose delays will directly impact the project's overall completion date.

**Schedule Constraints:**  Key constraints include deadlines for release (potentially impacting the execution phase), stakeholder availability for reviews (impacting initiation and planning), and resource availability (impacting all phases).

### Activity Network Structure

**Note:**  This table shows a simplified example.  A real-world project would have many more activities with more complex dependencies.  Leads and lags could also be added to reflect more nuanced relationships.


### Network Diagram Representation

A visual representation (e.g., using MS Project, Primavera P6, or a diagramming tool) would be created based on this data.  The visual diagram would clearly illustrate the network structure, critical path, and float values for each activity.  Due to the limitations of this text-based format, a visual diagram is not included here.


### Network Analysis (Preliminary)

**Critical Path Analysis:**  The critical path will be determined after the durations are finalized and the network is fully developed.  It will be the longest path through the network, determining the shortest possible project duration.

**Float Analysis:** Float (slack) will be calculated for each activity using standard network analysis techniques. This will highlight activities with little or no float, which are at higher risk of delaying the project.

### Schedule Optimization

Schedule compression techniques (crashing and fast-tracking) and resource leveling will be considered to optimize the schedule, taking into account resource constraints and potential costs.  A schedule baseline will be established once the schedule is finalized and approved by stakeholders.  A formal change control process will be in place to manage any schedule modifications.


This schedule network diagram provides a high-level overview. A more detailed schedule, including specific dates, resources, and risk assessments, will be developed and maintained throughout the project lifecycle.  Regular updates to this diagram will be made as the project progresses.
