# Schedule Network Diagram

## Network Diagram Overview
- **Diagramming Method**: Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)  
- **Project Phases**:  
  1. Project Initiation  
  2. Planning  
  3. Execution  
  4. Monitoring & Control  
  5. Closing

   - Predecessors: Activity R  

#### Dependencies:  
- Sequential Finish-to-Start (FS) relationships.

## Network Analysis

### Critical Path Analysis  
- **Critical Path Activities**:  
  - Activity A → Activity B → Activity C → Activity D → Activity F → Activity H → Activity I → Activity J → Activity K → Activity P → Activity Q → Activity R → Activity S  
- **Critical Path Duration**: 43 days  
- **Near-Critical Paths**:  
  - Activities with minimal float, e.g., Activity E and Activity G.  
- **Schedule Risk**: Activities on the critical path are most likely to delay the project.

---

### Float Analysis  
- **Total Float**: Maximum delay allowed without affecting the project end date.  
- **Free Float**: Delay allowed without affecting successor activities.  
- **Project Float**: Buffer time available for the entire project schedule.  
- **Resource Conflicts**: Activities requiring the same resources overlapping in time.

## Network Diagram Representation

### ASCII Network Diagram  
```
[Start] -> [Activity A] -> [Activity B] -> [Activity C] -> [Activity D] -> [Activity F] -> [Activity H] -> [Activity I] -> [Activity J] -> [Activity K] -> [Activity P] -> [Activity Q] -> [Activity R] -> [Activity S] -> [End]
                    |              |              ^
                [Activity E] -> [Activity G] -> [Activity N]
```

### Detailed Activity Boxes  
Each activity is represented with the following details:  
- **Activity ID and Name**  
- **Duration Estimate**  
- **Early Start/Early Finish Dates**  
- **Late Start/Late Finish Dates**  
- **Total Float Value**  

Example:  
```
+----------------------+
| Activity ID: A       |
| Name: Develop Charter |
| Duration: 3 days      |
| Early Start: Day 1    |
| Early Finish: Day 3   |
| Late Start: Day 1     |
| Late Finish: Day 3    |
| Float: 0 days         |
+----------------------+
```

## Schedule Optimization

### Schedule Compression  
- **Fast Tracking**: Activities such as testing and integration can overlap to reduce duration.  
- **Crashing**: Additional resources can be allocated to development and testing to shorten durations.

### Resource Leveling  
- Adjust resources where conflicts exist (e.g., architecture design and resource planning).  

### Schedule Baseline  
- Establish the approved project schedule for performance measurement.  

### Change Control  
- Implement a formal process for schedule modifications, ensuring stakeholder approval for changes.
