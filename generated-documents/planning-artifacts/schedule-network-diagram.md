## Schedule Network Diagram for Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the project schedule using the Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM).  Durations are estimates and should be refined during detailed planning.  This diagram focuses on key activities and dependencies; a more granular schedule will be developed in subsequent phases.

### Network Diagram Overview

**Diagramming Method:** Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)

**Project Phases:**  The project is divided into five phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring & Control, and Closure.

**Critical Path:**  The critical path will be determined after duration estimates are finalized and the network is fully developed.  This will be updated in a subsequent iteration of this document.

**Schedule Constraints:**  Key constraints include the availability of the development team, Azure OpenAI API access, and the need to release a prerelease version to npm for testing and feedback.


### Activity Network Structure

The following table details the activities, their dependencies, and estimated durations.  Dependencies are represented using the four standard relationships: Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Start (SS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), and Start-to-Finish (SF). Leads and lags will be added as the schedule is further refined.

| Activity ID | Activity Description                               | Duration (Days) | Predecessors | Successors | Dependency Type |

**Note:**  This is a simplified representation.  Additional activities and dependencies will be added during detailed scheduling.  For instance, activities like "Develop Context Management System" and "Develop Document Templates" would be broken down further.


### Network Analysis

**Critical Path Analysis:**  The critical path will be identified after assigning detailed durations and performing a forward and backward pass.

**Float Analysis:** Float analysis will be conducted to identify the slack in the schedule and potential areas for resource optimization.


### Network Diagram Representation

Due to the complexity of the project, a visual representation (e.g., using MS Project or a similar tool) would be more suitable than an ASCII diagram.  However, the table above provides a clear representation of the activity network structure.  A Gantt chart will also be generated to visualize the schedule.


### Schedule Optimization

Schedule compression techniques (fast-tracking and crashing) and resource leveling will be considered to optimize the schedule.  A baseline schedule will be established and managed through a formal change control process.


This Schedule Network Diagram provides a high-level overview.  Further refinement will be conducted as more detailed information becomes available.  Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.
