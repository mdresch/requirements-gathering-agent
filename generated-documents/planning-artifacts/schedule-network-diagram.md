This Mermaid diagram represents a simplified Schedule Network Diagram for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It highlights the key stages:

* **Requirement Gathering:** This initial phase focuses on understanding the project's needs.
* **Planning:** This involves defining the scope, creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), estimating activity durations, developing the network diagram itself (sequencing activities and determining dependencies), and creating the final project schedule.  These steps are highly iterative and may involve feedback loops.
* **Approval & Finalization:**  The schedule is reviewed, approved, and finalized.

The diagram uses a simplified representation. A true PMBOK-compliant schedule network diagram for a real-world project would be far more detailed, including specific tasks, durations, dependencies (represented by arrows showing precedence relationships), and potentially critical path highlighting.  The complexity would depend on the project's size and intricacy.  This example focuses on the high-level phases.  The `highlight` class is used to visually emphasize the creation of the network diagram and the final schedule.
