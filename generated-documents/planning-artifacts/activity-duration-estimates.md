## Activity Duration Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

### 1. Overview

This document provides activity duration estimates for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The estimates are based on a combination of expert judgment, analogous estimation (drawing from similar past projects), and three-point estimation (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) to account for inherent uncertainties.  The primary goal is to create a realistic project schedule that balances accuracy with the inherent uncertainties involved in software development and AI integration.

**Estimation Methodology:**  Three-point estimation (PERT) will be used to calculate the expected duration for each activity. This method considers optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic durations to provide a more robust estimate.  Expert judgment from the development team will inform these estimates. Analogous estimation will leverage data from previous AI-integration projects.

**Assumptions and Constraints:**  The estimates assume a dedicated development team with appropriate skills and experience.  External factors, such as API availability and unforeseen technical challenges, are considered in the risk assessment section.  Constraints include the availability of Azure OpenAI resources and the complexity of integrating multiple AI providers.

**Review and Approval Process:**  These estimates will be reviewed by the project manager and key stakeholders before finalization and integration into the project schedule.


### 2. Estimation Methodology

**Techniques Used:**

* **Three-Point Estimation (PERT):**  Used for most activities to account for uncertainty.  The expected duration is calculated as (Optimistic + 4*Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6.
* **Expert Judgment:**  Used to refine estimates and assess qualitative factors.
* **Analogous Estimation:**  Used to benchmark against similar projects.

**Historical Data Sources:**  Data from previous AI integration projects within the organization will be used as a benchmark for analogous estimation.

**Resource Productivity Factors:**  Resource productivity will be based on historical data and team member skill assessments.  Factors such as team size, experience, and complexity will be considered.

**Quality and Complexity Considerations:**  The complexity of AI integration and the need for robust error handling are factored into the estimates.  Thorough testing and quality assurance activities are included.
