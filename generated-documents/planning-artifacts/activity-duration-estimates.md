# Activity Duration Estimates  

## Overview  
### Purpose and Scope of Duration Estimation  
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed estimation of activity durations for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This ensures accurate scheduling, resource allocation, and risk management in alignment with PMBOK standards.  

### Estimation Methodology and Approach  
Activity durations were estimated using a combination of expert judgment, historical data from similar projects, and three-point estimation (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic). The estimates were validated through peer reviews and cross-referenced with benchmarks from previous projects.  

### Assumptions and Constraints  
- Team members have the required skills and experience.  
- No major interruptions in resource availability.  
- AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot) perform as expected.  
- Dependencies between tasks are clearly defined and managed.  
- Environmental factors, such as server infrastructure, are stable.  

### Review and Approval Process  
- Estimates were reviewed by the project manager, technical lead, and subject matter experts.  
- Final approval will be provided by the project sponsor during the planning phase review.

## Estimation Methodology  
### Techniques Used  
- **Expert Judgment**: Inputs from experienced developers, testers, and project managers.  
- **Analogous Estimation**: Benchmarks from similar AI-driven TypeScript projects.  
- **Parametric Estimation**: Calculations based on resource productivity and effort rates.  
- **Three-Point Estimation**: PERT formula applied to calculate expected durations.  

### Historical Data Sources and Benchmarks  
- Previous Node.js projects with AI integration.  
- Industry benchmarks for PMBOK-compliant documentation generation.  

### Resource Productivity Factors  
- Assumed productivity rate: 8 hours/day per full-time resource.  
- Adjustments made for junior vs. senior team members.  

### Quality and Complexity Considerations  
- High-quality standards applied for PMBOK compliance.  
- Complexity factors related to AI provider integration and multi-provider support.
