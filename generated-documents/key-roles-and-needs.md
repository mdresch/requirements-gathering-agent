# Key Roles and Needs Analysis

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the key roles involved in the ADPA project and their associated needs.  It's based on the provided project context, emphasizing the unique aspects of an AI-powered, self-authorizing project.

## I. Key Roles

The ADPA project, due to its unique nature, requires a slightly different approach to role definition than traditional projects.  While some roles are implicitly handled by the AI itself, human oversight and direction remain crucial.

**A. Project Oversight & Governance:**

* **Executive Sponsor:**  Provides high-level strategic direction, secures necessary resources, and approves major decisions.  Needs:  Clear understanding of AI capabilities and limitations, ability to assess the strategic implications of the project, commitment to resource allocation.

* **Project Manager (Human):**  While ADPA manages much of its own execution, a human Project Manager is needed for overall governance, risk mitigation (beyond what the AI identifies), and communication with external stakeholders. Needs:  Strong understanding of project management methodologies (PMBOK), experience with AI-driven projects, excellent communication skills, ability to manage unforeseen challenges.

* **Technical Lead:** Oversees the technical aspects of ADPA's development, maintenance, and integration.  Needs:  Deep expertise in TypeScript, Node.js, Azure OpenAI APIs, and large language model interaction, experience with DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.

**B.  AI System Development & Maintenance:**

* **AI/ML Engineer:** Responsible for the ongoing development, refinement, and maintenance of ADPA's AI models and algorithms.  Needs:  Expertise in machine learning, natural language processing, and prompt engineering, experience with fine-tuning large language models, familiarity with Azure OpenAI services.

* **Data Scientist (Optional):** May be required for advanced data analysis, model training, and performance optimization. Needs:  Expertise in statistical modeling, data analysis, and model evaluation, experience with large datasets, understanding of AI bias mitigation techniques.

**C. User Support & Feedback:**

* **Technical Writer:** Creates clear and comprehensive documentation for ADPA users. Needs:  Strong technical writing skills, experience with API documentation, ability to explain complex concepts simply.

* **Community Manager (Optional):**  Facilitates user engagement, feedback collection, and community building around ADPA. Needs:  Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, experience with online communities, ability to manage user feedback effectively.


## II. Needs Assessment

The needs of each role are interconnected and influence the overall project success.  Key needs across all roles include:

* **Access to Resources:**  Sufficient computational resources (cloud credits, hardware), access to relevant data and documentation, and appropriate software licenses.

* **Training and Development:**  Ongoing training on AI technologies, best practices in project management, and effective communication strategies.

* **Collaboration and Communication:**  Effective communication channels and collaboration tools to facilitate seamless teamwork and knowledge sharing.  This is particularly important because of the unusual nature of an AI-driven project.

* **Risk Management:**  Clear processes for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks related to both the AI system and the project as a whole.

* **Compliance and Governance:**  Adherence to PMBOK standards, security protocols, and ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment.

* **Data Governance:**  Clear strategies for data security, privacy, and compliance with relevant regulations.

* **Monitoring and Evaluation:**  Robust mechanisms for tracking project progress, evaluating performance, and making necessary adjustments.

This Key Roles and Needs Analysis provides a foundation for effective project planning, resource allocation, and team management.  The unique aspects of ADPA, particularly its AI-driven self-initiation, require a proactive and adaptable approach to addressing these needs.  Regular review and updates to this document will be essential as the project evolves.
