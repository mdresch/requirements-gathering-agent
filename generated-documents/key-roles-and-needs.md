* **Needs:**  Detailed project plans (WBS, schedules, budgets), risk registers, communication plans, comprehensive status reports, and tools for monitoring progress and managing resources.  Access to all relevant documentation, including stakeholder information and requirements.  Support from technical team members and stakeholders.

**1.3. Technical Lead/Developer:**

* **Responsibilities:** Designs and implements the ADPA system's architecture, manages the development team, ensures code quality, and integrates with AI providers.
* **Needs:**  Clear technical specifications, detailed architecture diagrams, access to AI provider APIs and documentation, sufficient development resources, testing environments, version control systems, and support from the project manager for task prioritization and resource allocation.  Clear definition of success metrics and acceptance criteria.

**1.4. AI/ML Specialist:**

* **Responsibilities:** Designs and implements AI models and prompts, optimizes model performance, and ensures accurate and relevant output.
* **Needs:**  Access to relevant datasets, sufficient computational resources, appropriate AI development tools, clear specifications for AI models and prompts, and performance metrics to measure model accuracy and efficiency.  Collaboration with technical leads to ensure seamless integration.

**1.5. Business Analyst:**

* **Responsibilities:**  Elicits and analyzes stakeholder requirements, defines user stories, develops use cases, and ensures the system meets business needs.
* **Needs:**  Access to stakeholders, clear communication channels, methods for gathering requirements, tools for documenting and analyzing requirements,  collaboration with the development team to ensure requirements are accurately implemented.  Understanding of PMBOK standards.


**1.6. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:**

* **Responsibilities:** Tests the ADPA system to identify defects, ensures the system meets quality standards, and provides feedback to the development team.
* **Needs:**  Test plans, test cases, testing environments, defect tracking systems, and clear acceptance criteria. Collaboration with developers and project managers.  Access to all generated documentation for validation and testing.

**1.7. End-Users (Project Managers, Business Analysts):**

* **Responsibilities:** Use the ADPA system to generate project documentation.
* **Needs:**  User-friendly interface (CLI), clear instructions, comprehensive documentation, adequate training, technical support, and a system that produces accurate and relevant documents efficiently.


## 2. Needs Analysis

The overall needs of the ADPA project can be summarized as follows:

* **Functional Needs:** Generation of PMBOK-compliant documentation, integration with multiple AI providers, user-friendly CLI interface, robust error handling, modular architecture, and version control.
* **Non-Functional Needs:** High performance, scalability, security, reliability, maintainability, and ease of use.
* **Technical Needs:**  Access to AI APIs, sufficient computational resources, development tools, and testing frameworks.
* **Business Needs:**  Improved efficiency in project documentation creation, reduced costs, enhanced compliance, better stakeholder alignment, and increased project success rates.
* **Stakeholder Needs:**  Timely and accurate information, clear communication, and a system that meets their specific requirements.


## 3.  Addressing Needs

The ADPA project addresses these needs through a combination of:

* **AI-powered automation:** Reduces manual effort and improves efficiency.
* **PMBOK compliance:** Ensures standardized and consistent documentation.
* **Modular architecture:** Allows for future expansion and customization.
* **Comprehensive documentation:** Provides clear instructions and support for users.
* **Multiple AI provider support:**  Offers flexibility and redundancy.
* **Robust testing and validation:** Ensures high-quality output.


This Key Roles and Needs Analysis provides a framework for effective project management, resource allocation, and stakeholder communication throughout the ADPA project lifecycle.  Regular review and updates to this document will ensure it remains relevant and aligned with project progress.
