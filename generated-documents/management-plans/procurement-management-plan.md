# Procurement Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the procurement management plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The plan details the processes for acquiring goods and services needed to successfully complete the project, ensuring compliance with all relevant legislation and supporting our international footprint.  Given the project's reliance on various AI APIs (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), a key focus will be on securing access and managing contracts with these providers.

**2. Procurement Planning**

* **2.1 Procurement Strategy:**  A hybrid approach will be used, combining direct contracts with established AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI) and potentially leveraging cloud marketplaces for other services (e.g., Azure services). This strategy balances cost-effectiveness with the need for robust service level agreements (SLAs) and support from major vendors.

* **2.2 Make-or-Buy Decisions:**  The core AI model interaction logic will be developed in-house.  However, the AI APIs themselves will be procured from external vendors.  Third-party libraries and tools listed in the project metadata will be evaluated for open-source availability and licensing before procurement.

* **2.3 Procurement Documents:** The following documents will be used:
    * **Request for Proposal (RFP):** For significant procurements, such as long-term API access agreements.  RFPs will detail requirements, evaluation criteria, and timelines.
    * **Purchase Orders (POs):** For standard purchases of software licenses or cloud services.
    * **Contracts:** Formal agreements with vendors, outlining responsibilities, SLAs, payment terms, and intellectual property rights.

* **2.4 Source Selection Criteria:** Vendor selection will be based on:
    * **Technical Capabilities:** API performance, reliability, and features.
    * **Cost:** Pricing models and overall cost-effectiveness.
    * **Security:** Data privacy and security certifications and practices.
    * **Support:** Vendor responsiveness and support mechanisms.
    * **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).

* **2.5 Contract Management:** A centralized repository will track all contracts, ensuring timely renewals and adherence to contractual obligations.  Regular reviews will assess vendor performance and identify potential risks.

**3. Procurement Process**

The procurement process will follow these steps:

1. **Needs Identification:**  Identify required goods and services based on the project requirements document.
2. **Vendor Selection:**  Identify potential vendors and evaluate them using the source selection criteria.
3. **Negotiation:**  Negotiate contracts with selected vendors, ensuring favorable terms and conditions.
4. **Contract Award:**  Issue purchase orders or formal contracts to the selected vendor(s).
5. **Contract Administration:**  Monitor vendor performance, address any issues, and ensure compliance with the contract terms.
6. **Payment:**  Process payments to vendors according to the agreed-upon terms.
7. **Contract Closure:**  Formally close the contract upon completion of the procurement.

**4. Risk Management**

* **Vendor Risk:** Potential risks include vendor bankruptcy, service disruptions, or non-compliance. Mitigation strategies include diversifying vendors, incorporating robust SLAs, and implementing contingency plans.
* **Cost Overruns:**  Risks of exceeding the allocated budget will be mitigated through thorough cost estimation, price negotiations, and regular budget monitoring.
* **Contract Disputes:**  Clear contract language and proactive communication will minimize the likelihood of disputes.  A dispute resolution process will be defined in each contract.

**5. Procurement Budget**

A dedicated budget will be allocated for procurement activities. This budget will be regularly monitored and updated as needed.  The budget will encompass API access fees, software licenses, cloud service costs, and contract administration expenses.  Detailed cost breakdowns will be maintained.

**6. Procurement Team**

A designated procurement team will be responsible for managing the procurement process. The team will consist of members with relevant expertise in contract negotiation, vendor management, and legal compliance.

**7.  Compliance Considerations**

All procurement activities will comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA), and any specific banking industry regulations applicable to the project.

**8.  Reporting**

Regular reports will be generated to track procurement progress, costs, and risks. These reports will be shared with relevant stakeholders.

* Templates for RFPs, POs, and contracts.
* Budget allocation details.


This Procurement Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in requirements or circumstances.
