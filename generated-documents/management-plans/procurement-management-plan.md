# Procurement Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose  
The purpose of this Procurement Management Plan is to define the processes, roles, and responsibilities for procuring goods and services required for the successful delivery of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan ensures that all procurement activities are conducted efficiently, transparently, and in alignment with PMBOK standards, project goals, and organizational policies.

## 2. Procurement Authority and Roles  

### 2.1 Procurement Authority  
The **Project Manager (PM)** holds primary authority over procurement activities, including initiating procurement requests, approving procurement plans, and ensuring alignment with project objectives. The **Procurement Officer** and **Legal Advisor** will support the PM in vendor selection, contract negotiation, and compliance reviews.  

### 2.2 Roles and Responsibilities  
| Role                | Responsibilities                                                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Approve procurement strategy, oversee vendor selection, and manage procurement risks. |
| **Procurement Officer** | Develop procurement documents, conduct vendor evaluations, and manage contracts. |
| **Legal Advisor**   | Ensure contract compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.                 |
| **Technical Lead**  | Provide technical input for vendor selection and ensure technical alignment.       |
| **Stakeholders**    | Participate in vendor evaluation and provide input on procurement needs.           |

---

## 3. Make-or-Buy Decision Process  
The **Make-or-Buy Analysis** will assess whether project deliverables should be produced internally or outsourced to external vendors. The process will involve:  
1. **Cost Analysis**: Comparing in-house development costs with vendor pricing.  
2. **Capability Assessment**: Evaluating internal resources' ability to meet project requirements.  
3. **Schedule Impact**: Considering time constraints for internal development versus outsourcing.  
4. **Risk Analysis**: Identifying risks associated with vendor dependency versus internal challenges.  

### Conclusion  
For this project:  
- **Make**: Core development of the Requirements Gathering Agent (TypeScript-based CLI tool).  
- **Buy**: AI services (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI), cloud infrastructure (e.g., Azure hosting), and third-party testing tools.  

---

## 4. Contract Types to Be Used  
The following contract types will be utilized based on procurement needs:  
- **Fixed-Price Contracts**: For well-defined deliverables such as AI services and cloud hosting subscriptions.  
- **Time and Materials Contracts**: For consulting services related to AI provider integration and testing.  
- **Cost-Reimbursable Contracts**: For research and development tasks where costs may vary.  
- **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**: To ensure performance and availability of AI services and cloud resources.  

---

## 5. Procurement Requirements and Constraints  

### 5.1 Requirements  
- Secure AI services from reputable providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI).  
- Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards and regulatory requirements.  
- Acquire tools that support TypeScript development and CLI interfaces.  
- Procure cloud infrastructure with robust security and scalability.  

### 5.2 Constraints  
- Budget limits for AI provider subscriptions and services.  
- Time constraints to finalize vendors before project execution begins.  
- Compliance requirements for data privacy and security (e.g., GDPR).  
- Vendor availability and compatibility with project needs.  

---

## 6. Independent Cost Estimates Approach  
Independent Cost Estimates (ICE) will be conducted for major procurements to ensure fair pricing and budget accuracy.  
- **Methodology**: Benchmarking costs against industry standards and historical data.  
- **Responsibility**: The Procurement Officer will prepare ICEs for all procurements exceeding $10,000.

## 7. Procurement Evaluation Criteria  
All vendors will be evaluated based on the following weighted criteria:  
| Criterion             | Weight (%) | Description                                                                           |
|-----------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Cost**              | 30%        | Competitive pricing within budget constraints.                                        |
| **Technical Capability** | 25%        | Ability to provide required services (e.g., AI model support, cloud scalability).     |
| **Compliance**        | 15%        | Adherence to regulatory and PMBOK standards.                                          |
| **Quality**           | 15%        | Track record of delivering high-quality solutions.                                    |
| **Vendor Reputation** | 10%        | Proven experience and positive reviews from other clients.                           |
| **Support Services**  | 5%         | Availability of ongoing support and maintenance.                                      |

---

## 8. Procurement Documents to Be Used  
The following procurement documents will be developed and utilized:  
- **Request for Proposal (RFP)**: For selecting AI providers and cloud infrastructure vendors.  
- **Request for Quotation (RFQ)**: For smaller procurements such as testing tools.  
- **Statement of Work (SOW)**: To define deliverables and vendor responsibilities.  
- **Purchase Orders (PO)**: For fixed-price contracts.  
- **Contract Agreements**: For all vendor engagements.

## 9. Risk Management Approach for Procurements  
Procurement risks will be identified, assessed, and mitigated through:  
1. **Risk Register**: Documenting procurement risks and mitigation strategies.  
2. **Vendor Risk Assessment**: Evaluating vendor reliability and financial stability.  
3. **Contingencies**: Allocating budget for unforeseen procurement delays or cost overruns.  

---

## 10. Procurement Performance Metrics  
The following metrics will be monitored to ensure procurement success:  
- **Cost Variance**: Actual costs versus budgeted costs.  
- **Schedule Variance**: Adherence to procurement timelines.  
- **Vendor Performance**: Delivery quality, timeliness, and adherence to contract terms.  
- **Compliance Score**: Percentage of deliverables aligned with PMBOK standards.

## 11. Vendor Management Approach  
Vendor relationships will be managed through:  
- **Regular Communication**: Weekly check-ins to track progress and resolve issues.  
- **Performance Reviews**: Monthly evaluations of vendor deliverables.  
- **Escalation Process**: Defined processes for resolving disputes or performance issues.  
- **Termination Clauses**: Clear contract terms for ending engagements if necessary.
