# Procurement Management Plan: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the procurement management plan for Project Backup Vermigerous.  The project aims to automate the monthly backup process, ensuring sufficient and readily restorable backups in case of system failure.  The plan focuses on acquiring necessary software, hardware, and services to achieve secure, reliable, and efficient backups categorized by year and month.

**2. Procurement Strategy**

The procurement strategy will be based on a combination of Make-or-Buy decisions.  We will leverage existing cloud infrastructure where possible (Azure) to minimize procurement costs and maximize security.

* **Make:**  Internal development of scripts (PowerShell, cron jobs) for automation, checksum validation, and metadata tagging.  Internal development of monitoring and alerting systems using existing Azure monitoring tools.
* **Buy:**  Cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy), potentially a third-party backup software solution if deemed necessary after a thorough cost-benefit analysis.


**3. Procurement Process**

The procurement process will follow these steps:

1. **Needs Assessment:**  This has already been completed, identifying the need for automated backup scheduling, incremental/differential backups, data validation, secure storage, metadata tagging, automated recovery testing, and monitoring/alerting.
2. **Market Research:**  Research available cloud storage solutions (Azure Blob Storage will be prioritized), and third-party backup software (if needed).  This research will include cost comparison, feature analysis, security features, and vendor reputation.
3. **Vendor Selection:**  Based on the market research, a shortlist of vendors will be created.  A Request for Information (RFI) or Request for Proposal (RFP) may be issued, depending on the complexity of the requirements.  Evaluation criteria will include price, features, security, and vendor support.
4. **Contract Negotiation:**  Negotiate contracts with selected vendors, ensuring favorable terms and conditions, including service level agreements (SLAs) and support options.
5. **Purchase Order Issuance:**  Issue purchase orders to vendors for approved goods and services.
6. **Delivery and Acceptance:**  Verify the delivery of goods and services and conduct acceptance testing to ensure they meet the specified requirements.
7. **Payment:**  Process payments to vendors according to the terms of the contract.

**4. Procurement Management Team**

* **Procurement Manager:** [Insert Name/Role] – Responsible for overall procurement strategy and execution.
* **Technical Lead:** [Insert Name/Role] – Responsible for evaluating technical aspects of proposed solutions.
* **Security Officer:** [Insert Name/Role] – Responsible for reviewing security aspects of proposed solutions and vendors.

**5. Budget**

A detailed budget will be developed based on the market research and vendor selection.  The budget will include costs for:

* Cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage)
* Third-party software (if applicable)
* Consulting services (if applicable)
* Internal development time


**6. Risk Management**

Potential risks associated with procurement include:

* **Vendor delays:**  Mitigation:  Select vendors with proven track records and include penalties for late delivery in contracts.
* **Cost overruns:** Mitigation:  Develop a detailed budget and closely monitor expenditures.
* **Security vulnerabilities:** Mitigation:  Thoroughly vet vendors and solutions for security compliance, and implement security best practices.
* **Integration challenges:** Mitigation:  Allocate sufficient time for integration testing and troubleshooting.


**7. Procurement Documentation**

All procurement-related documentation will be maintained in a centralized repository, including:

* Needs assessment document
* Market research reports
* Vendor proposals
* Contracts
* Purchase orders
* Acceptance test reports
* Payment records


**8. Communication Plan**

Regular communication will be maintained with stakeholders throughout the procurement process, using email, meetings, and project management tools.

**9.  Procurement Schedule**

A detailed procurement schedule will be developed and maintained, outlining key milestones and deadlines.


**10.  Contract Management**

Contracts will be carefully reviewed and managed to ensure compliance with terms and conditions.  Regular performance monitoring will be conducted to ensure vendors meet their obligations.

This Procurement Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.
