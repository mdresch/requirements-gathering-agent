# Scope Baseline Document  

## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction  

The Scope Baseline document establishes the foundation for defining, managing, and controlling the scope of the **Requirements Gathering Agent project**. It includes the approved **Project Scope Statement**, **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, and **WBS Dictionary**, and describes how the scope baseline will be used for performance measurement and maintenance throughout the project lifecycle. This document aligns with PMBOK standards and serves as the basis for scope control, ensuring the project delivers the intended outcomes within the defined boundaries.

## 2. Scope Baseline Components  

### 2.1 Approved Project Scope Statement  

The **Project Scope Statement** provides a detailed description of the project deliverables, boundaries, constraints, and acceptance criteria. Below is a summary of the approved scope statement:  

#### **Project Objectives**  
- Automate the generation of PMBOK-aligned project management documentation.  
- Improve documentation accuracy, consistency, and compliance with PMBOK standards.  
- Enable seamless integration with Azure AI and other AI providers for advanced functionality.  
- Provide a modular, scalable architecture to support future enhancements.  

#### **Deliverables**  
1. **Core PMBOK Documents**:  
   - Project Charter  
   - Stakeholder Register  
   - Scope Management Plan  
   - Requirements Management Plan  
   - Risk Management Plan  
   - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary  
2. **CLI Tool**: Node.js/TypeScript CLI for document generation and system configuration.  
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides, tutorials, and onboarding materials.  
4. **Validation Features**: PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and quality assessment tools.  

#### **In-Scope Items**  
- PMBOK-aligned document generation for initiating and planning process groups.  
- AI-powered context management for intelligent document generation.  
- Integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and other AI providers.  
- Output in validated JSON format for interoperability.  

#### **Out-of-Scope Items**  
- Custom integrations with third-party project management tools (future phase).  
- Real-time collaboration features (future phase).  

#### **Constraints**  
- Compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards.  
- Limited to Node.js runtime environment.  
- Budget constraints of $250,000 for initial development.  

#### **Acceptance Criteria**  
- Generated documents must pass PMBOK compliance validation with a score of 90% or higher.  
- CLI tool must execute all core functionalities without errors.  
- Documentation must be complete, clear, and aligned with industry standards.

### 2.2 Approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  

The **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** provides a hierarchical decomposition of the project deliverables. Below is the approved WBS for the Requirements Gathering Agent project:  

#### **Level 1**: Requirements Gathering Agent Project  
1. **Project Initiation**  
   - 1.1 Project Charter  
   - 1.2 Stakeholder Register  

2. **Project Planning**  
   - 2.1 Scope Management Plan  
   - 2.2 Requirements Management Plan  
   - 2.3 Risk Management Plan  
   - 2.4 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary  

3. **System Development**  
   - 3.1 CLI Development  
   - 3.2 AI Integration (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot)  
   - 3.3 Context Management System  

4. **Documentation**  
   - 4.1 User Guide and Tutorials  
   - 4.2 Technical Documentation  

5. **Validation and Testing**  
   - 5.1 PMBOK Compliance Validation  
   - 5.2 Quality Assurance Testing  

---

### 2.3 Approved WBS Dictionary  

The **WBS Dictionary** provides detailed descriptions for each WBS element, including work package definitions, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and dependencies. Key entries include:  

#### **Work Package: 2.1 Scope Management Plan**  
- **Description**: Develop the Scope Management Plan to define the scope and control mechanisms for the project.  
- **Deliverables**: Scope Management Plan document.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Must align with PMBOK standards and clearly define scope control processes.  
- **Dependencies**: Requires inputs from the Project Charter and Stakeholder Register.  

#### **Work Package: 3.1 CLI Development**  
- **Description**: Develop the CLI tool for document generation and configuration management.  
- **Deliverables**: Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: CLI must support all core functionalities (e.g., document generation, validation).  
- **Dependencies**: Requires integration with the AI context management system.

## 3. Scope Baseline Usage  

### 3.1 Performance Measurement  

The scope baseline will be used as the primary reference point for measuring project performance. Key metrics include:  
- **Scope Variance**: Comparison of actual deliverables to the approved scope baseline.  
- **Schedule Adherence**: Alignment of deliverables with the milestones defined in the WBS.  
- **Quality Metrics**: Compliance with PMBOK standards and acceptance criteria.  

Regular scope reviews will be conducted during project status meetings to identify and address scope variances, ensuring the project remains aligned with its objectives.  

---

### 3.2 Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates  

The scope baseline will be maintained through formal change control processes. Any changes to the project scope must be approved by the **Change Control Board (CCB)** and documented in the Scope Management Plan. The process includes:  
1. **Change Request Submission**: Stakeholders submit a formal change request outlining the proposed scope modification.  
2. **Impact Analysis**: The project team evaluates the impact of the change on the schedule, budget, and quality.  
3. **Approval/Denial**: The CCB reviews the change request and approves or denies it.  
4. **Baseline Update**: Approved changes are incorporated into the scope baseline, and all affected project documents are updated accordingly.  

---

## 4. Relationship to Other Project Baselines  

The scope baseline is closely tied to other project baselines:  
- **Schedule Baseline**: The WBS and WBS Dictionary define project activities and milestones, which form the foundation for the schedule baseline.  
- **Cost Baseline**: The scope baseline defines the deliverables and work packages, which drive resource allocation and cost estimation.  
- **Quality Baseline**: Acceptance criteria defined in the scope baseline directly inform quality assurance and control processes.  

Together, these baselines ensure comprehensive project planning and control, enabling the team to deliver the project successfully within the defined constraints.  

---

## 5. Conclusion  

The Scope Baseline is a critical component of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project, providing the foundation for scope management, performance measurement, and change control. By following the processes outlined in this document, the project team ensures alignment with PMBOK standards, stakeholder expectations, and organizational goals, delivering the intended outcomes on time and within budget.
