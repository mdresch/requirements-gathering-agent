# Scope Baseline Document: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**Document ID:** RGA-SB-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2024
**Author:** Bard (AI-Generated, reviewed and approved by [Project Manager Name])


## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The Scope Baseline defines the features, functionality, and deliverables approved for inclusion in the project.  This baseline serves as the primary reference point for managing project scope, tracking progress, and controlling changes throughout the project lifecycle.  Deviations from this baseline will require formal change management procedures.

## 2. Project Scope Statement Summary

The RGA project aims to develop and deliver a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI (specifically supporting Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) to generate comprehensive PMBOK 7.0-compliant project management documentation from a project's existing documentation, primarily README.md files and associated markdown files within a standard project structure.  The tool will analyze the provided project documentation, identify relevant information, and utilize an enhanced context manager to generate a suite of 29 documents categorized into core analysis, project charter, management plans, planning artifacts, stakeholder management, and technical analysis. The tool will also include PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and a quality assessment feature providing detailed scores and recommendations.  The final deliverable will be a set of organized markdown files in a specified directory structure, along with comprehensive validation reports.

## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The approved WBS for the RGA project is detailed in Appendix A. This WBS decomposes the project into manageable work packages, providing a hierarchical structure for planning, scheduling, and execution.

## 4. WBS Dictionary

The WBS Dictionary, providing detailed descriptions of each work package identified in the WBS, is detailed in Appendix B.  This dictionary clarifies the scope and deliverables associated with each work package.

## 5. Scope Baseline Configuration Management

The scope baseline comprises the approved Project Scope Statement (Section 2), the approved WBS (Appendix A), and the approved WBS Dictionary (Appendix B).  Any changes to the scope baseline will be managed through a formal change control process as defined in the Project Management Plan.

## 6. Performance Measurement

The scope baseline will be used to measure project performance in several ways:

* **Progress Tracking:**  Completion of work packages within the WBS will be tracked against the project schedule.  Any deviations will be analyzed to identify potential scope creep or schedule slippage.
* **Deliverable Verification:**  Each deliverable will be verified against the descriptions provided in the WBS Dictionary to ensure it meets the defined requirements.
* **Variance Analysis:**  Regular analysis of earned value and schedule variance will be performed to identify and address any significant deviations from the scope baseline.

## 7. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates

The scope baseline will be maintained and updated through a formal change control process.  All change requests will be documented, evaluated, and approved or rejected by the Change Control Board (CCB).  Approved changes will result in a revised scope baseline, documented in a new version of this document.  The process for managing change requests includes:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  Stakeholders submit change requests through a designated process (e.g., a project management tool).
2. **Change Request Evaluation:**  The CCB assesses the impact of the change request on the project scope, schedule, cost, and risks.
3. **Change Request Approval/Rejection:**  The CCB approves or rejects the change request based on its evaluation.
4. **Scope Baseline Update:**  If approved, the scope baseline is updated to reflect the changes, and this document is revised.
5. **Communication:**  All stakeholders are informed of the change request status and any resulting updates to the scope baseline.


## 8. Relationship to Other Project Baselines

The scope baseline is intricately linked to other project baselines:

* **Schedule Baseline:**  The schedule baseline is dependent on the scope baseline.  Changes to the scope will likely necessitate changes to the schedule.
* **Cost Baseline:**  Similarly, changes to the scope will likely impact the project cost baseline.
* **Quality Baseline:**  The quality baseline defines the standards for deliverables.  Changes to the scope may require adjustments to quality standards.


## 9. Appendix A: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

[Insert detailed WBS here.  This could be a visual representation (e.g., an image of a WBS chart) or a textual representation using indentation to show the hierarchy.]  Example:

1. Project Initiation
    1.1 Project Charter Development
    1.2 Stakeholder Identification
    1.3 Kick-off Meeting
2. Requirements Gathering
    2.1 Requirements Elicitation
    2.2 Requirements Analysis
    2.3 Requirements Documentation
3. System Design
    3.1 Architectural Design
    3.2 Database Design
    3.3 API Design
...etc.


## 10. Appendix B: WBS Dictionary

[Insert detailed WBS Dictionary here.  This should list each work package from the WBS and provide a detailed description, including deliverables, responsible parties, and estimated effort.]  Example:

| Work Package ID | Description                                                              | Deliverables                                         | Responsible Party | Estimated Effort |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1.1             | Project Charter Development                                               | Project Charter Document                             | Project Manager     | 5 days            |
| 1.2             | Stakeholder Identification                                                 | Stakeholder Register                                  | Project Manager     | 3 days            |
| 1.3             | Kick-off Meeting                                                          | Meeting Minutes, Action Items                        | Project Manager     | 1 day             |
...etc.


This Scope Baseline document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment with project goals and stakeholder expectations.
