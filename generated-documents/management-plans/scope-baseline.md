# Scope Baseline Document: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**Document ID:** RGA-SB-001
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The scope baseline defines the features, functionality, and deliverables that constitute the completed project.  It serves as the primary reference for managing project scope, tracking progress, and controlling changes throughout the project lifecycle.  This baseline is based on the approved Project Scope Statement (referenced below) and the approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary (referenced below).

## 2. Project Scope Statement Summary

The RGA project aims to deliver a command-line interface (CLI) tool that utilizes AI (specifically supporting Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) to generate comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documentation. The tool will analyze project documentation (including but not limited to README.md, requirements documents, architecture files, stakeholder information, and planning documents) to create a suite of 29 PMBOK documents.  Key features include intelligent context building, PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation, cross-document consistency checks, and a robust error handling mechanism.  The complete list of generated documents is detailed in the approved Project Scope Statement (see Appendix A: 03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD).

## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary

The project's WBS, providing a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into manageable work packages, is detailed in  Appendix B: [Link to Approved WBS Document].  The associated WBS Dictionary, providing detailed descriptions of each work package, including its deliverables, responsible party, and estimated effort, is found in Appendix C: [Link to Approved WBS Dictionary].


## 4. Scope Baseline Components

The RGA project scope baseline comprises the following key components:

* **Project Scope Statement:**  A formal document describing the project's objectives, deliverables, and boundaries (Appendix A).
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A hierarchical decomposition of the project work into smaller, manageable components (Appendix B).
* **WBS Dictionary:** A description of each work package in the WBS, including details like deliverables, responsible parties, and duration estimates (Appendix C).


## 5. Performance Measurement

The scope baseline will be used to measure project performance in several ways:

* **Scope Verification:**  Regularly comparing the actual work performed against the planned work packages in the WBS.  This will involve reviewing deliverables against the acceptance criteria defined in the WBS Dictionary.
* **Earned Value Management (EVM):**  Tracking the planned value, earned value, and actual cost of the project to assess progress and identify variances.
* **Variance Analysis:** Analyzing differences between planned and actual scope to identify and address any deviations. This will include monitoring for scope creep.
* **Progress Reporting:** Regularly reporting on project progress against the planned scope, highlighting any issues or risks related to scope.


## 6. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates

The scope baseline is not static. Changes to the scope will be managed through a formal change control process.  This process involves:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  A formal request documenting the proposed change, its impact on the project, and the justification for the change.
2. **Change Request Evaluation:**  The change request will be reviewed by the project manager and relevant stakeholders to assess its feasibility, impact on cost and schedule, and alignment with project objectives.
3. **Change Approval/Rejection:**  The project manager or a designated change control board will approve or reject the change request.
4. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change will be implemented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.
5. **Scope Baseline Update Documentation:** The updated scope baseline will be documented and distributed to all relevant stakeholders.

All approved changes will be formally documented and integrated into the WBS, WBS Dictionary, and Project Scope Statement, resulting in a revised Scope Baseline.


## 7. Relationship to Other Baselines

The scope baseline is closely related to the other project baselines:

* **Schedule Baseline:** The approved project schedule, which is directly impacted by scope changes.
* **Cost Baseline:** The approved project budget, which is also affected by scope changes.
* **Quality Baseline:** The approved quality standards and processes, which may need adjustments based on scope changes.

This Scope Baseline document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any approved changes to the project scope.  Any changes will be documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
