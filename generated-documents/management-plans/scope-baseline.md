# Scope Baseline Document

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document ID:** RGA-SB-001

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The Scope Baseline defines the features, functionality, and deliverables that comprise the project.  This baseline serves as the primary reference point for managing project scope, controlling changes, and measuring project performance.  Any changes to the scope baseline will require formal change control procedures as outlined in the Change Management Plan (reference document RGA-CMP-001).


## 2. Approved Project Scope Statement (Summary)

The RGA project aims to develop an AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from a project's existing documentation, including the README file and other relevant markdown files.  The tool will integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), offer a modular architecture for extensibility, and provide robust validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards. The key deliverables include a functional CLI tool, comprehensive documentation (including user guides and API documentation), and a set of PMBOK-compliant document templates.  The full Project Scope Statement is available in document RGA-PSS-001.


## 3. Approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The project's Work Breakdown Structure is detailed in document RGA-WBS-001.  A summary is provided below:

5.0 Documentation
6.0 Testing
7.0 Deployment


## 4. Approved WBS Dictionary

The WBS Dictionary, providing detailed descriptions for each Work Breakdown Structure component, is available in document RGA-WBS-DICT-001.  This dictionary clarifies the scope and deliverables associated with each WBS element.


## 5. Scope Baseline Usage for Performance Measurement

The Scope Baseline will be used to measure project performance in several ways:

* **Earned Value Management (EVM):**  The WBS and WBS Dictionary will be used to define the planned value (PV) for each work package.  Actual progress will be measured against the planned value to calculate the earned value (EV) and ultimately the schedule and cost performance indices (SPI and CPI).
* **Scope Change Control:**  Any deviations from the approved scope baseline will be formally documented and evaluated through the change control process.
* **Deliverable Verification:** Each deliverable will be verified against the descriptions provided in the WBS Dictionary to ensure it meets the defined scope.


## 6. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates

The Scope Baseline is a living document.  However, changes to the scope baseline will only be made through a formal change control process, as defined in the Change Management Plan (RGA-CMP-001).  This process includes:

1. **Change Request Submission:** A formal change request must be submitted, documenting the proposed change, its justification, and its impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
2. **Change Request Evaluation:** The change request will be reviewed and evaluated by the project manager and relevant stakeholders.
3. **Change Approval/Rejection:** The change request will be approved or rejected based on its impact and feasibility.
4. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change will be implemented and documented.
5. **Scope Baseline Update:** The Scope Baseline document will be updated to reflect the approved changes.


## 7. Relationship to Other Project Baselines

The Scope Baseline is closely related to other project baselines, including:

* **Schedule Baseline:** The Scope Baseline defines *what* will be done, while the Schedule Baseline defines *when* it will be done.  Changes to the Scope Baseline will often necessitate changes to the Schedule Baseline.
* **Cost Baseline:** The Scope Baseline influences the Cost Baseline, as the scope of work directly impacts the project's resource requirements and budget.  Changes to the Scope Baseline will often necessitate changes to the Cost Baseline.
* **Quality Baseline:** The Scope Baseline specifies the quality requirements for each deliverable.  The Quality Baseline ensures that these requirements are met.


This Scope Baseline document, along with its referenced documents, provides a complete and unambiguous definition of the project scope.  Adherence to this baseline is crucial for successful project completion.
