# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the cost management plan for the ADPA project.  It details the methods and procedures used to estimate, budget, and control project costs, ensuring the project stays within the allocated budget and delivers value within financial constraints.  This plan adheres to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.


## 2. Cost Estimation

### 2.1  Estimation Techniques

The project will employ a combination of estimation techniques to account for the diverse nature of the project's tasks:

* **Bottom-Up Estimating:** This will be the primary technique for software development, testing, and documentation tasks. Individual tasks will be estimated based on their complexity and resource requirements.  Historical data from similar projects will inform these estimates.

* **Analogous Estimating:** This will be used for tasks similar to those in previous projects, leveraging past cost data as a baseline.

* **Parametric Estimating:** This will be used to estimate infrastructure costs (cloud services, etc.) based on known parameters like usage rates and pricing models.

### 2.2 Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS)

The following CBS categorizes project costs:

| Cost Category             | Description                                                                    | Estimated Cost (USD) |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Personnel Costs**       | Salaries, benefits, and other personnel-related expenses                       | $50,000                |
|   * Development           | Salaries for developers, testers, and AI specialists                          | $35,000                |
|   * Project Management    | Salaries for project manager and other administrative staff                  | $15,000                |
| **Software & Tools Costs** | Licenses, subscriptions, and other software-related expenses                 | $10,000                |
|   * Azure OpenAI Services | Costs associated with Azure OpenAI API usage                                  | $7,000                 |
|   * Other Software        | Licenses for development tools, testing frameworks, etc.                     | $3,000                 |
| **Infrastructure Costs**   | Cloud computing resources, server hosting, and other infrastructure expenses | $5,000                 |
| **Contingency Reserve**   | Buffer for unforeseen expenses                                                | $5,000                 |
| **Total Estimated Cost**   |                                                                                  | **$70,000**             |


**Note:** These cost estimates are preliminary and subject to change based on further project analysis and requirements.  The contingency reserve accounts for potential risks and uncertainties.


## 3. Budget Determination

The total estimated cost of $70,000 will serve as the project budget. This budget will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor.  Regular monitoring and control will ensure adherence to this budget.


## 4. Cost Control

### 4.1 Cost Performance Measurement

Regular monitoring of actual costs against the budget will be conducted using Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include:

* **Cost Variance (CV):**  Earned Value (EV) - Actual Cost (AC)
* **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - Planned Value (PV)
* **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV / AC
* **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV / PV

These KPIs will be tracked weekly and reported to the project manager and sponsor.

### 4.2 Change Control

Any changes to the project scope that impact the budget will be managed through a formal change control process.  All change requests will be evaluated for their impact on cost, schedule, and scope.  Approved changes will be incorporated into the budget and schedule, with updated cost estimates and baselines.

### 4.3 Cost Baseline

The approved budget of $70,000 will serve as the cost baseline.  This baseline will be used as a benchmark against which actual costs will be compared.  Any deviations from the baseline will be investigated and corrective actions will be implemented.


## 5. Reporting

Cost performance reports will be generated weekly and submitted to the project sponsor and stakeholders.  These reports will include:

* Summary of actual costs incurred.
* Comparison of actual costs to the cost baseline.
* Analysis of cost variances and their causes.
* Projected cost at completion.
* Recommended corrective actions.


## 6. Budget Management Tools

The project will utilize a spreadsheet-based budgeting tool for tracking and reporting project costs.  This tool will provide a centralized repository for all cost-related information, facilitating accurate and timely reporting.


## 7. Risk Management Related to Cost

The following risks related to cost have been identified:

| Risk                               | Impact             | Mitigation Strategy                                                                  |
|------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Increased Azure OpenAI API Usage   | Increased Costs     | Optimize AI prompts, monitor API usage, explore alternative cost-effective models    |
| Unexpected Software/Tool Costs     | Budget Overruns     | Thoroughly research and evaluate software and tool options before procurement         |
| Unforeseen Development Challenges  | Schedule Delays & Cost Overruns | Allocate contingency reserve, implement agile development methodologies, regular risk assessments |


This Cost Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the project scope, cost estimates, and risks.  The project manager is responsible for ensuring adherence to this plan and for promptly reporting any significant cost variances.
