# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Prepared by:** [Project Team/Consultant Name]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

---

## 1. Purpose

This Cost Management Plan defines the policies, processes, and tools for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and controlling costs throughout the lifecycle of the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework project. The plan supports ADPA’s goal of delivering a modular, enterprise-grade automation platform for AI-driven document generation and project/data management, compliant with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 standards.

---

## 2. Cost Management Approach

Cost management will be conducted in alignment with PMBOK 7th Edition and industry best practices. The approach includes:

- **Cost Estimation:** Use bottom-up and parametric estimation based on work breakdown structure (WBS), resource rates, licensing, and infrastructure requirements.
- **Cost Budgeting:** Aggregate estimated costs to establish an authorized baseline.
- **Cost Control:** Monitor actuals versus estimates, manage variances, perform forecasting, and report regularly.
- **Tooling:** Leverage modern project management tools (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) and financial reporting integrations.

## 3. Cost Estimation

### 3.1 Cost Categories

| Category                   | Description                                                                             |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Personnel**              | Developers (Node.js, TypeScript), QA/testers, Technical Writers, Project Managers       |
| **AI & Cloud Services**    | OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI, Adobe APIs, Microsoft Graph, cloud compute/storage     |
| **Licensing & Subscriptions** | API subscriptions, Node module licensing, Adobe Creative Suite, Azure/Cloud infra    |
| **Infrastructure**         | Servers (cloud VMs, Docker, Kubernetes), databases, storage, networking                 |
| **Third-Party Integrations** | Atlassian Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, version control (GitHub/GitLab/Azure DevOps)|
| **Security & Compliance**  | Tools for compliance (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS), monitoring, logging, auditing                |
| **Testing & QA**           | Automated testing frameworks (Jest), CI/CD pipeline costs, staging environments         |
| **Documentation & Training** | User guides, admin interface manuals, onboarding                                      |
| **Contingency Reserve**    | Risk allowance for unforeseen costs                                                     |

### 3.2 Estimation Methodology

- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decompose all deliverables (core modules, integrations, admin UI, API) into tasks.
- **Resource Rates:** Calculate based on blended rates for in-house and contractor resources.
- **Historical Data:** Leverage data from previous automation and integration projects.
- **Vendor Quotes:** Gather and validate quotes for cloud, AI, and integration services.
- **Contingency:** Add a percentage based on risk analysis (typically 10–20%).

---

## 4. Cost Baseline

The cost baseline will be established and approved during project initiation. It will include:

- **Summary by Phase:** (e.g., Q1: BABOK/PMBOK core, Q2: DMBOK, Dockerization, advanced analytics, Q3: SSO, workflow automation, mobile)
- **Milestone-Based Funding:** Tie expenditures to delivery of major features (see implementation milestones and roadmap).
- **Baseline Updates:** Any baseline changes require formal change control and sponsor approval.

---

## 5. Funding Requirements

- **Internal Funding:** Budget allocations from sponsoring departments (IT, Data, Business Analysis).
- **External Costs:** Subscription invoices for AI providers, Adobe, and cloud resources.
- **CapEx vs OpEx:** Classify costs appropriately for organizational accounting.

---

## 6. Cost Control & Monitoring

### 6.1 Cost Tracking

- **Actuals vs. Baseline:** Monthly tracking of spend against the approved baseline.
- **Variance Analysis:** Early identification of overruns; root cause analysis.
- **Forecasting:** Rolling forecasts updated with real-time project data and vendor usage reports.
- **Reporting:** Regular status reporting to project sponsors and PMO.

### 6.2 Tools & Processes

- **Financial Management Tools:** Integration with financial systems or use of project management platforms (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps boards with cost plugins).
- **Automated Alerts:** Set up budget threshold notifications for cloud/API usage.
- **Audit Trail:** Maintain detailed records for all major expenditures (especially for compliance).

---

## 7. Unique Project Cost Considerations

### 7.1 Multi-Provider AI Integration

- **Dynamic Cost Modelling:** Monitor API usage across OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama. Optimize provider usage to minimize costs (e.g., fallback to local models where feasible).
- **Usage-Based Charges:** Track tokens/requests for each AI service; regularly audit invoices.

### 7.2 Enterprise Integration & API-First Architecture

- **Licensing Costs:** Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, OAuth/SSO providers may have per-user or per-API-call fees.
- **Scaling Impacts:** Cloud infrastructure costs may grow with increased usage (e.g., document generation volume, API traffic).

### 7.3 Security & Compliance

- **Compliance Tooling:** Budget for tools and audits to ensure adherence to financial (Basel III, SOX), security (GDPR, PCI DSS), and industry (HIPAA, FedRAMP) standards.
- **Data Management:** Secure storage, encryption, and backup costs as required for regulatory compliance.

### 7.4 Development & Testing

- **CI/CD & Test Environments:** Cloud resources for automated testing, staging, and integration.
- **Test Data:** Ensure use of synthetic or anonymized data to avoid compliance breaches (may incur additional setup costs).

---

## 8. Change Management

- **Change Requests:** All cost-impacting changes are logged, assessed, and approved via the project’s established change control process.
- **Impact Analysis:** Each change request includes a detailed cost impact assessment and mitigation plan.
