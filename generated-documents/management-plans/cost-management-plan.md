# Cost Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Cost Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, controlling, and monitoring the costs of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The goal is to ensure the project is completed within the approved budget and to provide transparency and accountability for all project expenditures.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objective of this Cost Management Plan is to:

* Provide a realistic and accurate estimate of the total project cost.
* Establish a baseline budget for the project.
* Track and monitor actual costs against the budget.
* Identify and manage cost variances.
* Ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget.

**3. Units of Measure**

Costs will be measured in US Dollars (USD).  Time will be tracked in staff hours and calendar days.  Software licenses and cloud services will be tracked by cost per unit/month.

**4. Level of Precision and Accuracy**

The level of accuracy for cost estimates will vary depending on the stage of the project.  During the initial planning phase, estimates will be +/- 20% accurate. As the project progresses and more information becomes available, the accuracy will increase to +/- 10% during the execution phase and +/- 5% during the closeout phase.

**5. Organizational Procedures Links**

* **Procurement Management Plan:**  Details the processes for acquiring goods and services, impacting cost.
* **Resource Management Plan:**  Identifies resources (personnel, software, hardware) and their associated costs.
* **Risk Management Plan:**  Identifies potential cost risks and mitigation strategies.
* **Change Management Plan:**  Outlines the process for managing changes that affect project costs.

**6. Control Thresholds**

Cost variances will be monitored regularly.  The following thresholds will trigger a review and corrective action:

* **Cost Variance (CV) > +10%:**  A formal review meeting will be held to analyze the cause of the variance and develop corrective actions.
* **Schedule Variance (SV) impacting cost > +15%:** A formal review meeting will be held to analyze the cause of the variance and develop corrective actions.
* **Earned Value Management (EVM) CPI < 0.85 or SPI < 0.85:** A formal review meeting will be held to analyze the cause of the variance and develop corrective actions.

**7. Rules of Performance Measurement (Earned Value Management - EVM)**

EVM will be used to track project performance and cost.  Key metrics include:

* **Planned Value (PV):** The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work.
* **Earned Value (EV):** The value of work completed to date.
* **Actual Cost (AC):** The actual cost incurred to date.
* **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV/AC (measures cost efficiency).
* **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV/PV (measures schedule efficiency).
* **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC (measures cost difference).
* **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - PV (measures schedule difference).

**8. Reporting Formats**

Cost reports will be generated weekly and monthly.  Reports will include:

* Summary of actual costs incurred.
* Comparison of actual costs to the budget.
* Analysis of cost variances.
* Forecasts of future costs.
* CPI and SPI values.
* EVM charts and graphs.

**9. Process Descriptions**

* **Cost Planning:**  Develop a detailed cost baseline including all anticipated costs.
* **Cost Estimating:** Utilize bottom-up and analogous estimating techniques to determine the cost of each work package.
* **Cost Budgeting:**  Aggregate the cost estimates to create a project budget.
* **Cost Control:**  Monitor and control costs throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Cost Monitoring:**  Track actual costs and compare them to the budget.


**10. Funding Requirements**

The project will be funded through [Specify Funding Source, e.g., internal company funds, external investment].  A detailed budget breakdown is provided in Appendix A.

**11. Cost Change Control Process**

Any changes to the project scope that impact the budget will follow a formal change control process.  This process involves:

1. Submitting a formal change request.
2. Evaluating the impact of the change on the cost and schedule.
3. Obtaining approval from the change control board.
4. Updating the project budget and schedule.

**12. Cost Estimation Methods and Approach**

* **Bottom-up Estimating:**  The cost of each work package will be estimated individually and then aggregated to determine the total project cost. This approach will be used for the development and testing phases.
* **Analogous Estimating:**  Historical data from similar projects will be used to estimate the cost of certain tasks. This will be used for initial high-level costing of the project.
* **Expert Judgment:**  Opinions from subject matter experts will be incorporated into the cost estimates.

**13. Cost Tracking Approach**

Time tracking software (e.g., Jira, Toggl) will be used to track staff hours.  Invoices and receipts will be used to track expenses for software licenses, cloud services, and other project-related costs.  A dedicated project accountant will oversee cost tracking and reporting.

This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in scope, cost, or schedule.
