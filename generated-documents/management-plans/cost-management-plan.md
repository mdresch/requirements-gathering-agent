# Cost Management Plan: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the cost management plan for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automating the backup process and ensuring secure recovery.  The project aims to improve the existing backup system by implementing robust automation, enhanced security measures, and improved data integrity checks.  This will reduce operational costs associated with manual backups, potential data loss, and recovery efforts.

**2. Project Scope**

The project encompasses the design, development, implementation, and testing of an automated backup system for Project Backup Vermigerous. This includes:

* **Automated Backup Scheduling:** Implementing a scheduled backup process using appropriate tools (e.g., cron jobs, Azure Automation).
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:** Utilizing incremental or differential backup strategies to optimize storage space and backup times.
* **Validation & Integrity Checks:** Implementing checksum generation and validation to ensure data integrity.
* **Secure Storage Architecture:** Utilizing secure storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy) and encryption (AES-256, TLS).
* **Metadata Tagging & Categorization:** Automating metadata tagging for efficient backup retrieval.
* **Automated Recovery Testing:** Regularly testing the recovery process in a sandbox environment.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implementing monitoring and alerting to track backup status and identify issues.

**3. Cost Estimation**

The cost estimation is categorized into the following areas:

**3.1 Personnel Costs:**

| Role                | Hourly Rate | Estimated Hours | Total Cost |
|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| Senior DevOps Engineer | $100         | 80               | $8,000     |
| Junior DevOps Engineer | $75          | 40               | $3,000     |
| System Administrator | $90          | 20               | $1,800     |
| **Total Personnel Costs** |             |                 | **$12,800** |


**3.2 Software & Tools:**

* **Azure Blob Storage:** Costs will vary depending on storage usage.  A detailed cost analysis will be conducted based on projected storage needs.  (Budget: $1,000 - $3,000 annually)
* **Azure Automation (if used):**  Costs will depend on the chosen plan and usage. (Budget: $50 - $200 monthly)
* **Other Software/Licenses (if any):**  To be determined based on specific tool selections. (Budget: $0 - $500)

**3.3 Infrastructure Costs:**

* **Increased Server Resources (if needed):** To be determined based on performance testing and projected backup sizes. (Budget: $0 - $1,000 annually)

**3.4 Contingency:**

* A 10% contingency is included to account for unforeseen expenses. (Budget: $1,280 + $100 - $300 + $0 - $100 = $1,480 - $1,780)

**3.5 Total Estimated Costs:**

* **Minimum Estimated Cost:** $12,800 + $1,000 + $50 + $0 + $1,480 = **$15,330**
* **Maximum Estimated Cost:** $12,800 + $3,000 + $200 + $500 + $1,780 = **$18,330**

**Note:**  These are preliminary estimates. A more precise cost breakdown will be provided after a detailed requirements gathering and design phase.


**4. Cost Control Measures**

* **Regular Monitoring:**  Track expenses against the budget regularly.
* **Change Management:**  Any changes to the project scope will be assessed for their cost implications.
* **Time Tracking:**  Accurate time tracking for all personnel involved.
* **Resource Optimization:**  Efficient use of Azure services to minimize costs.
* **Contingency Planning:**  Address potential risks and allocate resources for mitigation.


**5. Reporting**

Cost reports will be generated and presented:

* **Weekly:**  Track progress and identify potential cost overruns early.
* **Monthly:**  Summarize expenses and compare them to the budget.
* **End of Project:**  Provide a final cost report summarizing all expenses.


**6. Budget Approval**

The proposed budget range of $15,330 - $18,330 will be submitted for approval to the relevant stakeholders.


**7. Appendix**

This section will include detailed cost breakdowns, vendor quotes, and other relevant supporting documents.


This Cost Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses to reflect any changes in scope, resource allocation, or cost estimates.
