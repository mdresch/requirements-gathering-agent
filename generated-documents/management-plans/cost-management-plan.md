# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.4  
**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Prepared By:** ADPA Project Management Office

---

## 1. Purpose

This Cost Management Plan defines the approach, processes, tools, and controls for managing costs throughout the lifecycle of the ADPA project. It ensures that all project financials are planned, estimated, budgeted, funded, managed, and controlled to achieve project objectives, in alignment with PMBOK 7th Edition standards and enterprise best practices.

---

## 2. Cost Management Approach

The ADPA project employs a hybrid Agile-Waterfall delivery model, with modular releases and ongoing integrations. Cost management will be centralized, leveraging modern project management tools, AI-powered forecasting, and tight integration with enterprise systems (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence, Azure DevOps).

**Key Principles:**
- Standards-compliant (PMBOK 7th, Basel III, SOX)
- Modular budgeting by work package, feature, and release
- Proactive variance analysis (EVM, KPIs)
- Continuous cost monitoring and adaptive control mechanisms

---

## 3. Cost Estimation

### 3.1 Estimation Methodology

- **Bottom-up Estimation:** Each major module (AI Processing, API/CLI, Integrations, Admin UI) is decomposed into work packages using the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
- **Analogous Estimation:** Reference to similar enterprise automation projects for calibration.
- **Parametric Estimation:** Use of metrics (e.g., function points, story points, resource hours).
- **Three-Point Estimation:** For high-variability components (e.g., AI integrations, security).

### 3.2 Tools

- Cost estimation will be managed using MS Excel, Jira Advanced Roadmaps, and Confluence budget artifacts.
- Automated cost estimation routines will be built into the ADPA documentation generator for ongoing recalibration.

### 3.3 Key Cost Categories

| Category                       | Description                                                |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Labor                          | Developers, architects, QA, BA, PM, DevOps                 |
| AI Provider Usage              | OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI API/token usage fees       |
| Platform & Infrastructure      | Cloud hosting (Vercel, Azure, AWS), storage, compute       |
| Third-Party Integrations       | Adobe PDF Services, Confluence, SharePoint, SSO            |
| Licensing & Compliance         | MIT license management, compliance audits                  |
| Testing & QA                   | Automated and manual test environments                     |
| Training & Documentation       | User guides, onboarding, support docs                      |
| Contingency                    | Reserve for risk events (scope creep, regulatory change)   |

## 4. Budgeting

### 4.1 Budget Baseline

- **Initial Baseline:** Established at project kickoff, based on approved WBS and high-level estimates.
- **Budget Breakdown:** Allocated by release, module, and integration (see WBS Dictionary).
- **Contingency Reserve:** 10% of total baseline for known-unknowns; managed at the program level.
- **Management Reserve:** 5% controlled by the steering committee for unforeseen issues.

### 4.2 Funding

- Funding is authorized in quarterly tranches, linked to milestone and deliverable acceptance.
- All major expenditures require pre-approval and are tracked in the enterprise project management tool.

### 4.3 Cost Control Accounts

- Each module (e.g., AI Engine, REST API, Admin UI) is assigned a unique cost control account.
- All costs are logged against these accounts for traceability and reporting.

---

## 5. Cost Control and Monitoring

### 5.1 Performance Measurement

- **Earned Value Management (EVM):** Schedule Performance Index (SPI), Cost Performance Index (CPI), Estimate at Completion (EAC) reported monthly.
- **KPIs:** Budget Variance, Burn Rate, Feature Cost per Release, AI Token Utilization.

### 5.2 Change Control

- All cost-affecting changes require an impact analysis and must be reviewed by the Change Control Board (CCB).
- The Adaptive Scope Control system provides real-time alerts for scope changes with cost impact.

### 5.3 Variance Analysis

- Automated variance reports generated weekly via the ADPA analytics module.
- Any variance >10% triggers root cause analysis and corrective action.

### 5.4 Reporting

- Monthly cost reports delivered to stakeholders via Confluence.
- On-demand dashboards available in the Admin Web Interface (Next.js portal).

## 6. Cost Management Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                        |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager       | Owns overall budget, cost tracking, and reporting                       |
| Business Analyst      | Supports estimation, ensures requirements/cost alignment                |
| Architects/Developers | Provide input to effort and resource estimates                          |
| Financial Controller  | Oversight of expenditures, compliance, and audits                       |
| QA Lead               | Manages test environment and related costs                              |
| PMO/Steering Committee| Approves major changes, controls management reserve                     |

## 7. Tools, Systems, and Integration

- **Primary Tools:** Jira, Confluence, SharePoint, Next.js Admin Portal, ADPA CLI/API
- **AI Cost Tracking:** Automated logging of AI token/usage costs by provider (OpenAI, Google, Azure, Ollama)
- **Integration with Enterprise Systems:** Cost data is synchronized with ERP and financial systems as needed

---

## 8. Cost Management Process Workflow

1. **Estimate Costs:** At planning and prior to each major release/iteration.
2. **Establish Budget:** Approve baseline and reserves.
3. **Monitor and Control:** Use real-time dashboards, EVM, and variance analysis.
4. **Report:** Regular status to stakeholders, with recommendations.
5. **Adjust:** Implement corrective actions or re-baseline as required.

---

## 9. Risk and Contingency Planning

- **Identified Risks:** AI provider price volatility, unexpected integration complexity, regulatory changes.
- **Contingency Strategies:** Maintain reserve funds, modularize scope, enable rapid vendor/provider switching, leverage local (Ollama) AI models when feasible.
- **Automated Alerts:** Adaptive analytics provide early warning on cost overruns or high-risk trends.

---

## 10. Metrics and Continuous Improvement

- Review cost KPIs after each release.
- Leverage AI-driven predictive analytics to refine future estimates.
- Conduct cost audits post-milestone for lessons learned.

---

## 11. Approvals and Updates

- This plan is approved by the Project Manager and Steering Committee.
- Updates are version-controlled in the project repository and tracked via the ADPA frameworkâ€™s documentation generator.
