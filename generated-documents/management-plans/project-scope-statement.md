**Project Scope Statement**

**1. Project Title:** Requirements Gathering Agent Documentation Generation

**2. Project Manager:** [Project Manager Name]

**3. Date:** October 26, 2023

**4. Project Sponsor:** [Sponsor Name/Title]

**5. Project Objectives:**  To create a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project management documents automatically generated from existing project documentation, leveraging AI capabilities to enhance accuracy and efficiency.  This includes generating at least the following document types: Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, Quality Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Communication Management Plan, Procurement Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, Activity List and Estimates, Schedule Network Diagram, Milestone List, Stakeholder Register, Stakeholder Engagement Plan, and Stakeholder Analysis.  The system should also provide a quality assessment and PMBOK compliance validation report for each generated document.

**6. Project Deliverables:**

*   A functional Node.js/TypeScript application (Requirements Gathering Agent) capable of processing project documentation and generating PMBOK-compliant documents.
*   A comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project management documents (as listed in Project Objectives).
*   A user manual for the Requirements Gathering Agent application.
*   A quality assessment report detailing the quality scores and recommendations for each generated document.
*   A PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation report for each generated document.


**7. Project Scope:**

**7.1 Included:**

*   Analysis of provided project documentation (README.md and associated files within specified directories, as detailed in the README).
*   Generation of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documents.
*   Integration with Azure OpenAI (with fallback to other providers as defined in the application's configuration).
*   Compliance validation against PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
*   Quality assessment scoring and recommendations for generated documents.
*   A command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
*   Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms.
*   Generation of a well-organized directory structure for output documents.


**7.2 Excluded:**

*   Manual review and editing of generated documents.  The tool aims to automate the process, but human review may be necessary for final approval.
*   Integration with external project management software beyond the scope of file input/output.
*   Customization of document templates beyond those provided by the application.
*   Support for file formats other than those explicitly supported (primarily Markdown and JSON).
*   Training on PMBOK methodologies (this is assumed as pre-existing knowledge).
*   Ongoing maintenance and updates beyond the initial release version.


**8. Project Boundaries:**

The project is bounded by the completion of the initial release version of the Requirements Gathering Agent, including all core functionalities as defined in the deliverables and scope.  Future enhancements and expansions will be considered in separate project proposals.

**9. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful generation of all specified PMBOK documents with a quality assessment score above a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 80/100).
*   Successful validation of generated documents against PMBOK 7th Edition standards with a compliance score above a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 90/100).
*   Successful execution of all CLI commands as defined in the application's documentation.
*   Positive user feedback from a defined group of testers.


**10. Assumptions and Constraints:**

*   The project assumes the availability of relevant project documentation in a readily accessible format.
*   The project assumes access to a suitable AI provider API (Azure OpenAI is preferred, but alternatives are supported).
*   The project is constrained by the availability of resources (time, budget, personnel).
*   The project is constrained by the limitations of the AI provider's capabilities.


**11. Stakeholders:**

*   [List key stakeholders and their roles]


This Project Scope Statement serves as a baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent project and will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to the scope will be formally documented and approved by the project sponsor.
