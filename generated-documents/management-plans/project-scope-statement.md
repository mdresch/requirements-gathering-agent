## Project Scope Statement: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**2. Project Identifier:** RGA-2024-10-27 (Example - Replace with actual ID)

**3. Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name]

**4. Date:** October 27, 2024

**5. 1.0 Introduction:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project aims to develop and deliver a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI (specifically Azure OpenAI, with fallback options for Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on existing project documentation.  This tool will adhere to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and provide features for validation and quality assessment of the generated documents. The project will prioritize scalability, maintainability, and robust error handling.

**6. 2.0 Project Objectives:**

* Automate the creation of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documentation.
* Reduce the time and effort required for manual documentation creation.
* Improve the accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* Enhance stakeholder communication and alignment.
* Provide a flexible and extensible platform for future enhancements and integrations.
* Achieve a minimum of 90% PMBOK 7th Edition compliance in generated documents.
* Maintain a 99% uptime for the CLI tool.
* Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars based on user feedback.

**7. 3.0 Project Deliverables:**

* A functional CLI tool (requirements-gathering-agent) deployable via npm.
* Comprehensive documentation including a user guide, API reference, and troubleshooting guide.
* A set of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant documents (as listed in the README, including Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc.).
* Automated test suite with high code coverage.
* Automated deployment pipeline.


**8. 4.0 Project Scope:**

**4.1 Included:**

* Development of the core CLI application using Node.js and TypeScript.
* Integration with selected AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) using their respective APIs.
* Implementation of an intelligent context management system to optimize AI model input.
* Generation of a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant documents.
* Implementation of validation and quality assessment features for generated documents.
* Creation of comprehensive documentation for the tool and its usage.
* Development and execution of a robust testing strategy.
* Deployment of the application to npm.

**4.2 Excluded:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (beyond basic file import).
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Support for non-markdown file types as direct input (beyond metadata extraction).
* Provisioning and management of the AI provider accounts and resources (users are responsible for obtaining and managing their API keys).
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial release (will be considered in a separate maintenance project).

**9. 5.0 Acceptance Criteria:**

* The CLI tool successfully generates all specified PMBOK documents.
* The generated documents achieve a minimum 90% PMBOK 7th Edition compliance score based on automated validation.
* The tool successfully integrates with at least one of the supported AI providers.
* The tool demonstrates robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
* The user documentation is complete and comprehensible.
* The automated test suite achieves at least 95% code coverage.


**10. 6.0 Project Constraints:**

* The project must be completed within [Insert Timeframe].
* The budget is limited to [Insert Budget].
* The team size is limited to [Insert Team Size].
* Reliance on external AI provider APIs and their availability.


**11. 7.0 Assumptions:**

* The necessary AI provider API keys and access will be provided.
* The project will have access to sufficient computational resources.
* The project team will have the necessary skills and expertise.


**12. 8.0 Stakeholders:**

* [List Key Stakeholders and their roles]


**13. 9.0  Project Deliverables Timeline:** (This section would include a Gantt chart or similar visual representation of the project timeline and dependencies).  This is omitted here for brevity, but is a crucial component of a real-world Project Scope Statement.


This Project Scope Statement serves as a baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Any changes to the scope will be formally documented and approved through the established change management process.
