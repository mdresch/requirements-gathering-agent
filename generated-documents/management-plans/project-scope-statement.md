# Project Scope Statement  

## Project Title: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. By leveraging Azure OpenAI and other AI providers, this tool aims to reduce manual effort, improve compliance, ensure stakeholder alignment, and enhance documentation accuracy. This project addresses the inefficiencies in traditional project documentation processes by delivering automated, standardized artifacts aligned with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.

---

## 2. Project Objectives  

- Automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documents for software projects.  
- Ensure cross-document consistency and compliance with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  
- Provide enhanced AI-powered context management with support for large language models (up to 2M tokens).  
- Offer a modular, scalable architecture for future integration with third-party project management tools.  
- Deliver a user-friendly CLI interface for document generation, validation, and management.  
- Achieve enterprise-grade functionality with robust error handling, retry logic, and multi-provider AI support.

## 3. Scope Description  

### In-Scope Items  
The following deliverables and activities are included within the project scope:  
1. **Document Generation**:  
   - Generation of 29 PMBOK-compliant documents, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures (WBS).  
   - Validation of existing project documentation against PMBOK standards.  

2. **AI Integration**:  
   - Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) for enhanced document quality.  
   - Development of a 3-phase Enhanced Context Manager to maximize AI model token utilization and provide rich project context.  

3. **CLI Interface**:  
   - Development of a Command-Line Interface (CLI) with support for batch processing, retry mechanisms, and user-friendly configuration management.  
   - Interactive AI provider selection menu for improved user experience.  

4. **Documentation Analysis**:  
   - Comprehensive analysis of project documentation to discover and prioritize relevant sources (e.g., README.md, requirements, architecture docs, stakeholder files).  
   - Smart relevance scoring and categorization of project files.  

5. **Compliance and Validation**:  
   - PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation for all generated documents.  
   - Cross-document consistency checks to ensure alignment and traceability.  

6. **Output and Reporting**:  
   - Structured output directories containing categorized documents.  
   - Quality assessment and compliance reports, including actionable recommendations for improvement.  

### Out-of-Scope Items  
The following items are not included within the project scope:  
1. Development of complex integrations with external project management software beyond basic modular architecture.  
2. Support for legacy AI models or providers not meeting token requirements for Enhanced Context Manager.  
3. Manual generation or editing of project documentation outside of the automated workflows.

## 4. Deliverables  

### Core Deliverables  
- **PMBOK-Compliant Documents**: Generation of documents across initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing process groups.  
- **Enhanced Context Manager**: Intelligent context strategy for optimizing AI model utilization.  
- **CLI Tool**: Fully functional CLI interface with interactive AI provider selection and configuration management.  
- **Validation Reports**: PMBOK compliance and quality assessment reports for generated documents.

## 5. Project Constraints  

### Constraints  
- **Documentation Quality**: The quality of generated documents depends on the relevance and completeness of the source documentation provided (e.g., README.md, requirements files).  
- **AI Model Token Limitations**: Model capacity (e.g., token limits) may constrain the depth of context utilized for document generation.  
- **PMBOK Standards**: All generated outputs must align with PMBOK 7th Edition standards, which may require iterative adjustments and validation.  

---

## 6. Assumptions  

- Comprehensive project documentation will be provided to support AI-powered analysis and document generation.  
- AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, etc.) will reliably support large-context processing without outages during the project's duration.  
- Stakeholders will actively participate in validation workshops to approve generated deliverables.  
- The CLI interface will be compatible with Node.js environments and widely supported operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria  

The project will be considered successful upon meeting the following criteria:  
1. Generation of all core PMBOK documents, validated for compliance and completeness.  
2. CLI interface operating with minimal errors and providing intuitive commands for document generation and validation.  
3. Enhanced Context Manager successfully utilizing up to 90% of token capacity for large AI models.  
4. Consistent cross-document references and alignment with stakeholder expectations.  
5. Delivery of structured output directories containing categorized and validated documents.  
6. Achievement of enterprise-grade error handling, retry logic, and modular extensibility.
