## Work Performance Information - Scope (Requirements Gathering Agent)

This Work Performance Information (WPI) focuses on scope management for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, based on the provided project README and related documentation.  The WPI utilizes a structured format to present key information concerning scope performance.

**1. Project Overview:**

* **Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent
* **Project Goal:** Automate the generation of comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project management documentation using AI.
* **Project Deliverables:**  29 PMBOK-compliant documents (including Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, WBS, Stakeholder Register, etc.), organized into a professional directory structure.  Additionally, the project delivers a CLI tool for document generation and management, including version control functionality.
* **Scope Baseline:** Defined by the project README, supplemented by the detailed document specifications implicitly defined within the README. The scope includes the core functionality of document generation, AI integration with multiple providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama),  comprehensive project analysis, and the enhanced context manager. The scope also includes the CLI interface and version control system.

**2. Scope Performance Measurement:**

* **Metrics:**
    * **Number of Documents Generated:** Track the total number of documents successfully generated.
    * **Document Completeness:** Measure the percentage of required elements present in each generated document based on PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
    * **Document Quality Score:** Assess the quality of each document based on a defined scoring rubric (e.g., clarity, completeness, accuracy, consistency).
    * **Validation Success Rate:** Track the percentage of documents successfully validated against PMBOK standards.
    * **Number of Bugs/Defects:** Record the number of defects identified during testing and post-release.
    * **User Satisfaction:** Gather feedback from users to measure satisfaction with the tool's functionality and output.
    * **Context Utilization Rate:** Track the percentage of available tokens utilized by the AI models during document generation.
* **Data Sources:**  Automated validation reports, user feedback surveys, system logs, and manual inspection of generated documents.
* **Reporting Frequency:** Weekly progress reports, a final comprehensive report upon project completion.

**3. Scope Variance Analysis:**

* **Variance Types:**
    * **Scope Creep:**  Any unauthorized changes or additions to the project scope.  Tracked through change requests and deviations from the baseline.
    * **Scope Reduction:**  Any deliberate reduction in the project scope (e.g., removal of planned features).  Tracked via change requests and approved scope changes.
* **Variance Measurement:** Quantify scope creep/reduction using metrics such as the number of additional features added or removed, effort hours impacted, and cost implications.
* **Variance Response:**  Address scope variances through formal change management processes, updating the scope baseline as needed, and communicating changes to stakeholders.

**4. Scope Control:**

* **Change Control Process:**  A formal process for managing and approving changes to the project scope.  This includes a change request form, review and approval process, impact assessment, and communication plan.
* **Configuration Management:**  A system for managing and tracking all project documents and artifacts, ensuring version control and consistency.  The project leverages the built-in VCS within the generated documents directory.
* **Scope Verification:**  A process for ensuring that the project deliverables meet the defined scope. This involves formal reviews, testing, and validation against PMBOK standards.

**5. Risk Management Related to Scope:**

* **Identified Risks:**
    * **Incomplete Requirements:**  Ambiguous or missing requirements leading to inaccurate or incomplete document generation.
    * **AI Model Limitations:**  AI models may not always produce perfect results, requiring manual review and correction.
    * **Scope Creep:**  Uncontrolled additions to the project scope, causing delays and cost overruns.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Comprehensive Requirements Gathering:**  Thorough elicitation and documentation of requirements.
    * **Manual Review and Quality Assurance:**  Regular review of generated documents by experienced project managers.
    * **Formal Change Control Process:**  Strict adherence to the change management process.

**6. Earned Value Management (EVM) Integration:**

The scope baseline will be used to define the planned value (PV) for EVM.  The actual progress will be measured using the metrics defined above, which will contribute to the earned value (EV) calculation.  This will allow for monitoring and tracking of scope performance against the project plan.


This WPI provides a framework for monitoring and controlling the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Regular updates and analysis of this information will be crucial for ensuring the project remains on track and delivers its intended outcomes.  The dynamic nature of AI and the project's iterative development necessitates continuous monitoring and adaptation of this WPI.
