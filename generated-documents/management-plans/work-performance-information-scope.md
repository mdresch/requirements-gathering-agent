## Work Performance Information - Scope (Requirements Gathering Agent)

This Work Performance Information (WPI) report focuses on scope management for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, using PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  It summarizes the current state of the project scope, identifies variances, and proposes corrective actions.

**1. Project Overview:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project README files and associated documentation.  Key features include multi-AI provider support, enhanced context management, and PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation.  The project is currently in a post-release phase, celebrating a milestone of 175 weekly downloads.

**2. Scope Baseline:**

The initial scope baseline was defined by the project charter and included the generation of a comprehensive suite of 29 PMBOK documents.  This baseline is documented in the project charter and detailed specifications within the project's documentation directory.  Key deliverables included:

*   **Core Analysis:** Project Summary, User Stories, User Personas, Key Roles Analysis.
*   **Project Charter:** PMBOK Project Charter.
*   **Management Plans:** Scope, Risk, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communication, Procurement Management Plans.
*   **Planning Artifacts:** WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule Network Diagram, Milestone List.
*   **Stakeholder Management:** Stakeholder Register, Engagement Plan, Analysis.
*   **Technical Analysis:** Technology Stack, Data Model Suggestions, Risk Analysis, Acceptance Criteria, Compliance, UI/UX Considerations.
*   **Project KickOff Preparations Checklist:** (Added post-baseline)

**3. Work Performance Data:**

*   **Documents Generated:** All documents in the baseline scope have been generated and are available in the `generated-documents` directory.  The Project KickOff Preparations Checklist has been successfully added as a new deliverable.
*   **Completed Tasks:**  All major development tasks (context management, AI integration, document generation engine, CLI) have been completed and tested.
*   **Issues:**  Several issues have been identified and resolved (see Project README for details).  These include issues related to context utilization in large language models and CLI permission issues.
*   **Changes:**  Scope changes were managed through a formal change request process. The addition of the Project KickOff Preparations Checklist represents a controlled scope change.
*   **Quality:** PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation is performed for each document.  Quality scores are generated and reported, allowing for iterative improvements.
*   **Schedule:** The project is currently ahead of schedule, as evidenced by the successful release and milestone achievement.
*   **Budget:** The budget is currently within the planned limits.
*   **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** User feedback is positive, reflected in the 175 weekly downloads milestone.

**4. Scope Variance Analysis:**

*   **Planned Value (PV):** The total planned effort for the initial scope.
*   **Earned Value (EV):**  The value of the completed work based on the initial scope.
*   **Actual Cost (AC):** The actual cost incurred for the completed work.
*   **Schedule Variance (SV):**  SV = EV - PV. A positive SV indicates the project is ahead of schedule.
*   **Cost Variance (CV):** CV = EV - AC. A positive CV indicates the project is under budget.
*   **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** SPI = EV / PV.  An SPI greater than 1 indicates the project is ahead of schedule.
*   **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** CPI = EV / AC. A CPI greater than 1 indicates the project is under budget.

*(Specific numerical values for PV, EV, AC, SV, CV, SPI, and CPI would be calculated based on the project's cost and schedule baselines.)*

**5. Corrective Actions:**

While the project is currently performing well, ongoing monitoring and corrective action are vital.  The following actions will be taken:

*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Track key metrics (downloads, user feedback, bug reports) to identify potential issues early.
*   **Proactive Risk Management:** Regularly review and update the Risk Management Plan to address emerging risks.
*   **Documentation Updates:** Keep all documentation (including this WPI) up-to-date to reflect the project's current status.
*   **Further Development:** Explore the suggestions for improvement outlined in the README, focusing on asynchronous processing and improved context management for large projects.

**6. Conclusion:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent project is progressing successfully and ahead of schedule.  The scope is well-defined and managed.  Continuous monitoring and proactive risk management will ensure the project continues to meet its objectives.  Further development will focus on enhancing the tool's capabilities and scalability.
