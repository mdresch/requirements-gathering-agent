# Quality Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the processes, procedures, and standards used to ensure the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) software project delivers high-quality deliverables that meet stakeholder expectations and comply with PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The plan focuses on preventing defects, ensuring consistent output, and continuously improving the RGA's capabilities.

**2. Quality Standards**

* **PMBOK 7th Edition:** The project will adhere to the quality management principles and processes defined in the PMBOK Guide, 7th Edition.  This includes focusing on the performance domains of the project, such as project integration management, stakeholder management, and risk management.
* **ISO 9126:**  Software quality characteristics (Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Efficiency, Maintainability, Portability) will be considered throughout the development lifecycle.
* **Coding Standards:** The project will follow consistent coding standards (e.g.,  TypeScript style guide) to enhance code readability, maintainability, and reduce errors.
* **Testing Standards:**  Testing procedures will follow established industry best practices, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

**3. Quality Objectives**

* **Defect Rate:** Achieve a defect rate of less than 2 defects per 1000 lines of code (LOC).
* **Test Coverage:** Achieve 90% code coverage through unit and integration tests.
* **User Satisfaction:** Achieve a user satisfaction rating of at least 4.5 out of 5 based on UAT feedback.
* **PMBOK Compliance:**  All generated documents must meet the criteria defined in the PMBOK 7th Edition.
* **On-time Delivery:** Deliver all planned features on schedule.

**4. Quality Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for quality management, ensuring adherence to the QMP.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for writing high-quality code, performing unit testing, and participating in code reviews.
* **QA Team:** Responsible for designing and executing integration, system, and UAT testing, reporting defects, and verifying fixes.
* **AI Integration Specialist:** Responsible for ensuring proper integration and performance of chosen AI providers.

**5. Quality Deliverables and Processes**

* **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for all code changes to identify defects early.
* **Unit Testing:**  Unit tests for all modules to verify individual components' functionality.
* **Integration Testing:** Integration tests to verify the interaction between modules.
* **System Testing:** System tests to verify the overall system functionality and performance.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  UAT with representative users to validate the system meets requirements.
* **Documentation:**  High-quality user documentation, including tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and API documentation.  This also includes the PMBOK documents generated by the RGA itself.
* **Release Notes:** Detailed release notes documenting changes, bug fixes, and known issues for each release.

**6. Quality Control Activities**

* **Defect Tracking:**  Use a defect tracking system to record, track, and manage defects throughout the development lifecycle.
* **Regular Testing:** Execute unit, integration, system, and UAT testing at various stages of development.
* **Code Analysis:** Utilize static code analysis tools to identify potential defects and coding style violations.
* **Peer Reviews:**  Conduct regular peer reviews of documentation.


**7. Quality Assurance Activities**

* **Quality Audits:** Conduct periodic quality audits to verify adherence to the QMP and identify areas for improvement.
* **Process Improvement:**  Regularly review and update the QMP based on lessons learned and feedback.
* **Metrics Tracking:** Track key quality metrics (defect rate, test coverage, user satisfaction) to monitor progress and identify trends.
* **Compliance Reviews:** Ensure generated PMBOK documents meet the defined standards and guidelines.

**8. Quality Improvement Approaches**

* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
* **Agile Methodology:**  Utilize agile principles for iterative development and feedback loops.
* **Root Cause Analysis:**  Perform root cause analysis for critical defects to prevent recurrence.
* **Lessons Learned:** Document lessons learned from each iteration and release to improve future development cycles.

**9. Quality Tools and Techniques**

* **Defect Tracking System:** Jira, Azure DevOps, or similar.
* **Test Management Tool:** TestRail, Zephyr, or similar.
* **Static Code Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, ESLint.
* **Performance Testing Tools:** JMeter, LoadRunner.
* **Code Coverage Tools:** Istanbul, Jest coverage.
