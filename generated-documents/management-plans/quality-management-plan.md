# Quality Management Plan

**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicles (SCEV)

**1. Purpose**

This document outlines the quality management approach for the SCEV project.  It defines the processes, procedures, and standards to ensure the project delivers a high-quality, safe, and reliable self-charging electric vehicle.

**2. Scope**

This plan covers all aspects of quality management throughout the SCEV project lifecycle, including:

*   **Requirements Management:** Ensuring clear, complete, and verifiable requirements are defined and managed.
*   **Design and Development:** Implementing robust design processes, including design reviews and testing.
*   **Verification and Validation:**  Employing rigorous testing methods to validate the functionality and performance of the vehicle and its subsystems.
*   **Manufacturing and Assembly:** Establishing quality control procedures for the manufacturing and assembly processes.
*   **Supplier Management:** Managing quality aspects of procured components and services.

**3. Quality Objectives**

*   **Functional Performance:** The SCEV will meet or exceed predefined performance targets for range extension through energy harvesting.  Specific metrics will be defined based on simulation and testing results (Milestone 1).
*   **Safety:** The SCEV will meet or exceed all relevant safety standards and regulations for electric vehicles.  Safety will be a paramount concern throughout the design and development process.
*   **Reliability:** The SCEV will demonstrate high reliability and durability through rigorous testing and validation.  Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) targets will be established.
*   **Efficiency:** The energy harvesting systems will achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** The cost of implementing the self-charging technology will be optimized without compromising quality or safety.


**4. Quality Management Processes**

*   **Requirements Traceability:** A robust traceability matrix will be maintained to link requirements to design, code, test cases, and verification results.
*   **Design Reviews:** Formal design reviews will be conducted at key milestones (M1, M2, M3) to identify and address potential design flaws and risks.
*   **Testing and Validation:**  A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented, including unit, integration, system, and environmental testing.  Testing methodologies will be defined for each subsystem (photovoltaic panels, regenerative suspension, TEG, EMU).  Test results will be documented and analyzed.
*   **Defect Tracking and Resolution:** A defect tracking system will be used to manage and track defects identified during the development and testing phases.  A defined process for defect resolution and verification will be followed.
*   **Configuration Management:**  A configuration management system will be used to manage and control all project artifacts, including requirements, designs, code, and test results.
*   **Risk Management:**  Potential risks to quality will be identified, analyzed, and mitigated throughout the project lifecycle.  A risk register will be maintained and regularly updated.
*   **Quality Audits:** Regular quality audits will be performed to assess compliance with quality standards and procedures.


**5. Quality Metrics**

The following metrics will be used to monitor and track project quality:

*   **Defect Density:** Number of defects per thousand lines of code (for software components).
*   **Test Coverage:** Percentage of requirements covered by test cases.
*   **Defect Resolution Time:** Time taken to resolve defects.
*   **Energy Harvesting Efficiency:** Percentage of harvested energy converted to usable power.
*   **Range Extension:**  Increase in vehicle range due to energy harvesting.
*   **Customer Satisfaction:** Feedback from test drivers and early adopters.


**6. Quality Assurance and Control**

A dedicated Quality Assurance (QA) team will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the quality management plan.  This includes:

*   Monitoring adherence to quality processes and procedures.
*   Conducting regular quality audits.
*   Reviewing test results and defect reports.
*   Providing recommendations for process improvements.


**7. Tools and Technologies**

The project will leverage appropriate tools and technologies to support quality management activities, including:

*   Requirements Management Tool (e.g., Jira, Confluence)
*   Defect Tracking System (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla)
*   Configuration Management System (e.g., Git)
*   Test Management Tool (e.g., TestRail)
*   Simulation Software (for energy harvesting modelling)


**8. Roles and Responsibilities**

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for quality management will be documented in a separate RACI matrix.

**9. Continuous Improvement**

The quality management plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to incorporate lessons learned and best practices.  Continuous improvement will be a key focus throughout the project lifecycle.


This Quality Management Plan will be reviewed and updated at each project milestone to reflect the evolving needs of the project.  Its successful implementation is crucial to the delivery of a high-quality Self-Charging Electric Vehicle.
