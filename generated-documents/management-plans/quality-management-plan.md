# Quality Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the processes, procedures, and standards for ensuring the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) software project delivers high-quality deliverables that meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  This plan adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines and incorporates the project's unique aspects, such as AI integration and PMBOK document generation.

**2. Quality Standards**

* **PMBOK 7th Edition:** The project will adhere to the standards and best practices defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 7th Edition, particularly focusing on the Quality Management knowledge area.
* **ISO 9126:**  Software quality characteristics (functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability) will be considered throughout the development lifecycle.
* **Coding Standards:**  The project will follow established coding standards (e.g., TypeScript coding conventions) to ensure code readability, maintainability, and consistency.  Specific standards will be documented in a separate Coding Standards document.
* **Document Standards:**  All generated PMBOK documents will adhere to a defined template and style guide to ensure consistency and readability. This style guide will be included as an appendix.


**3. Quality Objectives**

* **Accuracy:**  Generated PMBOK documents must be accurate and reflect the project's actual context.  Accuracy will be measured by comparing generated documents to manually created equivalents (see Section 10).
* **Completeness:** All required sections and elements of each PMBOK document must be present and fully populated.
* **Consistency:**  Terminology and formatting must be consistent across all generated documents.
* **Compliance:** Generated documents must comply with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
* **Usability:** The RGA CLI should be intuitive and easy to use.
* **Reliability:** The RGA should function reliably and handle errors gracefully.

**4. Quality Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for quality management, ensuring the QMP is followed and corrective actions are taken.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for writing high-quality, well-tested code and adhering to coding standards.  They will perform unit and integration testing.
* **QA Engineer (if applicable):**  Responsible for independent testing, including functional, performance, and security testing.  Creates and executes test cases.  Produces test reports.
* **AI Model Validator:** Responsible for validating the AI model's outputs for accuracy and adherence to quality objectives.

**5. Quality Deliverables and Processes**

* **Quality Management Plan (this document):** Defines the overall quality management approach.
* **Coding Standards Document:** Defines coding conventions and best practices.
* **Document Style Guide:** Defines formatting and stylistic standards for generated documents.
* **Test Cases:**  Detailed test cases for all aspects of the RGA (unit, integration, system, user acceptance).
* **Test Reports:** Documents the results of testing activities.
* **PMBOK Documents:** The generated project management documentation (e.g., Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, etc.).
* **Bug Tracking System:** A system for tracking and managing identified defects.

**6. Quality Control Activities**

* **Code Reviews:**  Regular code reviews will be conducted to identify potential defects early in the development process.
* **Unit Testing:** Developers will write unit tests to verify the functionality of individual code modules.
* **Integration Testing:**  Testing will verify the interaction between different components of the system.
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete RGA system.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by end-users to validate that the system meets their requirements.

**7. Quality Assurance Activities**

* **Quality Audits:** Periodic audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the quality management system.
* **Process Improvement:**  Continuous improvement initiatives will be implemented to enhance the quality management processes.
* **Compliance Reviews:** Regular reviews to ensure adherence to PMBOK standards and other relevant regulations.

**8. Quality Improvement Approaches**

* **Defect Prevention:**  Proactive measures will be taken to prevent defects from occurring, such as code reviews and thorough testing.
* **Root Cause Analysis:**  When defects are discovered, root cause analysis will be conducted to identify the underlying causes and prevent recurrence.
* **Lessons Learned:**  Lessons learned from each iteration will be documented and used to improve future processes.

**9. Quality Tools and Techniques**

* **Test Management Software:**  Used to manage and track test cases, test execution, and defects.  (e.g., Jira, TestRail)
* **Code Coverage Tools:**  Used to measure the percentage of code that is covered by unit tests.
* **Static Code Analysis Tools:**  Used to identify potential defects in the code without executing it. (e.g., ESLint)
* **Performance Testing Tools:**  Used to measure the performance of the RGA under different loads. (e.g., JMeter)
* **Root Cause Analysis Techniques:**  (e.g., 5 Whys, Fishbone diagrams)


**10. Quality Metrics and Acceptance Criteria**

* **Defect Density:**  The number of defects per 1000 lines of code.  Target: < 2 defects/1000 lines.
* **Test Coverage:**  The percentage of code covered by unit tests. Target: > 80%.
* **Test Pass Rate:** The percentage of test cases that pass. Target: > 95%.
* **Document Accuracy:** Measured by comparing key data points in generated documents to manually created equivalents.  Target: >98% accuracy.
* **UAT Acceptance Rate:** The percentage of UAT test cases that pass.  Target: 100%.
* **PMBOK Compliance Score:**  A score based on a checklist of PMBOK 7th Edition requirements for each generated document.  Target: 100%.

**11. Quality Documentation Requirements**

All quality-related documentation (this QMP, coding standards, test plans, test reports, etc.) will be maintained in a central repository accessible to all project stakeholders.

**12. Verification and Validation Approach**

Verification will focus on ensuring that the RGA meets its specified requirements.  Validation will focus on ensuring that the RGA meets the needs of its users.  Both will be accomplished through various testing stages (unit, integration, system, UAT).

**13. Testing Strategy and Procedures**

The testing strategy will employ a combination of unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.  A detailed test plan will be created outlining the specific test cases, test data, and expected results for each test level.

**14. Quality Control Checklists**

Checklists will be developed for each phase of the development lifecycle to ensure that all necessary quality control activities are performed.  These checklists will be included in the project's process assets.
