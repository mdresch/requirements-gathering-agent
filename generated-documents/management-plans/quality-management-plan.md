# Quality Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose of the Plan  
The **Quality Management Plan** outlines the processes, standards, responsibilities, and procedures to ensure the Requirements Gathering Agent project meets its quality objectives. This plan is designed to guarantee the delivery of a reliable, PMBOK-compliant AI-powered tool that automates project documentation generation, enhances user satisfaction, and meets stakeholder expectations.  

The purpose of this plan is to define the framework for quality assurance (QA), quality control (QC), and continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle while adhering to PMBOK standards.  

---

## 2. Quality Standards to Be Used  
The projectâ€™s quality standards are based on the following:  
- **PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines** for project management documentation and compliance.  
- **ISO 25010** software quality model for functional suitability, reliability, usability, and maintainability.  
- **TypeScript and Node.js coding standards** for software development quality.  
- **Azure OpenAI API guidelines** for AI integration and security.  
- **Industry best practices** for CLI tools and user experience.  

---

## 3. Quality Objectives  
The following objectives define the scope of quality for this project:  
1. Ensure all generated documents are **PMBOK-compliant** with validated structure and content.  
2. Achieve and maintain a **document quality score of 90/100** or higher.  
3. Guarantee cross-document consistency with **100% traceability** of requirements, objectives, and deliverables.  
4. Ensure the CLI tool is **user-friendly** with error-free execution and intuitive commands.  
5. Deliver a system with **99.9% uptime reliability**, robust failover mechanisms, and efficient resource utilization.  
6. Maintain compliance with Azure OpenAI API security standards and enterprise authentication protocols (e.g., Entra ID).

## 4. Quality Roles and Responsibilities  
### Project Team  
- **Project Manager**: Oversees the implementation of the Quality Management Plan, monitors quality metrics, and approves corrective actions.  
- **Quality Assurance Lead**: Ensures adherence to quality standards, performs audits, and manages documentation validation.  
- **Development Team**: Implements the system according to coding standards and performs unit tests.  
- **Testing Team**: Conducts integration, system, and acceptance testing; verifies compliance with quality objectives.  
- **Stakeholders**: Provides feedback on quality deliverables and ensures alignment with requirements.  

---

## 5. Quality Deliverables and Processes  
### Deliverables  
- PMBOK-compliant management plans (e.g., Scope Management Plan, Quality Management Plan).  
- Generated project documentation (e.g., stakeholder register, risk management plan, WBS).  
- CLI tool with interactive AI provider selection and error handling mechanisms.  
- Validation reports for compliance with PMBOK standards.  

### Processes  
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Validate completeness and accuracy of functional and non-functional requirements.  
2. **Design Validation**: Ensure architecture meets scalability, maintainability, and performance criteria.  
3. **Code Review**: Conduct peer reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards.  
4. **Testing and Validation**: Perform quality control checks and acceptance testing before delivery.  
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Implement lessons learned and feedback loops to improve quality processes.  

---

## 6. Quality Control Activities  
Quality control ensures deliverables meet predefined standards and acceptance criteria. Activities include:  
- **Document Validation**: Validate generated documents against PMBOK standards using automated checks and manual reviews.  
- **Code Quality Checks**: Use code linting tools (e.g., ESLint) to ensure coding standards are followed.  
- **Functional Testing**: Verify CLI functionality for accurate document generation and error handling.  
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure seamless integration with Azure OpenAI APIs and other AI providers.  
- **Performance Testing**: Measure system efficiency and resource utilization under load.  

---

## 7. Quality Assurance Activities  
Quality assurance ensures processes are followed to achieve project objectives. Activities include:  
- **Quality Audits**: Perform periodic audits to ensure processes align with the Quality Management Plan.  
- **PMBOK Compliance Validation**: Use automated tools to validate document content and structure against PMBOK standards.  
- **Documentation Reviews**: Conduct detailed reviews of generated documentation for completeness and accuracy.  
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Gather feedback to ensure deliverables meet user expectations.  

---

## 8. Quality Improvement Approaches  
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** pipelines for automated testing and deployment.  
- **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate user and stakeholder feedback into development cycles.  
- **Lessons Learned**: Document lessons learned during each phase to improve future processes.  
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigate defects to identify and address underlying issues.  

---

## 9. Quality Tools and Techniques
