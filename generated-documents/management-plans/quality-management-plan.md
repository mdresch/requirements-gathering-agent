# Quality Management Plan  
**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Prepared by:** [ADPA Project Team](https://github.com/mdresch/requirements-gathering-agent)

## 1. Introduction

The Quality Management Plan (QMP) defines the approach, processes, standards, and responsibilities for achieving and assuring quality in the ADPA Enterprise Framework project. ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript automation platform for enterprise requirements, project, and data management, supporting industry standards such as BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. The QMP ensures all deliverables—software, documentation, and integrations—meet specified requirements and stakeholder expectations, and comply with regulatory and enterprise standards.

---

## 2. Quality Objectives

- **Compliance**: Ensure automation outputs and workflows are aligned with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7, DMBOK 2.0, and applicable financial and data privacy regulations (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.).
- **Reliability & Stability**: Deliver a robust framework capable of operating in production at scale (Fortune 500 readiness).
- **Usability**: Provide intuitive CLI, REST API, and admin web interfaces for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Security**: Achieve enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Extensibility & Maintainability**: Facilitate easy integration of new AI providers, document templates, and enterprise systems.
- **Performance**: Meet or exceed defined response times and throughput SLAs for document processing and API endpoints.
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain >90% code coverage for core modules with automated unit, integration, and performance tests.

---

## 3. Quality Standards and Methodologies

ADPA adheres to the following standards and best practices:

- **Software Engineering**: Strict TypeScript, ESLint (Airbnb), Prettier, Conventional Commits, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Project & Business Analysis**: PMBOK 7th Edition, BABOK v3, DMBOK 2.0 frameworks.
- **API Design**: OpenAPI 3.0, TypeSpec, Swagger UI.
- **Testing**: Jest for unit/integration, automated test scripts for all supported providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
- **Documentation**: Markdown, GitHub Wiki, and in-code comments; automated doc generation for APIs.
- **Security**: OWASP Top 10, Helmet middleware, rate limiting, CORS, JWT & API Key authentication.
- **Compliance**: Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, ISO 9001.
- **Enterprise Integration**: Follows Microsoft, Atlassian, Adobe, and other vendor best practices.

## 5. Quality Assurance Processes

### 5.1. Requirements Quality

- **Traceability**: All requirements are tracked from specification to implementation and test coverage.
- **Validation**: Business analysts review generated documentation for alignment with BABOK/PMBOK/DMBOK.
- **Templates**: All document generation templates are peer-reviewed and tested for compliance.

### 5.2. Development Quality

- **Coding Standards**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier enforced pre-commit via CI.
- **Peer Review**: All code changes require pull request reviews and sign-off.
- **Automated Builds**: All code is built and tested automatically on CI (GitHub Actions or equivalent).

### 5.3. Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Jest for all core modules, with minimum 90% coverage.
- **Integration Testing**: Automated scripts for API endpoints, AI provider integrations, and enterprise connectors.
- **Performance Testing**: Automated scripts (e.g., npm run test:performance) to measure response times and throughput.
- **Security Testing**: Use of automated tools (e.g., dependency scanning, static analysis), review of authentication/authorization flows, and regular penetration testing.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Business users and analysts validate usability and standards compliance of outputs.
- **Regression Testing**: Automated regression tests run on every major release.

### 5.4. Release Management

- **Pre-Release Checks**: All tests must pass; code must meet coverage and documentation standards.
- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning; pre-release versions for major new features.
- **Documentation**: Release notes, API docs, and user guides updated for every release.

---

## 6. Quality Control Measures

- **Static Code Analysis**: Automated checks for code quality (lint, types, formatting) on every commit.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated build and test pipeline on every pull request and push.
- **Manual Code Reviews**: Required for all merges to main branch.
- **Automated API Validation**: OpenAPI/TypeSpec contracts are validated and tested for all endpoints.
- **Template Validation**: Document templates are validated for required fields, structure, and compliance.
- **Monitoring & Logging**: Production APIs and services are continuously monitored (health checks, logging, error tracking) with alerts for failures or anomalies.
- **Feedback Loops**: Bug/issue tracking on GitHub Issues; feedback reviewed in regular project meetings.

---

## 7. Tools and Infrastructure

- **Development**: TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest, ts-jest, automated scripts for AI provider and integration testing
- **API**: TypeSpec, OpenAPI 3.0, Swagger UI, Redocly for API docs
- **Security**: Helmet, express-rate-limit, CORS, bcryptjs, express-validator
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, npm scripts, Docker (future)
- **Monitoring**: Winston, express-winston, morgan; production health endpoints
- **Documentation**: Markdown, GitHub Wiki, auto-generated API docs
- **Enterprise Integration**: @adobe/pdfservices-node-sdk, @azure/msal-node, @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client, etc.

---

## 8. Compliance & Regulatory Quality

- **Framework Alignment**: All generated outputs are validated for compliance to target standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Ed., DMBOK 2.0).
- **Data Privacy**: Adherence to GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and other relevant regulations.
- **Audit Trails**: All document generation, publishing, and editing activities are logged and traceable.
- **Enterprise Security**: Supports SSO (OAuth2, SAML), Active Directory, and role-based access control.

---

## 9. Documentation & Knowledge Management

- **Comprehensive Docs**: All user, developer, and API documentation must be up-to-date, versioned, and accessible via the GitHub Wiki.
- **Template & Integration Guides**: Step-by-step guides for configuring providers, setting up integrations (Adobe, SharePoint, Confluence), and using CLI/API.
- **Release Notes**: Detailed notes for every release, highlighting features, bug fixes, known issues, and upgrade instructions.

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

- **Metrics & KPIs**: Track test pass rates, code coverage, performance benchmarks, customer satisfaction, and production incident rates.
- **Retrospectives**: Conduct regular sprint/project reviews to identify and implement quality improvements.
- **Training**: Ongoing training for team members on compliance, security, and best practices.
- **Customer Feedback**: Proactively seek and incorporate feedback from enterprise users and open-source contributors.

---

## 11. Risk Management

- **Quality Risks**: Identified risks (e.g., AI provider outages, integration failures, standards misalignment) are tracked and mitigated through redundancy, robust error handling, and regular audits.
- **Change Management**: All changes are reviewed for quality impact and tested in isolated environments before production deployment.

---

## 12. Approval and Maintenance

This QMP is reviewed and approved by the Project Manager and QA Lead at project inception and before every major release. It is a living document and will be updated as the project, technologies, or quality requirements evolve.
