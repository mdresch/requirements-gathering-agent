# Quality Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Purpose

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the processes, procedures, and standards for ensuring the quality of the ADPA project and its deliverables.  The plan adheres to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines and leverages the project's built-in quality assurance features, including PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and automated quality assessment.

## 2. Quality Policy

The ADPA project is committed to delivering high-quality, reliable, and PMBOK-compliant documentation.  Our quality policy prioritizes:

* **Accuracy:** Ensuring the generated documents are factually correct and consistent with the provided project context.
* **Completeness:** Delivering comprehensive documentation that addresses all relevant aspects of the project.
* **Compliance:** Adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards and any other relevant regulatory or organizational requirements.
* **Usability:** Creating clear, concise, and easily understandable documents for the target audience.
* **Timeliness:** Delivering documentation according to the project schedule.

## 3. Quality Objectives

* Achieve a PMBOK compliance score of 95% or higher for all generated documents.
* Maintain an average document quality score of 90% or higher (as assessed by the built-in quality assessment feature).
* Achieve 100% stakeholder acceptance of the generated documents.
* Identify and resolve all critical quality issues within 24 hours of detection.

## 4. Quality Assurance and Control

The ADPA project incorporates several quality assurance and control mechanisms:

**4.1 Automated Quality Assessment:** The project leverages its built-in quality assessment feature to analyze generated documents based on factors such as structure, content, PMBOK terminology usage, and completeness.  This automated assessment provides detailed scores and recommendations for improvement.  Results are included in the validation reports for each document generation.

**4.2 PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** The `--validate-pmbok` and `--generate-with-validation` CLI options enable automated validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards. This ensures adherence to best practices and minimizes compliance risks.  Detailed compliance reports are generated, highlighting areas for improvement.

**4.3 Manual Review and Sign-off:**  While the automated tools provide a significant level of quality assurance, manual review by project stakeholders is crucial.  Key stakeholders will review a sample of generated documents to ensure accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the project context.  Formal sign-off will be required for key deliverables.

**4.4 Continuous Improvement:**  The project will maintain a record of quality issues, their root causes, and implemented corrective actions.  This information will be used to improve the quality management processes and the performance of the automated tools over time.  Regular reviews of the QMP will be conducted to adapt to project changes and advancements in AI technology.

**4.5 Version Control:**  The integrated version control system (VCS) allows for tracking of all changes made to generated documents, enabling easy rollback to previous versions if needed.  This ensures traceability and facilitates quality control.

## 5. Metrics and Reporting

The following metrics will be tracked and reported:

* **PMBOK Compliance Score:**  The percentage of PMBOK requirements met for each document.
* **Document Quality Score:** The overall quality score assigned by the automated assessment tool.
* **Number of Quality Issues:** The total number of identified quality issues.
* **Time to Resolve Quality Issues:** The time taken to resolve quality issues.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction:**  Feedback from stakeholders on the quality of the generated documents.

Reports will be generated after each major document generation cycle and will be shared with the project team and stakeholders.

## 6. Responsibility and Authority

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for ensuring the quality of the project and its deliverables.
* **Technical Lead:** Responsible for the quality of the code and the performance of the automated quality assurance tools.
* **Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing and approving the generated documents.

## 7. Quality Improvement Process

Any identified quality issues will be documented, analyzed to determine root cause, and addressed through corrective and preventive actions.  Lessons learned will be incorporated into the QMP and the automated quality assurance tools to prevent similar issues from recurring.  This continuous improvement process will enhance the overall quality of the project deliverables and the quality management system itself.


## 8. Appendix

This section may include:

* Detailed descriptions of the automated quality assessment metrics.
* Templates for quality issue reporting and resolution.
* Records of quality issues, root causes, and corrective actions.
* Stakeholder feedback on document quality.


This Quality Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in project scope, requirements, or best practices.
