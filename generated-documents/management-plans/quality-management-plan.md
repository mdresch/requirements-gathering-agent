# Quality Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the quality management plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, version 2.2.0.  The RGA is a crucial tool for automating PMBOK-compliant documentation generation, leveraging AI and multiple provider integrations.  Given the project's aim for international use within the banking industry,  strict adherence to quality standards and regulatory compliance is paramount. This plan details the processes and procedures to ensure the delivered software meets these high standards.

**2. Quality Objectives**

The primary quality objectives for the RGA project are:

* **Functional Correctness:** The RGA must accurately and reliably generate PMBOK-compliant documents as specified in the requirements documents (`02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`).  This includes accurate data transformation, consistent formatting, and adherence to specified templates.
* **Performance:** The RGA must generate documents efficiently, within acceptable timeframes defined in the performance testing plan (implied from `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`).  This includes minimizing latency and resource consumption.
* **Security:** While explicitly excluded from the `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, secure handling of API keys and sensitive data during interactions with AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) is critical. Robust error handling and input validation are essential to prevent vulnerabilities.  This will require a separate security review and penetration testing.
* **Usability:** The CLI interface (`cli.ts` and `cli-main.ts`) must be intuitive and user-friendly. Clear error messages and comprehensive documentation (`IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE-PROVIDER-CHOICE-MENU.MD`, `SHAREPOINT-USAGE-GUIDE.MD`, etc.) are essential.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase must be well-structured, documented (`ARCHITECTURE.MD`), and easy to maintain and extend.  Adherence to coding standards and use of appropriate design patterns are vital.
* **Compliance:**  The software must comply with all relevant banking regulations and legislation (as stated in the project README).  This will require ongoing monitoring and updates to ensure continued compliance.

**3. Quality Assurance Activities**

The following quality assurance activities will be implemented:

* **Requirements Review:** Thorough review of functional and non-functional requirements to ensure clarity, completeness, and testability.
* **Design Review:**  Review of the system architecture (`ARCHITECTURE.MD`) and design to identify potential flaws and ensure adherence to best practices.
* **Code Review:** Peer code review to identify bugs, improve code quality, and ensure adherence to coding standards.
* **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive unit testing of individual components to ensure functional correctness. (Covered by `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD` and implied by `ARCHITECTURE.MD`'s mention of Jest.)
* **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different components to ensure seamless integration. (Covered by `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`)
* **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete system to validate all functionalities and non-functional requirements. (Covered by `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`)
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Testing by end-users to validate usability and meet user expectations.
* **Performance Testing:** Testing to ensure the system meets performance requirements. (Implied from `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`)
* **Security Testing:**  Penetration testing and security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance Testing:**  Regular testing to ensure adherence to all relevant regulations and legislation.
* **Documentation Review:** Review of all documentation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and clarity.


**4. Quality Metrics**

The following metrics will be tracked to monitor the quality of the software:

* **Defect Density:** Number of defects found per lines of code.
* **Test Coverage:** Percentage of code covered by unit and integration tests.
* **Defect Resolution Time:** Time taken to resolve defects.
* **Customer Satisfaction:** Feedback from users on usability and functionality.
* **Compliance Audit Results:** Results of compliance audits.


**5. Tools and Technologies**

* **Testing Framework:** Jest (as indicated in project metadata)
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Issue Tracking:** (Specify tool used for issue/bug tracking)
* **Documentation Tools:** (Specify tools used for documentation)


**6. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Development Team:** Responsible for writing high-quality code, conducting unit and integration testing, and participating in code reviews.
* **QA Team:** Responsible for conducting system testing, UAT, performance testing, security testing, and compliance testing.
* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overseeing the quality management process and ensuring that all quality objectives are met.


**7.  Defect Management Process**

All defects discovered during any phase of testing will be logged in the designated issue tracking system.  The defect report should include:

* Defect ID
* Description
* Severity
* Priority
* Steps to Reproduce
* Expected Result
* Actual Result
* Assigned Developer
* Status


**8.  Change Management**

Any changes to the requirements or design will be documented and reviewed using a formal change management process to ensure that the impact on quality is assessed and mitigated.


**9.  Quality Audits**

Regular quality audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of the quality management process and identify areas for improvement.


This Quality Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The specific details of testing and compliance will be further elaborated in separate, more detailed plans.  The lack of explicit security requirements in the initial documentation necessitates a separate, comprehensive security plan to be developed and integrated into this overall quality management strategy.
