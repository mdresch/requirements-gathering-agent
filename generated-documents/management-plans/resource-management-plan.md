# Resource Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Resource Management Plan (RMP) outlines the strategies and procedures for acquiring, allocating, managing, and releasing resources required for the successful completion of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This plan adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and considers the project's unique needs, including the utilization of AI and a geographically dispersed team (implied by the project's global reach).

```

**4. Resource Acquisition Approach**

* **Internal Resources:** The core development team (Lead Developer, AI Specialist, Documentation Specialist, QA/Tester) will be sourced internally.  Their time allocation will be managed using a time-tracking system.
* **External Resources:**  No external resources are currently anticipated, but this may change based on project needs and unforeseen complexities.  If required, external resources will be acquired through a formal procurement process, including defining requirements, sourcing vendors, and negotiating contracts.

**5. Resource Breakdown Structure (RBS)**

This RBS outlines the resources needed categorized by role and type:

```

**6. Resource Calendars**

Individual resource calendars will be maintained using a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana, Microsoft Project) to track availability and allocation.  These calendars will be regularly updated to reflect changes in resource availability or task assignments.

**7. Training Needs**

* **AI Specialist:** Training on specific AI models (Gemini, GPT-4) and Azure OpenAI APIs might be required.
* **Team:** Training on PMBOK methodologies and the project management tool being used may be beneficial.  Training will be identified and scheduled as needed.

**8. Team Development Approach**

A collaborative and agile approach will be employed, fostering open communication, regular team meetings, and knowledge sharing.  Regular feedback sessions and code reviews will be implemented to ensure high-quality development.

**9. Recognition and Rewards Strategy**

Recognition for individual and team achievements will be provided through verbal acknowledgment, team celebrations, and performance reviews.  Specific rewards will be determined based on project success and budget.

**10. Compliance Requirements**

All resources and activities must comply with relevant organizational policies, legal regulations, and data privacy standards.

**11. Safety Considerations**

The primary safety concern is the responsible use of AI tools and adherence to ethical guidelines.  Data security and privacy will be prioritized throughout the development and deployment phases.

**12. Resource Control Procedures**

Resource allocation and utilization will be monitored regularly using the project management tool.  Any deviations from the plan will be addressed through change management processes.

**13. Resource Release Plan**

Upon project completion, resources will be released according to the project closure plan.  This includes the return of any borrowed equipment, the archiving of project documentation, and the formal release of team members back to their regular assignments.


This Resource Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in resource availability, project scope, or risks.  Regular monitoring and control will ensure that resources are used effectively and efficiently to achieve project objectives.
