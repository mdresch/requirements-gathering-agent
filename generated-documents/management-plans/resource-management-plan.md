# Resource Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This Resource Management Plan outlines the approach for identifying, acquiring, managing, and releasing resources required for the successful completion of the ADPA project.  The plan focuses on efficient resource allocation, considering the project's unique AI-driven nature and rapid development cycles.

## 2. Resource Identification

The ADPA project requires a diverse range of resources, categorized as follows:

**2.1 Human Resources:**

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project planning, execution, and monitoring.  (1 FTE, Menno Drescher)
* **Software Developers (Frontend, Backend):** Responsible for development, testing, and maintenance of the ADPA application. (2 FTEs, to be determined)
* **AI/ML Specialist:** Responsible for AI model selection, integration, prompt engineering, and performance optimization. (0.5 FTE, to be determined)
* **Technical Writer:** Responsible for creating and maintaining documentation. (0.5 FTE, potentially outsourced)
* **QA/Tester:** Responsible for testing, validation, and quality assurance of the generated documents and application. (0.5 FTE, potentially outsourced)


**2.2 Material Resources:**

* **Software Licenses:**  Azure OpenAI, Google AI (optional), GitHub Copilot (optional), Ollama (optional), Node.js, TypeScript, testing frameworks, etc. (Costs to be determined based on usage and provider selection)
* **Hardware:** Development machines for the team (costs covered by existing infrastructure)
* **Cloud Computing Resources:** Azure cloud services for AI model execution (costs to be determined based on usage)


**2.3 Financial Resources:**

* Budget allocated for software licenses, cloud computing resources, potential outsourcing of technical writing and QA. (To be determined from the Business Case)


## 3. Resource Acquisition

* **Internal Resources:**  The Project Manager is already assigned.  Software Developers and AI/ML specialists will be recruited internally or through a contracting agency.
* **External Resources:** Technical writing and QA testing may be outsourced to specialized agencies based on project needs and budget constraints.


## 4. Resource Allocation

Resource allocation will be managed using a combination of techniques:

* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  Tasks will be assigned to specific team members based on their skills and expertise.
* **Project Schedule:**  The project schedule will be used to track resource availability and ensure timely completion of tasks.
* **Resource Leveling:**  The project schedule will be reviewed regularly to identify and address potential resource conflicts.
* **Resource Smoothing:**  Tasks may be adjusted within their slack time to optimize resource utilization.


## 5. Resource Leveling and Smoothing

The project will utilize a hybrid approach for managing resource allocation:

* **Leveling:**  This will be the primary approach to ensure critical path tasks have the necessary resources, even if it means delaying non-critical tasks.
* **Smoothing:** Where possible, the schedule will be adjusted to smooth out resource demands without impacting the project completion date.  This will be done with an iterative approach, continuously monitoring resource utilization.


## 6. Resource Control

* **Regular Monitoring:**  Resource allocation and utilization will be monitored weekly through project status meetings and progress reports.
* **Performance Reporting:**  Individual and team performance will be assessed to identify areas for improvement and address potential resource issues.
* **Change Management:**  Any changes to resource requirements will be documented and approved through the established change management process.


## 7. Resource Release

Upon project completion, all resources will be released according to the project closure plan, including:

* **Human Resources:** Team members will be reassigned to other projects.
* **Material Resources:**  Software licenses will be managed according to their respective agreements.  Cloud computing resources will be decommissioned.


## 8. Risk Management

Potential risks related to resource management include:

* **Resource Shortages:**  Mitigation:  Proactive recruitment, flexible resource allocation, and contingency planning.
* **Skill Gaps:** Mitigation:  Training, mentoring, and outsourcing.
* **Budget Overruns:** Mitigation:  Careful budget planning, regular monitoring, and cost control measures.


## 9. Communication Plan

Regular communication regarding resource allocation and availability will be maintained using the following channels:

* **Weekly Project Meetings:**  All team members will attend weekly meetings to discuss resource availability, progress, and any potential issues.
* **Project Management Software:**  A project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana) will be used to track resource assignments and progress.
* **Email and Instant Messaging:**  For quick updates and communication between team members.


## 10.  Resource Calendar

*(A detailed resource calendar will be created and maintained within the chosen project management software.  This calendar will show the allocation of resources to specific tasks over time.)*


This Resource Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that resources are utilized effectively and efficiently.  Any significant changes to the plan will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.
