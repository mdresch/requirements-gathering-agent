# Resource Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Resource Management Plan outlines the approach for acquiring, allocating, managing, and releasing resources required for the successful completion of the ADPA project.  Given the project's innovative use of AI and its rapid development cycle, flexibility and efficient resource utilization are paramount.

**2. Project Resources**

The ADPA project requires a diverse range of resources, categorized as follows:

**2.1 Human Resources:**

| Role                     | Resource Type      | Quantity | Skillset                                                                 | Availability   |
|--------------------------|----------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Lead Developer            | Full-time Employee   | 1        | TypeScript, Node.js, Azure OpenAI API, Git, Agile methodologies              | Full-time       |
| AI/ML Engineer           | Full-time Employee   | 1        | Large Language Models (LLMs), Prompt Engineering, Model Optimization,  Python | Full-time       |
| Software Tester           | Full-time Employee   | 1        | Software testing methodologies, Test automation, CI/CD                      | Part-time (20 hrs/week)|
| Technical Writer         | Contractor           | 1        | Technical writing, Markdown, PMBOK documentation standards                   | As-needed       |
| Project Manager          | Full-time Employee   | 1        | PMBOK, Agile methodologies, Risk management, Stakeholder management          | Part-time (10 hrs/week)|


**2.2 Material Resources:**

* **Software Licenses:**  Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot (if applicable), other relevant AI/ML tools.  Licenses will be procured through existing organizational agreements.
* **Hardware:**  Development workstations with sufficient processing power and memory.  Access to cloud computing resources (Azure) will be leveraged as needed.
* **Infrastructure:** Azure cloud services (compute, storage) for development, testing, and deployment.  Existing infrastructure will be utilized wherever possible.


**2.3 Financial Resources:**

The financial resources required will be tracked using the project's budget, allocated across various categories (personnel costs, software licenses, cloud services, etc.).  Regular budget reviews will be conducted to ensure alignment with project progress and to identify any potential cost overruns.  A contingency budget of 15% is allocated to address unforeseen expenses.


**3. Resource Acquisition**

* **Internal Resources:**  Human resources will be allocated from existing team members and will be managed through standard organizational processes.
* **External Resources:** The technical writer will be hired as a contractor, using a standard RFP process.  Software licenses will be procured through existing organizational agreements.

**4. Resource Allocation**

Resource allocation will be managed using a combination of Agile methodologies (sprints, task assignments) and a centralized project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana).  The Project Manager will be responsible for ensuring that resources are allocated effectively to meet project milestones and deadlines.  A RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) will be used to clarify roles and responsibilities.

**5. Resource Leveling and Smoothing**

Resource leveling and smoothing techniques will be applied to optimize resource utilization and prevent resource conflicts.  This will involve analyzing resource demands across different project phases and adjusting task schedules as needed.

**6. Resource Monitoring and Control**

Resource performance will be monitored regularly using the project management tool, tracking progress against individual tasks and milestones.  Regular status meetings will be held to identify and address any resource-related issues.  Time sheets will be utilized to accurately track time spent on project tasks.

**7. Resource Release**

Upon project completion, all resources (human, material, and financial) will be released according to organizational procedures.  A post-project review will be conducted to evaluate resource utilization and identify areas for improvement in future projects.

**8. Risk Management**

Potential risks related to resource management include:

* **Resource Availability:**  Insufficient availability of skilled personnel or hardware resources.  Mitigation: Proactive recruitment, resource leveling, and outsourcing options.
* **Resource Conflicts:**  Overlapping resource demands across different tasks or projects.  Mitigation: Resource leveling, prioritization, and clear communication.
* **Cost Overruns:**  Unexpected increases in resource costs.  Mitigation: Regular budget reviews, contingency planning, and value engineering.

**9. Communication Plan**

Regular communication will be maintained among the project team, stakeholders, and management.  This will involve daily stand-up meetings, weekly status reports, and monthly progress reviews.  A dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) will be used to facilitate efficient communication.

This Resource Management Plan is a living document and will be updated as needed to reflect changes in project scope, schedule, or resource availability.
