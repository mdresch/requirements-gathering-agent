# Resource Management Plan: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the resource management plan for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automating the monthly backup process and ensuring secure recovery.  The project aims to improve the reliability and efficiency of backups, minimizing downtime in case of system failure.  The plan addresses resource needs, allocation, and management throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Project Overview**

Project Backup Vermigerous automates monthly backups and validates the integrity of project data. Backups are categorized by year and month to facilitate efficient retrieval.  The goal is to maintain sufficient backup data to enable rapid and complete restoration after any system failure.

**3. Resources Required**

This project requires the following resources:

* **Personnel:**
    * **System Administrator (1 FTE):** Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the automated backup system.  This includes scripting, configuration, testing, and monitoring.  Requires expertise in scripting (PowerShell, Bash, etc.), cloud storage (Azure Blob Storage preferred), and backup technologies.
    * **Database Administrator (0.5 FTE):**  Required for database backup and recovery procedures, ensuring database integrity and optimal backup strategies.  This role may overlap with the System Administrator if the database is relatively small.
    * **Project Manager (0.2 FTE):**  Oversees the project timeline, resource allocation, and risk management.
* **Hardware:**  Minimal additional hardware is anticipated.  Existing server infrastructure will likely suffice.  Requirements depend on the size of the data being backed up.  Consideration may be given to additional storage capacity based on backup retention policies.
* **Software:**
    * **Azure Subscription:** Required for Azure Blob Storage and potentially Azure Automation.
    * **Backup Software (if applicable):**  If a third-party backup solution is used, licensing and support costs need to be factored in.
    * **Monitoring Tools:** Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, or similar tools for monitoring backup success and alerting on failures.
    * **Scripting Languages:** PowerShell (preferred), Bash, or Python for automation scripts.
* **Infrastructure:**
    * **Azure Blob Storage:**  Provides secure, scalable, and cost-effective storage for backups.  Consider using a WORM (Write Once Read Many) storage tier for immutability and enhanced security.
    * **Network Connectivity:** Reliable network connectivity is crucial for automated backups and data transfer.

**4. Resource Allocation**

The following table outlines the resource allocation:

| Resource Type        | Resource Name          | Allocation (FTE/Hours) | Start Date | End Date   |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-------------|------------|
| Personnel            | System Administrator   | 1 FTE                  | 2024-10-28 | 2025-01-28 |
| Personnel            | Database Administrator | 0.5 FTE                | 2024-10-28 | 2025-01-28 |
| Personnel            | Project Manager        | 0.2 FTE                | 2024-10-28 | 2025-01-28 |
| Software             | Azure Subscription     | As needed              | 2024-10-28 | 2025-01-28 |
| Infrastructure       | Azure Blob Storage     | As needed              | 2024-10-28 | 2025-01-28 |


**5. Resource Management**

* **Tracking:**  Progress will be tracked using a project management tool (e.g., Azure DevOps, Jira) to monitor task completion and resource utilization.
* **Communication:** Regular team meetings will ensure effective communication and coordination among team members.
* **Risk Management:**  Potential risks, such as network outages or storage capacity limitations, will be identified and mitigation strategies developed.
* **Contingency Planning:**  A contingency plan will be in place to address unexpected issues, such as hardware failures or software bugs.


**6. Budget**

The budget will include costs associated with Azure services (storage, automation), software licenses (if applicable), and personnel costs.  A detailed budget breakdown will be provided in a separate document.

**7. Resource Calendar**

A detailed resource calendar will be maintained to visualize resource allocation and availability throughout the project lifecycle. This calendar will be updated regularly to reflect any changes in the project plan.

**8.  Resource Acquisition**

* **Internal Resources:**  System Administrator and Database Administrator will be sourced internally.
* **External Resources:**  If specialized skills are needed, external consultants may be engaged.
* **Software/Cloud Services:**  Azure subscription will be utilized.


**9.  Resource Release**

Upon project completion, resources will be released according to the project timeline.  The System Administrator will ensure the automated backup system is properly documented and handed over to the relevant team for ongoing maintenance.


This Resource Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.
