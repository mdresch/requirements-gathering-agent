## Scope Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the approach for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  It details how the project scope will be defined, validated, controlled, and monitored throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring alignment with the project charter and stakeholder expectations while adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.

**2. Scope Management Processes**

The project will utilize the following scope management processes:

* **2.1 Plan Scope Management:** This process defines how the project scope will be managed.  This includes defining the scope baseline, WBS, and scope management activities.  The plan will consider the iterative nature of the project and incorporate mechanisms for change management.

* **2.2 Define Scope:** This process creates a detailed description of the project and product scope, including deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.  This will be based on the project's README, requirements documents, stakeholder input, and the PMBOK 7th Edition knowledge areas.

* **2.3 Create WBS:**  A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be developed to decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable components.  This will facilitate better task assignment, progress tracking, and cost estimation. The WBS will be hierarchical, reflecting the project's structure as shown in the project's `generated-documents` directory structure.

* **2.4 Validate Scope:**  This process formally accepts the defined scope with stakeholders.  This will involve regular reviews and sign-offs at key milestones to ensure alignment and address any discrepancies.  This will be facilitated through milestone reports (e.g., MILESTONE-175-DOWNLOADS.md) and stakeholder feedback mechanisms.

* **2.5 Control Scope:** This process manages changes to the project scope.  A formal change control process will be implemented, including change requests, impact assessments, approvals, and updates to the project documentation. This process will be crucial in managing the evolution of the RGA based on user feedback and new feature requests.

**3. Scope Baseline**

The scope baseline will consist of the following:

* **Project Scope Statement:** A formal document describing the project's objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.  This will be generated using the RGA itself, drawing from the existing README and other documentation.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project work into smaller, manageable components.
* **WBS Dictionary:** A description of each component in the WBS, including details on deliverables, activities, and resources.
* **Requirements Documentation:**  Comprehensive documentation of functional and non-functional requirements, derived from the project's README and other requirements documents.  The RGA's own enhanced project analysis will be instrumental in ensuring this is comprehensive.

**4. Scope Change Control Process**

The following process will be used to manage scope changes:

1. **Change Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit a formal change request describing the proposed change, its rationale, and impact.
2. **Impact Assessment:** The project team assesses the impact of the proposed change on schedule, cost, and resources.
3. **Change Approval:** The change request is reviewed and approved by the appropriate stakeholders.
4. **Scope Baseline Update:** The scope baseline is updated to reflect the approved changes.
5. **Implementation:** The approved changes are implemented.
6. **Verification:** The implemented changes are verified to ensure they meet the requirements.

**5. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used to manage the project scope:

* **Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA):**  The core tool for generating and managing project documentation.  Its built-in PMBOK validation features will ensure compliance.
* **Project Management Software:**  A project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana) will be used to track tasks, progress, and issues.
* **Version Control System (Git):**  Used for managing changes to the project's codebase and documentation.
* **Regular Stakeholder Meetings:**  Meetings will be held to review progress, address issues, and manage scope changes.


**6. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall scope management, including planning, execution, and control.
* **Stakeholders:** Responsible for providing input, reviewing deliverables, and approving scope changes.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the approved scope and managing technical aspects.


**7. Reporting and Monitoring**

Progress against the scope baseline will be monitored regularly. Reports will be generated to track progress, identify potential issues, and manage scope changes. These reports will leverage the RGA's reporting capabilities and will be shared with stakeholders.


**8.  Contingency Planning**

The plan will include contingency measures to address unforeseen challenges, including a process for managing unexpected requirements or changes in stakeholder priorities. This will involve revisiting the scope change control process and potentially adjusting the project's priorities to reflect the new situation.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.  The iterative nature of the RGA development means this plan will be a living document, adapting to the project's evolving needs.
