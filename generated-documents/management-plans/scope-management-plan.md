## Scope Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction:**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the approach for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensuring alignment with project objectives, stakeholder expectations, and PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The plan addresses scope definition, verification, and control throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Scope Management Processes:**

This project will utilize the following scope management processes from PMBOK 7th Edition:

* **1.1 Plan Scope Management:** Defining how the project scope will be managed.
* **1.2 Define Scope:** Creating a detailed description of the project and product scope.
* **1.3 Create WBS:** Decomposing the project scope into smaller, manageable components.
* **1.4 Collect Requirements:** Determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and requirements.
* **1.5 Define Activities:** Identifying the specific tasks required to deliver each WBS component.
* **1.6 Validate Scope:** Formally accepting the completed deliverables.
* **1.7 Control Scope:** Managing changes to the project scope.

**3. Plan Scope Management:**

This section details the processes and procedures for managing the project scope.

* **3.1 Scope Management Plan:** This document itself serves as the Scope Management Plan.
* **3.2 Scope Baseline:** The approved project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary will form the scope baseline.  Any changes to the baseline will be managed through a formal change control process.
* **3.3 Scope Change Control System:**  A formal change control process will be implemented, including a change request form, review process, and approval authority.  Changes will be documented, assessed for impact, and approved/rejected based on their impact on the schedule, budget, and quality.
* **3.4 Tools and Techniques:**  The project will utilize project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana) to track scope, requirements, and changes.  Regular meetings and communication will be used to keep stakeholders informed.
* **3.5 Roles and Responsibilities:** The Project Manager will be responsible for overall scope management.  Developers will be responsible for delivering the technical components within the defined scope.  Stakeholders will review and approve the scope.


**4. Define Scope:**

This involves creating a detailed description of the project and product scope.  The project scope includes:

* **Project Deliverables:**  A fully functional Requirements Gathering Agent application, including the CLI, the core document generation engine, the enhanced context manager, and support for multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  This also includes comprehensive documentation (user guide, API documentation, etc.).  A project kickoff checklist will be included as a new deliverable.
* **Project Exclusions:**  Integration with third-party project management tools (beyond basic JSON output), support for non-markdown document formats (in initial release), and extensive customization of generated documents beyond existing CLI options are excluded from the initial scope.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** The application will meet the defined functional and non-functional requirements, pass all unit and integration tests, and receive formal acceptance from stakeholders.  PMBOK 7th edition compliance will be validated.

**5. Create WBS:**

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be created to decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable tasks.  The WBS will be organized hierarchically, with each level representing a progressively more detailed breakdown of the work.  The WBS will be regularly updated to reflect changes in scope.  A WBS dictionary will be created to provide detailed descriptions of each WBS component.

**6. Collect Requirements:**

Requirements will be collected from various stakeholders through a combination of methods, including:

* **Review of Existing Documentation:**  The project README and associated files will be the primary source of requirements.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Discussions with stakeholders will be conducted to clarify requirements and identify any missing information.
* **Requirement Workshops:**  Collaborative sessions to finalize and validate requirements.

**7. Define Activities:**

Based on the WBS, a detailed list of activities will be defined, including estimated durations and dependencies.

**8. Validate Scope:**

At the completion of each major phase, the scope will be validated with stakeholders to ensure that the deliverables meet their expectations.  This will involve formal reviews and sign-offs.

**9. Control Scope:**

A formal change control process will be used to manage any changes to the project scope.  All change requests will be documented, reviewed, and approved or rejected based on their impact on the project.


**10.  Metrics and Reporting:**

The following metrics will be tracked and reported regularly:

* **Scope Baseline Changes:** Number and impact of changes to the scope baseline.
* **Change Request Processing Time:** Time taken to process and approve/reject change requests.
* **Requirement Traceability:** Tracking of requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Scope Creep:**  Monitoring for any uncontrolled expansion of the project scope.

This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.
