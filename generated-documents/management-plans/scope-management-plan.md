## Scope Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction:**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines and ensures that all necessary work is included, while preventing scope creep.  The plan addresses scope definition, validation, and control throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Scope Management Approach:**

The project will employ an iterative approach to scope management, incorporating feedback from stakeholders at each stage.  This will involve:

* **Requirements Elicitation:** Gathering detailed functional and non-functional requirements from various sources (README.md, project documentation, stakeholder interviews).
* **Scope Definition:** Creating a comprehensive project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary, clearly defining deliverables and acceptance criteria.
* **Scope Validation:** Obtaining formal approval of the project scope from key stakeholders.
* **Scope Control:** Implementing a change management process to manage and control any proposed changes to the project scope.  This will include a Change Control Board (CCB) to review and approve/reject change requests.
* **Scope Verification:** Regularly verifying that the work performed meets the defined scope throughout the project lifecycle.

**3. Scope Definition Process:**

**3.1 Inputs:**

* Project Charter: Defines high-level objectives, constraints, and assumptions.
* Project README: Provides initial project description and features.
* Existing Project Documentation (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.):  Provides detailed information about the project's functionality and architecture.
* Stakeholder Interviews and Workshops:  Gather additional requirements and feedback from stakeholders.
* PMBOK Guide 7th Edition:  Provides standards and best practices for scope management.

**3.2 Activities:**

* **Analyze Project Documentation:**  Thoroughly review all existing project documentation to identify features, functionalities, and constraints.
* **Conduct Stakeholder Interviews/Workshops:**  Gather requirements and clarifications from stakeholders (developers, project managers, business analysts).
* **Develop Project Scope Statement:** Create a formal document defining the project's objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.
* **Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decompose the project into smaller, manageable work packages.
* **Develop WBS Dictionary:**  Provide detailed descriptions for each work package in the WBS, including deliverables, resources, and timelines.
* **Define Acceptance Criteria:**  Establish clear and measurable criteria for accepting each deliverable.
* **Document Scope Baseline:**  Formalize the approved scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary as the project baseline.

**3.3 Outputs:**

* Project Scope Statement
* Approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
* WBS Dictionary
* Acceptance Criteria
* Scope Baseline

**4. Scope Validation Process:**

**4.1 Inputs:**

* Project Scope Statement
* WBS
* WBS Dictionary
* Acceptance Criteria

**4.2 Activities:**

* **Formal Review:**  Present the scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary to key stakeholders for review and approval.
* **Stakeholder Feedback:**  Gather feedback and address any concerns or ambiguities.
* **Revisions:**  Incorporate feedback and make necessary revisions to the scope documentation.
* **Formal Approval:** Obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders to approve the final scope baseline.

**4.3 Outputs:**

* Approved Project Scope Statement
* Approved WBS
* Approved WBS Dictionary
* Approved Acceptance Criteria
* Signed-off Scope Baseline

**5. Scope Control Process:**

**5.1 Inputs:**

* Scope Baseline
* Change Requests
* Performance Reports
* Project Management Plan

**5.2 Activities:**

* **Change Request Management:**  Establish a formal process for submitting, reviewing, approving/rejecting, and implementing changes to the project scope. This includes a Change Control Board (CCB) with defined roles and responsibilities.
* **CCB Review:** The CCB reviews all change requests, assessing their impact on scope, schedule, cost, and risk.
* **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the impact of proposed changes on the project.
* **Change Implementation:**  Implement approved changes, updating the project documentation and baseline as needed.
* **Scope Change Control:** Track and manage all approved and rejected scope changes.

**5.3 Outputs:**

* Change Log
* Updated Scope Baseline (if changes approved)
* Rejected Change Requests

**6. Scope Verification Process:**

**6.1 Inputs:**

* Work Performance Data
* Deliverables
* Acceptance Criteria

**6.2 Activities:**

* **Inspection and Testing:**  Verify that the completed work packages meet the defined acceptance criteria.
* **Formal Acceptance:**  Obtain formal acceptance of deliverables from stakeholders.
* **Issue Resolution:**  Address any issues or discrepancies discovered during verification.

**6.3 Outputs:**

* Verified Deliverables
* Acceptance Documents
* Issue Log (if applicable)

**7. Tools and Techniques:**

* Microsoft Project or similar project management software
* Collaborative workspaces (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint)
* Change management software

**8. Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:**  Overall responsibility for scope management.
* **CCB:**  Reviews and approves/rejects change requests.
* **Stakeholders:**  Provide input and approval for the scope baseline and changes.

**9. Reporting:**

Regular progress reports will include scope status, change requests, and verification results.  These reports will be communicated to stakeholders according to the Communication Management Plan.


This Scope Management Plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.
