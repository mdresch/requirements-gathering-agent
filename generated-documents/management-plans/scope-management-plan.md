# Scope Management Plan  

## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

### 1. **Introduction**  

This Scope Management Plan outlines the approach for managing the project scope for the **Requirements Gathering Agent**. The purpose of this document is to ensure that all the required work (and only the required work) is completed for the successful delivery of the project, which aligns with PMBOK standards. This plan defines how scope will be identified, documented, validated, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle to avoid scope creep and ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations.

---

### 2. **Scope Management Approach**  

The scope of the project will be managed through a structured process involving requirements gathering, scope definition, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) development, scope validation, and ongoing scope control. The project scope will leverage AI-based tools for iterative stakeholder engagement, ensuring traceability to objectives and compliance with PMBOK standards.  

#### Key Activities:  
- Documenting stakeholder requirements and expectations.  
- Defining project deliverables, boundaries, and constraints.  
- Developing the WBS and WBS dictionary to structure project work.  
- Validating deliverables with stakeholders to ensure alignment.  
- Controlling scope changes through a formal change management process.  

---

### 3. **Scope Definition Process**  

#### **3.1 Inputs**  
The following resources and documentation will be utilized to define the scope:  
- **Project Charter**: High-level scope, objectives, and constraints.  
- **Stakeholder Register**: Identification of stakeholder needs and expectations.  
- **Requirements Documentation**: Functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Organizational Process Assets**: Templates, lessons learned, historical data.  
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors**: Industry standards, regulations, tools, and technologies.  

#### **3.2 Activities**  
- **Requirements Elicitation**: Conduct workshops and interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.  
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define project deliverables, features, and boundaries.  
- **In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Identification**: Explicitly document what is included and excluded from the project.  
- **Acceptance Criteria Definition**: Establish criteria for the acceptance of project deliverables.  

#### **3.3 Outputs**  
- **Scope Statement**: Comprehensive description of project scope, including deliverables, boundaries, and constraints.  
- **WBS and WBS Dictionary**: Hierarchical decomposition of project work and detailed descriptions of each work package.  
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix**: Ensures alignment of requirements with project deliverables.  

---

### 4. **Roles and Responsibilities**  

#### **4.1 Roles**  
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Responsible for overall scope management and approval of changes.  
- **Business Analysts (BA)**: Document detailed requirements and perform traceability analysis.  
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input and validate deliverables.  
- **Development Team**: Implement project deliverables as per the defined scope.  

#### **4.2 Responsibilities**  
- Ensuring stakeholder needs are captured and prioritized.  
- Verifying scope alignment with PMBOK standards.  
- Validating deliverables against acceptance criteria.  
- Communicating scope changes effectively to all stakeholders.  

---

### 5. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  

#### **5.1 WBS Development**  
The WBS will be developed using the projectâ€™s scope statement and requirements documentation to ensure a structured breakdown of all deliverables.  

#### **5.2 WBS Dictionary**  
Each work package in the WBS will be described in detail, including:  
- Description of work.  
- Assigned resources.  
- Estimated timelines.  
- Dependencies and constraints.  

---

### 6. **Scope Validation**  

Scope validation will involve regular reviews with stakeholders to ensure deliverables meet defined acceptance criteria. Formal acceptance will be documented for each deliverable to establish alignment with stakeholder expectations.  

#### **Validation Methods:**  
- Stakeholder workshops and demonstrations.  
- Quality assurance reviews.  
- Formal approval sign-offs.  

---

### 7. **Scope Control**  

#### **7.1 Change Control Process**  
A formal change control process will be implemented to manage scope changes. All changes must be:  
- **Documented**: Change requests must be clearly described and justified.  
- **Evaluated**: Impact analysis on schedule, cost, and quality must be conducted.  
- **Approved**: Changes must be approved by the Change Control Board (CCB) before implementation.  

#### **7.2 Tools and Techniques**  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent**: AI-powered analysis for managing requirements and scope changes.  
- **Scope Creep Prevention**: Regular scope reviews and stakeholder engagement to identify deviations early.  
- **Traceability Matrix**: Ensures all changes are aligned with project goals and requirements.  

---

### 8. **Deliverables**  

#### **8.1 Key Deliverables**  
The following outputs will be created and delivered as part of the project scope:  
- Comprehensive PMBOK-compliant documentation, including the Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, and Scope Management Plan.  
- Requirements Traceability Matrix.  
- Work Breakdown Structure and WBS Dictionary.  
- AI-driven tools for automated document generation and validation.  

#### **8.2 Exclusions**  
The following items are explicitly excluded from the scope:  
- Development of additional AI features not specified in the requirements.  
- Integration with third-party project management tools beyond the defined scope.  
- Support for AI models other than those currently supported (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama).  

---

### 9. **Assumptions and Constraints**  

#### **9.1 Assumptions**  
- Stakeholders will actively participate in requirements gathering and scope validation activities.  
- All necessary resources (e.g., Azure OpenAI subscription, TypeScript development environment) will be available.  
- The project team will adhere to PMBOK standards throughout the project lifecycle.  

#### **9.2 Constraints**  
- The project must comply with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  
- Budget and schedule limitations may restrict scope expansion.  
- AI model context size limitations may impact document generation.  

---

### 10. **Performance Metrics and Reporting**  

#### **10.1 Metrics**  
- **Scope Adherence**: Percentage of deliverables completed without scope changes.  
- **Change Requests**: Number of change requests approved/rejected.  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Survey results post-deliverable validation.  

#### **10.2 Reporting**  
Scope-related metrics will be reported weekly in the project status report, including:  
- Scope validation results.  
- Approved change requests and their impact.  
- Remaining deliverables and work packages.  

---

### 11. **Review and Approval**  

This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and approved by the Project Manager, the Change Control Board, and key stakeholders. Any updates to the plan will follow the formal change control process.  

#### **Approval Signatures:**
