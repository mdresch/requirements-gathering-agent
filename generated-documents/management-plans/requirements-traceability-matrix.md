# Requirement Traceability Matrix - Project Backup Vermigerous

**Project:** Project Backup Vermigerous

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


This matrix traces requirements from the project description and design choices to implementation details.  Due to the limited detail in the provided project description, some assumptions have been made.  This matrix should be expanded upon as the project progresses and more specific requirements are defined.


| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Type | Priority | Source Document | Design Choice(s) Addressed | Status | Verification Method | Implemented By | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-1 | Automated monthly backup of project data. | Functional | High | PROJECT README | 1. Automated Backup Scheduling | In Progress | Successful cron job execution, backup file verification | Dev Team | Requires definition of "project data" and backup storage location. |
| REQ-2 | Backup validation to ensure data integrity. | Functional | High | PROJECT README | 3. Validation & Integrity Checks | In Progress | Checksum verification, successful restore test in sandbox | Dev Team | Requires specification of checksum algorithm (SHA-256 suggested). |
| REQ-3 | Sufficient backup data for restoration after system failure. | Functional | High | PROJECT README | 2. Incremental & Differential Backups, 4. Secure Storage Architecture | In Progress | Successful restoration test from various backup points | Dev Team | Requires definition of "sufficient" in terms of Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO). |
| REQ-4 | Monthly backups categorized by year and month. | Functional | High | PROJECT README | 5. Metadata Tagging & Categorization | In Progress | Verification of file naming convention and metadata | Dev Team | Requires definition of file naming convention. |
| REQ-5 | Secure storage of backups. | Non-Functional | High | PROJECT README | 4. Secure Storage Architecture | In Progress | Security audit, encryption key management review | Security Team | Requires specification of encryption algorithm (AES-256 suggested) and storage location (Azure Blob Storage suggested).  Consider multi-region replication for disaster recovery. |
| REQ-6 | Automated recovery testing. | Non-Functional | High | PROJECT README | 6. Automated Recovery Testing | Planned | Successful restore tests logged in a test environment | Dev Team | Requires definition of testing frequency and scope. |
| REQ-7 | Monitoring and alerting for backup failures and delays. | Non-Functional | High | PROJECT README | 7. Monitoring & Alerting | Planned | Review of monitoring dashboards and alert configurations | DevOps Team | Requires integration with a monitoring system (Azure Monitor suggested).  Define alert thresholds. |
| REQ-8 | Incremental or differential backups to optimize storage space and time. | Non-Functional | Medium | PROJECT README | 2. Incremental & Differential Backups | Planned | Comparison of full vs. incremental/differential backup sizes and times | Dev Team | Requires analysis to determine the optimal strategy based on data change rates. |


**Legend:**

* **Requirement ID:** Unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Requirement Description:** Clear and concise description of the requirement.
* **Type:** Functional or Non-Functional.
* **Priority:** High, Medium, or Low.
* **Source Document:** Document where the requirement originated.
* **Design Choice(s) Addressed:** Design choices that address the requirement.
* **Status:**  Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Verified.
* **Verification Method:** How the requirement will be verified.
* **Implemented By:** Team or individual responsible for implementation.
* **Notes:** Additional information or clarifications.


This matrix will be updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in requirements and implementation progress.  Further refinement is necessary to fully capture all aspects of the project's requirements and their traceability.
