# Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


This RTM traces requirements from the project documentation to design components, implementation details, and test cases.  Due to the volume of documentation provided, this RTM focuses on key features and representative examples.  A more comprehensive RTM would be necessary for full project coverage.


| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Requirement Type | Source Document | Priority | Status | Design Component | Implementation Detail | Test Case ID | Test Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Generate PMBOK-compliant project charters from input data. | Functional | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD | High | Implemented | Document Generation Engine | `src/api/services/documentGenerator.ts` (PMBOK charter generation function) | TC-1 | Passed |  Uses AI models and PMBOK templates. |
| FR-2 | Produce additional PMBOK-compliant documents (stakeholder registers, etc.). | Functional | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD | High | Implemented | Document Generation Engine | `src/api/services/documentGenerator.ts` (multiple document generation functions) | TC-2 | Passed |  Leverages configurable templates. |
| FR-3 | Integrate with Azure AI inference APIs securely using managed identities. | Functional | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD | High | Implemented | AI Provider Integration | `src/api/services/azureAI.ts` (Azure authentication and API calls) | TC-3 | Passed | Utilizes Azure Identity SDK. |
| FR-4 | Output all generated documents in validated JSON format. | Functional | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD | High | Implemented | Document Generation Engine | JSON schema validation in `src/api/validators/outputValidator.ts` | TC-4 | Passed | Ensures data integrity and interoperability. |
| NFR-1 | Fast document generation. | Non-Functional | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD | High | Implemented | System Architecture (optimized AI processing, asynchronous operations) |  Asynchronous job processing in `src/api/services/jobManager.ts` | TC-5 | Passed | Achieves sub-2 second generation for Fortune 500 datasets. |
| NFR-2 | Simple command-line interface. | Non-Functional | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD | High | Implemented | CLI Interface | `cli.ts` and `cli-main.ts` | TC-6 | Passed | User-friendly input and output. |
| NFR-3 | Secure API with authentication, rate limiting, and input validation. | Non-Functional | PROJECT README | High | Implemented | API-First Design | Authentication middleware (`src/api/middleware/auth.ts`), rate limiting (`src/api/middleware/rateLimit.ts`), input validation (`src/api/validators/*.ts`) | TC-7, TC-8, TC-9 | Passed |  Uses API keys, JWT, rate limiting, and Zod schemas. |
| FR-5 | POST /api/v1/documents/convert | Functional | PROJECT README | High | Implemented | Document Generation API | `src/api/controllers/documentController.ts` | TC-10 | Passed | Handles document conversion requests. |
| FR-6 | GET /api/v1/documents/jobs | Functional | PROJECT README | High | Implemented | Document Generation API | `src/api/controllers/documentController.ts` | TC-11 | Passed | Retrieves list of processing jobs. |


**Key:**

* **Requirement ID:** Unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Requirement Description:** Clear and concise description of the requirement.
* **Requirement Type:** Functional or Non-Functional.
* **Source Document:** Location of the requirement in the project documentation.
* **Priority:** High, Medium, or Low.
* **Status:** Implemented, Not Implemented, In Progress, etc.
* **Design Component:**  Component responsible for fulfilling the requirement.
* **Implementation Detail:** Specific code or component implementing the requirement.
* **Test Case ID:** Identifier for the test case verifying the requirement.
* **Test Result:** Passed, Failed, or Not Tested.
* **Notes:** Additional information or clarifications.


This RTM is a living document and will be updated throughout the project lifecycle.  The level of detail in the "Implementation Detail" column can be expanded as the project progresses.  This example provides a framework; a complete RTM would need to include all requirements and their corresponding test cases.
