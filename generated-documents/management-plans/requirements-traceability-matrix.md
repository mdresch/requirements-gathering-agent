# Requirement Traceability Matrix

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

This matrix traces requirements from various sources (planning documents, testing summaries, architecture documentation) to ensure complete coverage and consistency.  Due to the incomplete nature of the provided source documents (many are truncated), this matrix reflects only the requirements that could be fully extracted.  A complete matrix would require access to the full documentation.

**Legend:**

* **Req ID:** Requirement Identifier
* **Requirement Type:** Functional (FR), Non-Functional (NFR), Constraint (C)
* **Requirement Description:** Concise description of the requirement.
* **Source Document:** Document where the requirement is initially defined.
* **Test Case ID (TCID):**  Identifier for test cases verifying the requirement (if available from provided documentation).
* **Status:** Implemented (Imp), Not Implemented (NI), In Progress (IP), Not Applicable (NA)
* **Notes:** Any additional comments or explanations.


| Req ID | Requirement Type | Requirement Description | Source Document | Test Case ID (TCID) | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | FR | Automatically generate PMBOK-compliant project charters from input data. | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp | Assumes successful integration with AI providers and template engine. |
| FR-2 | FR | Produce additional PMBOK-compliant documents (stakeholder registers, scope management plans, etc.). | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp |  Assumes successful integration with AI providers and template engine. |
| FR-3 | FR | Integrate with Azure AI inference APIs securely using managed identities (Azure Identity SDK). | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp |  Successful integration confirmed by API testing (partial data available). |
| FR-4 | FR | Output all generated documents strictly in validated JSON format. | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp |  Successful JSON output validation assumed based on testing summary (partial data).|
| FR-5 | FR | Provide a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for users to invoke the module and manage configurations. | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp | CLI functionality assumed based on project metadata (available scripts). |
| FR-6 | FR | Perform schema validation on generated outputs to ensure data integrity and PMBOK compliance. | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp |  Successful schema validation assumed based on testing summary (partial data). |
| FR-7 | FR | Support a modular architecture to allow future extensions and integration with third-party project management tools. | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | Imp |  Modular architecture described in ARCHITECTURE.MD. |
| FR-8 | FR | Provide user documentation, tutorials, and training materials. | 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD |  | IP |  Documentation partially available (e.g., SHAREPOINT-USAGE-GUIDE.MD, BABOK-ENTERPRISE-DEMONSTRATION-GUIDE.MD).  Further documentation likely needed. |
| FR-9 | FR | Generate PMBOK-compliant documents | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Overlaps with FR-1 and FR-2. |
| FR-10 | FR | Support multiple AI providers | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Multiple AI provider support is mentioned in ARCHITECTURE.MD and partially confirmed by API testing. |
| FR-11 | FR | CLI interface for ease of use | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Overlaps with FR-5. |
| FR-12 | FR | Template-based document creation | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Template-based generation is mentioned in ARCHITECTURE.MD and partially confirmed by API testing. |
| FR-13 | FR | Simple file output management | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Assumed based on overall functionality. |
| NFR-1 | NFR | Fast document generation | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | IP | Performance testing results are needed for full assessment. |
| NFR-2 | NFR | Simple command-line interface | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Assumed based on available CLI scripts. |
| NFR-3 | NFR | Clean, modular code | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | Imp |  Assumed based on project architecture and use of TypeScript. |
| NFR-4 | NFR | Plugin architecture for extensibility | PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD |  | IP |  Extensibility is mentioned in ARCHITECTURE.MD, but implementation status needs further verification. |


**Note:**  Many requirements are implicitly present in the provided documents but lack explicit statements and identifiers.  This matrix represents a partial traceability based on the available, complete information.  A thorough review of the full project documentation is necessary for a comprehensive requirement traceability matrix.
