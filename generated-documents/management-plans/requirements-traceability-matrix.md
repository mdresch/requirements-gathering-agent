## Key Notes  

1. **Requirement Types**:  
   - **Functional**: Defines what the system must do.  
   - **Non-functional**: Specifies system qualities (e.g., performance, scalability).  
   - **Business**: Aligns with organizational and stakeholder objectives.  

2. **Priority Levels**:  
   - **High**: Critical for project success; must be implemented.  
   - **Medium**: Important but can be deferred or adjusted if necessary.  

3. **Verification Methods**:  
   - **System Testing**: Validate the systemâ€™s behavior against requirements.  
   - **Document Validation**: Check generated artifacts for compliance and accuracy.  
   - **Stakeholder Feedback**: Ensure user satisfaction and alignment with needs.  
   - **Performance Testing**: Validate non-functional requirements like scalability and speed.  

4. **Status Definitions**:  
   - **Not Started**: Requirement is documented but not yet implemented.  
   - **In Progress**: Requirement is actively being implemented or tested.  
   - **Completed**: Requirement has been implemented and verified successfully.
