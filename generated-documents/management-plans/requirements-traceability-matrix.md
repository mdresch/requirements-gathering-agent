## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) - Requirements Gathering Agent

This RTM traces requirements from their source through to verification.  It uses a simplified approach for brevity, but in a real-world scenario,  more detailed test cases and verification methods would be included.

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                                                                        | Requirement Type | Priority | Source                     | Success Criteria                                                                   | Test Case Reference | Verification Method | Status |

**Key:**

* **TC-XXX:** Refers to a specific test case documented elsewhere.
* **Inspection:** Visual check of the output.
* **Review:** Formal review by stakeholders or experts.
* **Integration Test:** Testing the interaction between different components.
* **Error Injection Test:** Deliberately introducing errors to test system resilience.
* **Data Validation:** Checking the correctness and completeness of the data.
* **Schema Validation:** Validating JSON output against a predefined schema.
* **Usability Testing:** Assessing user-friendliness and ease of use.
* **Performance Testing:** Measuring the speed and efficiency of the system.
* **Git Check:** Verifying the presence and integrity of the Git repository and commits.


This RTM provides a skeletal framework. A complete RTM for a real-world project would be significantly larger and more detailed, with specific test cases, detailed success criteria, and comprehensive status updates for all requirements.  The "Source" column could also specify the page number or section within a document for enhanced traceability.
