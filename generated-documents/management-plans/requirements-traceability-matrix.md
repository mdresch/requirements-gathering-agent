# Requirement Traceability Matrix - ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

This document traces requirements from the project's high-level objectives and features down to specific design and implementation details.  It facilitates impact analysis, change management, and verification throughout the project lifecycle.


| Requirement ID | Requirement Description | Type | Priority | Source Document | Status | Design/Implementation Details | Verification Method | Test Case ID | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-1 | Generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation. | Functional | High | Project Charter | Implemented | Uses PMBOK 7.0 templates and validation rules.  Leverages AI to populate templates based on project context. | Automated testing, manual review against PMBOK standards. | TEST-PMBOK-1 | Includes 29 document types. |
| REQ-2 | Support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama). | Non-Functional | High | README, Configuration Section | Implemented | Modular architecture allows for easy integration with different AI providers via configuration.  Fallback mechanisms handle provider failures. | Unit tests for each provider integration, integration tests covering provider switching. | TEST-PROVIDER-1, TEST-PROVIDER-2, TEST-PROVIDER-3, TEST-PROVIDER-4 | Fallback mechanisms ensure functionality even if a primary provider is unavailable. |
| REQ-3 |  Automatically discover and analyze project documentation (beyond README). | Functional | High | README, Enhanced Project Analysis Section | Implemented | Uses intelligent file discovery algorithms (recursive search, relevance scoring, categorization). | Automated testing with various sample project structures. | TEST-ANALYSIS-1 | Analyzes markdown files for relevance based on PMBOK terminology, location, and naming patterns. |
| REQ-4 |  Provide an Enhanced Context Manager for improved AI performance. | Non-Functional | High | README, Enhanced Context Manager Section | Implemented | Three-phase context strategy adapts to different AI model capabilities (core, ultra-large, supplementary). | Performance testing with different AI models and context sizes.  Context utilization reports. | TEST-CONTEXT-1, TEST-CONTEXT-2 | Achieves 25-75x improvement in context utilization. |
| REQ-5 |  Generate executive-ready strategic documents (e.g., Purpose Statement, Company Values). | Functional | Medium | README, Business Communication Translator System Section | Implemented | Uses AI to generate authentic and context-aware strategic statements. | Manual review for professional quality and alignment with project goals. | TEST-STRATEGIC-1 | Output should be indistinguishable from human-written documents. |
| REQ-6 |  Include a complete technical design document generation system. | Functional | High | README, Technical Design Document System Section | Implemented | 10 specialized processors generate different technical design documents (architecture, system design, database schema, etc.). | Automated testing of each processor, manual review for completeness and accuracy. | TEST-TECH-DESIGN-1...TEST-TECH-DESIGN-10 | Each processor uses document-specific AI prompts. |
| REQ-7 |  Implement a built-in version control system (VCS) for generated documents. | Non-Functional | Medium | README, Version Control System Section | Implemented | Uses a local Git repository to track changes in the `generated-documents` folder.  CLI commands for managing VCS. | Automated testing of VCS commands, manual verification of commit history and diffs. | TEST-VCS-1 | Auto-commits after each document generation. |
| REQ-8 |  Ensure PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation. | Non-Functional | High | README, Validation & Quality Assurance Section | Implemented | Automated checks for required elements, terminology, and consistency across documents.  Generates compliance reports. | Automated testing, manual review of validation reports. | TEST-PMBOK-VALIDATION-1 | Reports include quality scores and recommendations for improvement. |
| REQ-9 |  Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for easy use. | Non-Functional | High | README, Command Line Options Section | Implemented |  Comprehensive CLI with options for generating specific documents, validating, controlling context, and managing VCS. | Manual testing of all CLI commands. | TEST-CLI-1 | Supports batch processing and configuration management. |
| REQ-10 |  Maintain a modular architecture for extensibility. | Non-Functional | Medium | README, Modular Processor Architecture Section | Implemented | Uses a processor factory to manage document generation, allowing for easy addition of new document types. | Unit tests for modular components, integration tests for adding new processors. | TEST-MODULARITY-1 |  New document types can be added without modifying core code. |


**Legend:**

* **Requirement ID:** Unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Requirement Description:** Clear and concise description of the requirement.
* **Type:** Functional or Non-Functional.
* **Priority:** High, Medium, or Low.
* **Source Document:** Document where the requirement is originally defined.
* **Status:** Implemented, In Progress, Not Started, Deferred, etc.
* **Design/Implementation Details:** Description of how the requirement is addressed in the design and implementation.
