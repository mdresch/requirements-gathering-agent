# Requirement Traceability Matrix

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

This matrix traces requirements from the project README and other documentation to specific features and design elements within the ADPA system.  It uses a simplified format for brevity, but can be expanded for more detailed traceability.
