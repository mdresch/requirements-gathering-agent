# Scope Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  
Aligned with PMBOK 7th Edition Standards  

---

## 1. Purpose of the Scope Management Plan  
The purpose of this Scope Management Plan is to define how the project scope for the Requirements Gathering Agent will be developed, validated, managed, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle. This plan ensures alignment with stakeholder expectations, organizational policies, compliance with PMBOK standards, and delivery of the project objectives within agreed constraints.  

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach  

The scope will be managed through the following key activities:  

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Detailed elicitation and documentation of stakeholder requirements using workshops, interviews, and PMBOK-compliant templates.  
2. **Scope Definition**: Clear identification of in-scope and out-of-scope items based on requirements and project charter inputs.  
3. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Development of a structured WBS and WBS Dictionary to break down deliverables into manageable components.  
4. **Scope Validation**: Formal approval of scope deliverables by stakeholders to ensure alignment with expectations.  
5. **Scope Control**: Continuous monitoring and management of scope changes through the Change Control process to prevent scope creep.
