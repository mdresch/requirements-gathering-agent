## Plan Scope Management for Requirements Gathering Agent

This plan outlines how scope will be managed for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The plan leverages the existing project documentation and README extensively.

**1. Project Scope Definition:**

* **Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation based on project context extracted from various sources (primarily README and associated markdown files).
* **Deliverables:**  The primary deliverable is a functional, tested, and documented Requirements Gathering Agent application (npm package) capable of generating all specified PMBOK documents (as listed in the README). Secondary deliverables include comprehensive user documentation, testing reports, and a deployment package.
* **Scope Inclusions:**  All features listed in the README, including comprehensive project analysis, enhanced context management, multiple AI provider support, PMBOK 7.0 validation, and the generation of all documented PMBOK document types.  The tool will handle various project structures (as detailed in the README).
* **Scope Exclusions:**  Integration with specific third-party project management tools beyond the core AI providers (this can be future scope). Support for file types beyond markdown (this can be future scope).  Development of custom AI models.


**2. Scope Management Plan:**

* **Scope Baseline:** The approved project scope statement (to be created based on the information above and potentially incorporating further refinement from stakeholder input).  This will serve as the primary reference point for scope control.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** An RTM will be created to link requirements (functional and non-functional, extracted from the README and other documents) to specific deliverables and verification methods. The README provides a good starting point for requirement identification.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A WBS will be developed to decompose the project into manageable work packages. The existing documentation provides a good starting point, which can be organized into phases (e.g., Requirements Gathering, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Documentation).
* **Change Management Process:** A formal change management process will be implemented, including a change request form, review process, impact assessment, and approval authority.  The process will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.  All changes will be recorded and tracked in a change log.
* **Scope Verification:**  Formal reviews (e.g., walkthroughs, inspections) will be conducted at key milestones (e.g., completion of major development phases, before release) to verify that the work performed conforms to the scope baseline.  Stakeholder input will be actively sought during these reviews.
* **Scope Control:**  Regular monitoring of progress against the scope baseline will be performed.  Variance analysis will identify and address any deviations from the planned scope.  The change management process will be used to handle any necessary scope changes.
* **Tools and Techniques:**  The project will utilize project management software (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) for task management, issue tracking, and change control.  The existing markdown files, including the README, will be used as crucial inputs.
* **Stakeholder Engagement:**  Regular communication with stakeholders (developers, testers, PMO, and end-users) will be maintained to ensure alignment on scope and to address any concerns or issues.


**3. Scope Statement:**

A formal Project Scope Statement will be created based on the information above.  This statement will be reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders before project commencement.  It will include:

* **Project Objectives:** Clearly defined goals of the project.
* **Project Deliverables:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) deliverables.
* **Project Scope:**  Detailed description of the work included and excluded.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Conditions that must be met for each deliverable to be considered complete and acceptable.
* **Project Boundaries:**  Clear definition of the limits of the project.
* **Assumptions and Constraints:**  Factors that could impact the project's scope.


**4.  Risk Management Related to Scope:**

* **Scope Creep:**  A significant risk.  Mitigation strategies include: rigorous change control, regular scope reviews, clear definition of scope, and proactive communication with stakeholders.
* **Requirements Volatility:** Another significant risk. Mitigation strategies include: frequent stakeholder communication, iterative development, and a flexible approach to requirements management.


**5.  Metrics and Reporting:**

* **Scope Change Requests:**  Number of change requests submitted and approved.
* **Scope Variance:**  Difference between planned and actual scope.
* **Completion Percentage:**  Percentage of planned scope completed.
* **Defect Rate:**  Number of defects found in the deliverables.


This plan will be iteratively refined throughout the project lifecycle based on feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned.  The existing documentation, especially the README, will be used as a living document to inform and update this plan.
