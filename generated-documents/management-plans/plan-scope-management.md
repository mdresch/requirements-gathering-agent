## Plan Scope Management for Requirements Gathering Agent

This Plan Scope Management document outlines the approach for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan considers the project's unique aspects, including its AI-powered nature and the extensive documentation already available.

**1. Project Scope Statement:**

The project scope is to develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documentation from various project sources, including but not limited to README files, markdown documents, and project configuration files. The tool will support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), offer comprehensive validation features, and include a user-friendly command-line interface.  The project's deliverables include the functional software, comprehensive documentation (user guides, API documentation, etc.), and a detailed test plan with associated test results.  The project scope *excludes* the development of a graphical user interface (GUI) or integration with specific third-party project management tools beyond basic file system interaction.

**2. Scope Baseline:**

The scope baseline will be established upon approval of this Scope Management Plan and the Project Scope Statement.  It will consist of the approved Project Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and the associated WBS dictionary.  Any changes to the scope baseline will be formally documented and managed through a change control process (detailed below).

**3. Scope Management Processes:**

* **3.1 Planning Scope Management:** This involves defining how the project scope will be managed throughout the project lifecycle.  This plan itself is the primary output of this process.  Key aspects include:
    * **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix will be created to track requirements from their origin (e.g., user stories, project charter) through to their implementation in the software and documentation.  The existing project README and related markdown files will be a primary source for requirements.
    * **Scope Definition:** The project scope is defined in detail in the Project Scope Statement above.
    * **WBS Development:** A WBS will be created to decompose the project into manageable work packages. This will leverage the existing modular architecture and existing documentation (e.g.,  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`,  `docs/STEPS-TO-IMPLEMENT-NEW-DOCS.md`) to inform the structure.
    * **WBS Dictionary:** A WBS dictionary will provide detailed descriptions of each work package, including estimated effort and dependencies.
    * **Scope Verification:**  This process will involve regular reviews of the WBS and WBS dictionary to ensure alignment with the project scope statement and stakeholder expectations.

* **3.2 Defining Scope:** This process involves creating a detailed project scope statement, which has been largely completed above.  The key aspect here is refining the existing description and ensuring consensus among stakeholders.

* **3.3 Creating the WBS:**  As mentioned above, the WBS will be a hierarchical decomposition of the project work, informed by the existing modular architecture and documentation.

* **3.4 Validating Scope:** This will involve regular reviews of the project scope with stakeholders to ensure continued alignment. This includes both formal reviews and informal feedback mechanisms.

* **3.5 Controlling Scope:** This process involves managing changes to the project scope.  This will be done through a formal change control process:
    * **Change Request Process:** All requests for scope changes will be submitted in writing, including a justification, impact assessment, and proposed solution.
    * **Change Control Board (CCB):** A CCB will review all change requests and approve or reject them based on pre-defined criteria.
    * **Change Management Documentation:** All change requests, decisions, and implementations will be formally documented.
    * **Regular Monitoring:** The project scope will be regularly monitored for any deviations from the baseline.

**4. Tools and Techniques:**

* **Project Management Software:** A project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana, Microsoft Project) will be used to track progress, manage tasks, and facilitate communication.
* **Version Control:** Git will be used for code management and documentation versioning.
* **Collaboration Tools:**  Slack or Microsoft Teams will be used for communication and collaboration.
* **Requirements Management Tool:** A requirements management tool may be considered to further enhance traceability and facilitate change management.

**5. Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall scope management and change control.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing the software and adhering to the defined scope.
* **Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing and approving the scope baseline and change requests.

**6. Communication Plan:**

Regular meetings (weekly or bi-weekly) will be held with stakeholders to review progress, address issues, and manage scope changes.  Progress reports will be distributed regularly.  A communication matrix will be created to define communication channels and responsibilities.

**7. Risk Management:**

Risks related to scope creep will be actively managed through the change control process.  Other risks, such as technical challenges or delays, will be addressed through a separate risk management plan.  The large existing documentation base mitigates some risks associated with initial requirements gathering.

**8.  Acceptance Criteria:**

The project will be considered complete when the following criteria are met:

* The software meets all functional and non-functional requirements as defined in the scope statement.
* The software passes all tests defined in the test plan.
* The documentation is complete and accurate.
* The project is delivered on time and within budget.
* The stakeholder sign-off on the final deliverables has been received.


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The Project Manager will ensure adherence to this plan and the PMBOK standards throughout the project.
