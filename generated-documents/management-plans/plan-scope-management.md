## Plan Scope Management for Requirements Gathering Agent

This plan outlines the scope management processes for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The plan leverages the existing project documentation (README, CHANGELOG, architecture documents, etc.) to establish a strong foundation.

**1.  1.1 Plan Scope Management:**

* **1.1.1 Scope Management Plan:** This document itself serves as the Scope Management Plan.  It details the processes, procedures, and responsibilities for managing the project scope.
* **1.1.2 Project Scope Statement:** The project scope statement will be derived from the project README and other documentation, clarifying the project objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.  Key aspects to define include:
    * **Project Objectives:**  Automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation from various project sources (README, other markdown files, etc.).  Specific objectives will include the generation of the 29 document types listed in the README.
    * **Project Deliverables:**  The 29 PMBOK documents (listed in the README), including a comprehensive project scope statement,  project charter, management plans, planning artifacts, stakeholder management documents, and technical analysis reports, all generated in Markdown (default) or other specified formats (JSON, YAML).  Additional deliverables include the CLI tool itself and updated documentation.
    * **Project Boundaries:**  Clearly defined in-scope and out-of-scope items. In-scope:  Generating PMBOK documents from specified input sources.  Out-of-scope:  Direct integration with external PM software (beyond file import/export), custom template creation by end-users, and support for non-markdown input formats beyond those specifically identified.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  All generated documents must adhere to PMBOK 7th edition standards and pass automated validation checks (as defined in the README). The CLI tool must be functional and user-friendly, with comprehensive documentation.
* **1.1.3  Scope Baseline:**  The approved Project Scope Statement and WBS will form the scope baseline. Any changes to the baseline will be formally documented and approved via a Change Control Process (described below).
* **1.1.4  WBS:** The existing README provides a good starting point for the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  This will be refined to include specific tasks for each deliverable and sub-deliverables,  including:
    *  Project Analysis & Context Building
    *  Document Generation (for each document type)
    *  Validation & Quality Assurance
    *  CLI Development & Testing
    *  Documentation Updates
* **1.1.5  WBS Dictionary:**  A detailed description of each work package within the WBS, including resources, duration estimates, and dependencies.
* **1.1.6  Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM):** A matrix clearly defining roles and responsibilities for each task within the WBS.  This will be based on the project team structure.
* **1.1.7  Change Control Process:**  A formal process for managing and approving changes to the scope baseline.  This includes:
    * **Change Request Submission:**  Formal requests for scope changes, including justification and impact assessment.
    * **Change Request Review:**  Evaluation of the change request by the project manager and relevant stakeholders.
    * **Change Approval:**  Formal approval or rejection of the change request by designated authority.
    * **Change Implementation:**  Implementation of approved changes, including updates to the scope baseline, schedule, and budget.
    * **Change Verification:** Verification that the implemented change meets the requirements and has the desired impact.


**2. 2.1 Collect Requirements:**

* **2.1.1  Requirements Gathering Techniques:**  The project leverages the existing README, CHANGELOG, and other documentation as primary requirements sources.  Further requirements elicitation may involve stakeholder interviews or feedback sessions, if necessary.
* **2.1.2  Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix linking requirements to deliverables and test cases to ensure all requirements are addressed.


**3. 3.1 Define Scope:**

* **3.1.1  Scope Definition:**  The project scope will be formally defined in the Project Scope Statement, based on the information gathered in the requirements gathering phase.
* **3.1.2  Scope Verification:**  The Project Scope Statement and WBS will be reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders.


**4. 4.1 Create WBS:**

* **4.1.1  Decomposition:** The WBS will be created by decomposing the project deliverables into smaller, manageable work packages.
* **4.1.2  WBS Validation:** The WBS will be reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders to ensure completeness and accuracy.


**5. 5.1 Control Scope:**

* **5.1.1  Scope Change Control:** The Change Control Process will be used to manage any changes to the approved scope baseline.
* **5.1.2  Scope Monitoring and Reporting:**  Regular monitoring of project progress against the scope baseline, with regular reporting to stakeholders.  This will include tracking of completed tasks within the WBS.
* **5.1.3  Scope Validation:**  Formal verification of the completed deliverables against the scope baseline.


**6.  Tools and Techniques:**

* **Software:**  Project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana) may be used for task management and tracking.
* **Documentation:**  The project will utilize existing documentation and create new documents as needed (e.g., Project Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary, RAM, Change Log).


This Plan Scope Management document serves as a living document and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure the plan remains relevant and effective.
