# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive project documentation, leveraging advanced contextual understanding and hierarchical authority recognition. This plan details how requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, traced, validated, and managed throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of the ADPA project is to deliver a robust, reliable, and user-friendly tool that automates the generation of high-quality project documentation, adhering to PMBOK standards and respecting organizational authority structures.  Specific objectives include:

*   Generating a complete suite of PMBOK-compliant documents.
*   Achieving 95% accuracy in document generation.
*   Maintaining a self-healing knowledge base to ensure data accuracy.
*   Providing a user-friendly CLI interface.
*   Supporting multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Implementing a modular architecture for future extensibility.
*   Achieving 100% PMBOK 7.0 compliance for all generated documents.
*   Integrating with SharePoint and Confluence for document publishing.


**3. Stakeholder Identification and Roles**

| Stakeholder         | Role                                     | Responsibilities                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Menno Drescher       | Project Lead/Developer                   | Overall project management, technical leadership, requirements gathering, implementation                                                            |
| Development Team     | Developers                               | Implementation, testing, maintenance                                                                                                                 |
| Product Owner        | Menno Drescher                           | Defining and prioritizing requirements, validating deliverables                                                                                         |
| Business Analysts    | N/A (Currently AI-driven)               | Requirements analysis (currently automated by ADPA itself)                                                                                         |
| End-Users (Project Managers, Business Analysts) | Stakeholders                               | Providing feedback, testing, and validating generated documents                                                                                   |
| Compliance Officer   | N/A (Implicit Requirement)              | Ensuring generated documents meet regulatory and organizational standards (implicitly addressed through PMBOK compliance and authority recognition features)|


**4. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis**

Requirements will be elicited through a combination of methods:

*   **Analysis of existing documentation:**  The system will automatically analyze existing project documentation (README.md, architecture documents, requirements specifications, etc.) to gather initial requirements. This leverages ADPA's advanced context analysis capabilities.
*   **User feedback and testing:**  Feedback from end-users will be gathered through testing and iterative development cycles.
*   **PMBOK 7.0 Standard:** The PMBOK 7.0 standard will serve as a core reference for functional requirements.


Requirements will be analyzed using the following techniques:

*   Prioritization based on impact and feasibility.
*   Conflict resolution using evidence-weight reasoning (as demonstrated by ADPA's capabilities).
*   Decomposition into smaller, manageable tasks.


**5. Requirements Documentation**

Requirements will be documented using a combination of:

*   User stories (for functional requirements).
*   Non-functional requirements specifications (performance, security, usability, etc.).
*   A requirements traceability matrix (linking requirements to design, implementation, and testing activities).

The primary documentation repository will be the project's GitHub repository.  Specific requirements documents will be maintained in the `docs/` and `requirements/` directories.

**6. Requirements Traceability**

A requirements traceability matrix will be used to track the flow of requirements throughout the development lifecycle. This matrix will link requirements to design specifications, test cases, and implemented features.  This traceability ensures that all requirements are addressed and that changes are properly managed.

**7. Requirements Validation and Verification**

Requirements will be validated through:

*   Reviews by stakeholders.
*   Prototyping and testing of key features.
*   Formal PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation (built-in to ADPA).

Requirements will be verified through:

*   Unit testing of individual components.
*   Integration testing of the entire system.
*   User acceptance testing (UAT).


**8. Requirements Change Management**

A formal change management process will be implemented to handle changes to requirements.  This process will include:

*   A change request form.
*   Evaluation of the impact of proposed changes.
*   Approval by relevant stakeholders.
*   Update of the requirements documentation and traceability matrix.

All change requests will be logged and tracked, maintaining a complete audit trail.

**9. Tools and Techniques**

*   **GitHub:** Version control for requirements documents and code.
*   **Project Management Software (e.g., Jira, Asana):** For task management and issue tracking.
*   **ADPA itself:** For automated requirements analysis and document generation.

**10.  Metrics and Reporting**

The following metrics will be tracked:

*   Number of requirements elicited.
*   Number of requirements changed.
*   Number of defects found during testing.
*   Time spent on requirements management activities.
*   PMBOK compliance scores for generated documents.

Regular reports will be generated to track progress and identify potential issues.

**11.  Roles and Responsibilities Summary**

*   **Menno Drescher (Project Lead):** Responsible for overall requirements management, including elicitation, analysis, documentation, validation, and change control.
*   **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing requirements and performing unit and integration testing.
*   **End-Users:** Responsible for providing feedback and performing user acceptance testing.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in scope and priorities.  The plan will be a living document, adapting to the project's evolving needs.
