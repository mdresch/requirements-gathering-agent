# Requirements Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Document Owner:** ADPA Project Management Office (PMO)  
**Contact:** [menno.drescher@gmail.com](mailto:menno.drescher@gmail.com)

## 1. Introduction

This Requirements Management Plan defines the approach, processes, tools, and responsibilities for managing requirements throughout the lifecycle of the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project. The plan ensures that all requirements—spanning business, functional, technical, compliance, and integration—are identified, documented, analyzed, tracked, and controlled in alignment with enterprise standards such as BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.

---

## 2. Purpose and Scope

**Purpose:**  
To establish a systematic, standards-driven approach for managing requirements in ADPA, supporting modular enterprise automation for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.

**Scope:**  
- All business, functional, non-functional, technical, and regulatory requirements for ADPA core, integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, etc.), and administrative interfaces.
- Traceability and control across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Compliance with standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK, GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.).

## 3. Requirements Management Process

### 3.1 Requirements Elicitation

- **Techniques Used:** Stakeholder interviews, standards mapping (BABOK/PMBOK/DMBOK), AI-driven analysis, competitive benchmarking, and user story workshops.
- **Sources:** Enterprise stakeholders, standards documentation, regulatory mandates, integration partners (Atlassian, Microsoft, Adobe), and end-user feedback.

### 3.2 Requirements Documentation

- **Artifacts:**  
  - Functional Requirements Specifications (FRS)  
  - Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Matrix  
  - Standards Compliance Matrices (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK)  
  - Integration API Specifications (OpenAPI/TypeSpec)  
  - User Stories & Use Cases

- **Tools:**  
  - ADPA Document Generator (automated, standards-compliant templates)  
  - Atlassian Confluence (integration for documentation publishing)  
  - SharePoint (document management)

### 3.3 Requirements Analysis

- **Validation:**  
  - Peer review for completeness, consistency, clarity, and testability  
  - AI-powered requirements gap and deviation analysis
- **Prioritization:**  
  - MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have)
  - Regulatory and business criticality ranking

### 3.4 Requirements Baseline

- Requirements are baselined at the end of the Analysis phase and prior to each major release (e.g., v3.2.0, v4.0).
- Baselined requirements are versioned and stored in the project’s main documentation repository and linked via Confluence.

### 3.5 Requirements Change Management

- **Process:**  
  - Change requests submitted via GitHub Issues (tagged `requirement-change`)
  - Impact analysis performed by business analyst and technical lead
  - Approval by Change Control Board (CCB)
  - Traceability updated in documentation and requirements repository

- **Tools:**  
  - GitHub Issues & Discussions  
  - Confluence Change Logs  
  - Automated notifications for all stakeholders

### 3.6 Requirements Traceability

- **Mechanism:**  
  - Unique ID assigned to each requirement  
  - Traceability matrix mapping requirements to design, implementation, test cases, and releases
- **Implementation:**  
  - Managed in Confluence and as JSON/YAML artifacts within the codebase  
  - Automated validation via ADPA analytics/reporting engine

### 3.7 Requirements Verification & Validation

- **Verification:**  
  - Automated and manual test cases mapped to each requirement  
  - CI/CD pipeline integration (unit, integration, and performance testing)
- **Validation:**  
  - Stakeholder review cycles  
  - Demo sessions using actual generated documents  
  - Compliance testing (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.)

---

## 4. Requirements Types and Classification

- **Business Requirements:**  
  - Enterprise automation for document generation, management, and analysis  
  - Multi-framework compliance (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK)

- **Functional Requirements:**  
  - AI-powered document processing engine  
  - REST API and CLI interfaces  
  - Integration with Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services  
  - Document template management and publishing

- **Non-Functional Requirements:**  
  - Security (enterprise-grade authentication, authorization)  
  - Scalability (horizontal scaling, microservices)  
  - Performance (fast document generation, low-latency APIs)  
  - Reliability and failover (multi-provider AI fallback)

- **Technical Requirements:**  
  - Node.js ≥18, TypeScript ≥5.7  
  - TypeSpec/OpenAPI API definitions  
  - Next.js 14, React 18 for admin interface  
  - JSON-based configuration, extensibility to SQL/NoSQL

- **Compliance & Regulatory Requirements:**  
  - Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, HIPAA
