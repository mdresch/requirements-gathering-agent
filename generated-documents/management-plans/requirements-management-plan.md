# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management plan for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project (Version 2.2.0).  This plan details the processes, tools, and responsibilities involved in eliciting, analyzing, specifying, verifying, and managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  The project aims to create an AI-powered system for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation, emphasizing international compliance and customer centricity within a banking context.  The lack of explicit security requirements in some documentation necessitates a careful consideration of security implications throughout the requirements process.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal is to develop a robust and reliable system capable of generating high-quality, PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI.  Specific objectives include:

* Automatic generation of PMBOK documents (Project Charters, Stakeholder Registers, Scope Management Plans, Risk Management Plans, Work Breakdown Structures, Compliance Documentation).
* Secure integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google Generative AI, etc.).
* A user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
* JSON-formatted output for interoperability.
* Schema validation for data integrity and PMBOK compliance.
* Modular architecture for future extensibility.
* Comprehensive user documentation and support materials.
* Compliance with all relevant banking legislation for international use.


**3. Requirements Elicitation**

* **Methods:**  A combination of methods will be used, including:
    * **Document analysis:** Reviewing existing project documentation (e.g.,  `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md`, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`).
    * **Stakeholder interviews:** Gathering requirements from the development team, product owner, architecture team, and testing team.  Specific focus will be placed on clarifying the scope of security and compliance requirements.
    * **Prototyping:** Developing early prototypes to validate requirements and gather feedback.
* **Tools:**  Confluence (as indicated by the available scripts), potentially supplemented by other collaboration tools.
* **Responsibilities:** The project manager will oversee the elicitation process, with individual team members contributing their expertise.

**4. Requirements Analysis**

* **Techniques:**  Requirements will be analyzed using techniques such as:
    * **Use case modeling:** Defining user interactions with the system.
    * **Data flow diagrams:** Illustrating data movement within the system.
    * **Functional decomposition:** Breaking down complex functions into smaller, manageable units.
* **Tools:**  Diagrams will be created using appropriate diagramming tools.  The analysis will leverage the information gathered from the various documents provided, paying close attention to discrepancies between documents detailing security requirements.
* **Responsibilities:** The system architect and lead developers will perform the requirements analysis.

**5. Requirements Specification**

* **Format:** Requirements will be documented using a consistent format, including a unique identifier, a clear description, priority, and source.  This will be a combination of text-based documentation and potentially a requirements management database.
* **Tools:**  A combination of documentation tools (e.g., Confluence, potentially a dedicated requirements management tool) will be used.
* **Responsibilities:** The project manager and technical writers will be responsible for creating and maintaining the requirements specification document.

**6. Requirements Verification and Validation**

* **Methods:**  Requirements will be verified and validated through:
    * **Reviews:** Formal and informal reviews by stakeholders.
    * **Prototyping:** Testing prototypes against requirements.
    * **Unit testing:** Testing individual components of the system.
    * **Integration testing:** Testing the interaction between components.
    * **System testing:** Testing the entire system.
* **Tools:**  The testing framework (Jest, as per the project metadata) and any relevant integration/API testing tools.
* **Responsibilities:** The testing team will be primarily responsible for verification and validation.

**7. Requirements Change Management**

* **Process:**  A formal change management process will be implemented, including:
    * **Change request submission:**  Formal requests for changes to requirements.
    * **Change request evaluation:** Assessment of the impact of change requests.
    * **Change approval:** Approval by relevant stakeholders.
    * **Change implementation:** Implementation of approved changes.
    * **Change verification:** Verification of implemented changes.
* **Tools:**  A change management tracking system (e.g., integrated into Confluence or a dedicated issue tracking system).
* **Responsibilities:** The project manager will oversee the change management process.

**8. Traceability**

* **Methods:**  Requirements traceability will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, linking requirements to design, code, and test cases.
* **Tools:**  Traceability will be managed using the chosen requirements management tool and version control system (Git).
* **Responsibilities:**  The project manager and development team will be responsible for maintaining traceability.

**9. Security Considerations**

Given the absence of explicit security requirements in some documents (`PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md`), a thorough security risk assessment will be conducted early in the project. This will involve identifying potential vulnerabilities and defining appropriate security controls.  The security requirements will be integrated into the overall requirements specification, addressing authentication, authorization, data protection, and other relevant aspects.  Compliance with relevant banking legislation will be a paramount concern.

**10. Tools and Technologies**

* **Requirements Management Tool:** Confluence (potentially supplemented by a dedicated tool).
* **Version Control:** Git.
* **Testing Framework:** Jest.
* **Collaboration Tools:**  As needed.

**11. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for requirements management.
* **System Architect:** Responsible for requirements analysis and high-level design.
* **Lead Developers:** Responsible for detailed design and implementation.
* **Testing Team:** Responsible for requirements verification and validation.
* **Technical Writers:** Responsible for creating and maintaining documentation.


**12.  Communication Plan**

Regular meetings and status reports will keep stakeholders informed of progress and any significant changes to requirements.  A communication plan will be developed to ensure timely and effective communication.


This plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The specific details of each process will be further defined in subsequent project documentation.
