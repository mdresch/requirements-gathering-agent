# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This plan details how requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, validated, and managed throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Purpose**

This plan aims to:

* Define the process for managing requirements throughout the ADPA project.
* Ensure that all stakeholder requirements are understood, documented, and traceable.
* Establish a clear and consistent approach to managing changes to requirements.
* Facilitate effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders.
* Maintain a high level of quality and accuracy in the requirements documentation.


**3. Scope**

This plan covers all aspects of requirements management for the ADPA project, including:

* **Requirement Elicitation:** Gathering requirements from various stakeholders (developers, PMOs, end-users).
* **Requirement Analysis:** Analyzing, prioritizing, and resolving conflicts between requirements.
* **Requirement Specification:** Documenting requirements clearly and unambiguously using standardized templates.
* **Requirement Validation:** Verifying that the requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.
* **Requirement Management:** Tracking and managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.


**4. Roles and Responsibilities**

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                                                                               |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager        | Overall responsibility for requirements management, ensuring adherence to this plan.                                                            |
| Lead Developer         | Responsible for technical feasibility analysis, translating requirements into technical specifications, and ensuring system compliance.         |
| Business Analyst       | Responsible for eliciting, analyzing, and documenting requirements from stakeholders.                                                       |
| Stakeholders           | Providing input on requirements, reviewing and approving requirements documentation.                                                          |
| Quality Assurance Team | Responsible for validating requirements and ensuring quality of generated documents.                                                        |


**5. Requirement Elicitation Techniques**

The following techniques will be used to elicit requirements:

* **Interviews:** Conducting interviews with key stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
* **Surveys:** Distributing surveys to gather input from a wider range of stakeholders.
* **Workshops:** Holding workshops to facilitate collaborative requirements gathering and brainstorming sessions.
* **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing project documentation (README, etc.) to identify implicit and explicit requirements.
* **Prototyping:** Developing prototypes to validate requirements and gather feedback.


**6. Requirement Analysis and Prioritization**

The collected requirements will be analyzed to identify:

* **Conflicts:** Resolving conflicts between competing requirements through negotiation and prioritization.
* **Dependencies:** Identifying dependencies between requirements.
* **Ambiguities:** Clarifying any ambiguous requirements.
* **Incompleteness:** Identifying missing requirements.

Prioritization will be based on factors such as:

* **Business Value:** The contribution of the requirement to the overall business objectives.
* **Risk:** The potential impact of not meeting the requirement.
* **Feasibility:** The technical feasibility of implementing the requirement.
* **Cost:** The cost of implementing the requirement.


**7. Requirement Documentation**

Requirements will be documented using a combination of:

* **User Stories:** Concise descriptions of functionality from the user's perspective.
* **Use Cases:** Detailed descriptions of interactions between users and the system.
* **Data Dictionary:** Definitions of data elements used in the system.
* **Technical Specifications:** Detailed technical requirements for the development team.

All requirements documentation will adhere to a consistent format and template.


**8. Requirement Validation and Verification**

Requirements will be validated through:

* **Reviews:** Formal reviews of the requirements documentation by stakeholders.
* **Walkthroughs:** Informal walkthroughs to identify any errors or inconsistencies.
* **Prototyping:** Testing the requirements through prototypes.

Requirements will be verified by:

* **Testing:** Ensuring that the implemented system meets the requirements.
* **Inspections:** Examining the system to ensure that it complies with the requirements.


**9. Requirement Change Management**

A formal change management process will be used to handle any changes to requirements:

1. **Change Request:** A formal change request must be submitted, documenting the proposed change, justification, and impact.
2. **Change Assessment:** The change request will be assessed by the project manager and relevant stakeholders to determine its feasibility and impact.
3. **Change Approval:**  The change will be approved or rejected based on the assessment.
4. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change will be implemented and documented.
5. **Change Verification:** The implemented change will be verified to ensure that it meets the requirements.


**10. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used to manage requirements:

* **Requirements Management Software:** A requirements management tool (e.g., Jira, Confluence) will be used to track requirements, changes, and issues.
* **Version Control:** Git will be used to manage versions of the requirements documentation.


**11. Traceability**

A traceability matrix will be maintained to track the relationships between requirements, design, code, and test cases. This will ensure that all requirements are implemented and tested.


**12. Acceptance Criteria**

The ADPA project will be considered complete when:

* All requirements defined in this document are met.
* The system is fully tested and validated.
* The system is deployed and operational.
* Stakeholder sign-off is obtained.


**13. Plan Updates**

This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect any changes in the project requirements or scope.  Updates will be communicated to all stakeholders.


This comprehensive Requirements Management Plan ensures a robust and controlled process for managing ADPA's requirements, leading to a successful and compliant project outcome.
