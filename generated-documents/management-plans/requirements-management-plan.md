## Requirements Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Version:** 1.0


### 1. Overview

**1.1 Purpose:** This plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing requirements throughout the Requirements Gathering Agent project lifecycle.  It ensures that requirements are clearly defined, documented, tracked, and managed effectively to meet project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

**1.2 Scope:** This plan covers all aspects of requirements management, from elicitation and analysis to validation and verification. It encompasses functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and assumptions.

**1.3 Alignment with Project Management Plan:** This Requirements Management Plan is integrated with the overall Project Management Plan and supports the project's scope, schedule, and cost objectives.  Changes to requirements will be managed through the project's integrated change control process.

**1.4 Integration with Scope Management:**  This plan closely integrates with the Scope Management Plan.  Requirements are the basis for defining the project scope, and changes to requirements will be managed through the scope change control process.


### 2. Requirements Planning

**2.1 Requirements Gathering Approach:**  A mixed approach will be used, combining:

* **Document Analysis:**  Thorough review of existing documentation (README, architecture documents, specifications, etc.) to identify existing requirements.  This leverages the inherent capabilities of the Requirements Gathering Agent itself for initial discovery and scoring.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Interviews with key stakeholders (developers, PMs, business analysts) to gather missing requirements and validate existing ones.
* **Prototyping and Demonstrations:**  Creating prototypes and demonstrations to validate requirements and gather feedback.

**2.2 Stakeholder Involvement Strategy:**  Stakeholders will be involved throughout the requirements lifecycle.  This will include regular meetings, reviews, and feedback sessions.  A Stakeholder Register will be maintained to track stakeholder involvement and communication preferences.

**2.3 Requirements Categories and Types:** Requirements will be categorized as:

* **Functional Requirements:** What the system *must do*.  Examples include generating specific PMBOK documents, integrating with Azure OpenAI, supporting multiple AI providers.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** How the system *must perform*. Examples include performance (response time), security, scalability, usability, maintainability.
* **Constraints:** Limitations or restrictions on the project, such as budget, timeline, technology limitations.
* **Assumptions:**  Factors believed to be true but not yet verified. Examples include the availability of specific Azure OpenAI models or the continued stability of API endpoints.

**2.4 Requirements Prioritization Criteria:**  Requirements will be prioritized based on:

* **Business Value:** The contribution of the requirement to the overall project goals.
* **Risk:** The potential impact of not meeting the requirement.
* **Dependencies:** The relationship of the requirement to other requirements.
* **Feasibility:** The technical and logistical feasibility of implementing the requirement.  This will heavily rely on the automated scoring system already built into the Requirements Gathering Agent.


### 3. Requirements Analysis

**3.1 Analysis Techniques and Tools:**  Techniques include:

* **Requirements Decomposition:** Breaking down high-level requirements into smaller, more manageable components.
* **Use Case Modeling:**  Describing how users interact with the system.
* **Data Modeling:**  Defining the data structures and relationships within the system.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** Linking requirements to design, code, and test cases.

Tools will include the Requirements Gathering Agent itself, spreadsheets, and potentially a dedicated requirements management tool if the project scales significantly.

**3.2 Requirements Validation Methods:**  Requirements will be validated through:

* **Reviews and Inspections:**  Formal reviews by stakeholders to identify inconsistencies and errors.
* **Prototyping:**  Creating prototypes to test the feasibility and usability of requirements.
* **Walkthroughs:**  Informal reviews with stakeholders to obtain feedback.

**3.3 Acceptance Criteria Definition:**  Acceptance criteria will be defined for each requirement to specify how the requirement will be tested and verified.

**3.4 Requirements Decomposition Approach:** A top-down approach will be used, decomposing high-level requirements into progressively more detailed sub-requirements.


### 4. Requirements Documentation

**4.1 Documentation Standards and Templates:**  Requirements will be documented using a consistent format, including:

* **Requirement ID:** A unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Description:** A clear and concise statement of the requirement.
* **Priority:**  The relative importance of the requirement.
* **Source:** The origin of the requirement (e.g., stakeholder interview, document analysis).
* **Status:** The current status of the requirement (e.g., proposed, approved, implemented).
* **Acceptance Criteria:** The conditions that must be met for the requirement to be considered satisfied.

**4.2 Requirements Attributes and Metadata:**  Additional metadata will be included as needed, such as rationale, dependencies, and risks.

**4.3 Traceability Requirements:**  A traceability matrix will be maintained to track the relationships between requirements, design, code, and test cases.

**4.4 Version Control and Configuration Management:**  Requirements will be managed using a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and maintain a history of revisions.


### 5. Requirements Communication

**5.1 Stakeholder Communication Plan:**  A communication plan will be developed to ensure that stakeholders are kept informed of requirements changes and progress.

**5.2 Requirements Review and Approval Process:**  A formal review and approval process will be used to ensure that requirements are accurate, complete, and consistent.

**5.3 Change Communication Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for communicating changes to requirements to stakeholders.

**5.4 Status Reporting and Metrics:** Regular reports will be generated to track the status of requirements and identify any potential issues.


### 6. Requirements Change Management

**6.1 Change Request Process:**  A formal change request process will be used to manage changes to requirements.

**6.2 Impact Analysis Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for analyzing the impact of proposed changes on the project schedule, cost, and scope.

**6.3 Change Approval Authority:**  The authority for approving changes to requirements will be clearly defined.

**6.4 Change Implementation Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for implementing approved changes to requirements.


### 7. Requirements Verification and Validation

**7.1 Verification Methods and Criteria:**  Requirements will be verified to ensure that they are correctly documented and understood.  This will involve reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections.

**7.2 Validation Approach and Schedule:**  Requirements will be validated to ensure that they meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  This will involve prototyping, testing, and user feedback.

**7.3 Acceptance Testing Strategy:**  An acceptance testing strategy will be developed to ensure that the system meets the defined acceptance criteria.

**7.4 Quality Assurance Procedures:**  Quality assurance procedures will be implemented to ensure that the requirements are met throughout the project lifecycle.


### 8. Requirements Traceability

**8.1 Traceability Matrix Development:**  A traceability matrix will be created to track the relationships between requirements, design, code, and test cases.

**8.2 Traceability Maintenance Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for maintaining the traceability matrix throughout the project lifecycle.

**8.3 Relationship Mapping Requirements:**  Requirements will be mapped to their related design elements, code modules, and test cases.

**8.4 Coverage Analysis Methods:**  Methods will be used to analyze the coverage of requirements by test cases.


### 9. Tools and Techniques

* **Requirements Management Tool:**  The Requirements Gathering Agent itself will serve as the primary tool, supplemented by spreadsheets for tracking and reporting.  Consideration will be given to a dedicated requirements management tool if necessary based on project scale and complexity.
* **Analysis and Modeling Techniques:** Use case modeling, data modeling, and requirements decomposition.
* **Documentation and Collaboration Tools:**  Git for version control, shared document repositories (e.g., Google Drive, SharePoint), and communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
* **Metrics and Measurement Tools:**  Spreadsheets and reporting tools for tracking requirements status, progress, and issues.


### 10. Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:**  Overall responsibility for requirements management.
* **Business Analyst:**  Responsible for requirements elicitation, analysis, and documentation.
* **Developers:** Responsible for implementing requirements.
* **Testers:** Responsible for verifying and validating requirements.
* **Stakeholders:**  Provide input and feedback on requirements.

Specific responsibilities will be further defined in the project's RACI matrix.  The Project Manager has ultimate approval authority on requirement changes.  Communication responsibilities will be clearly defined within the Communication Management Plan.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.
