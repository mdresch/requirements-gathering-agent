## Requirements Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


### 1. Overview

**1.1 Purpose:** This plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing requirements throughout the Requirements Gathering Agent project lifecycle.  It ensures that requirements are clearly defined, documented, analyzed, validated, and traced throughout the project, ultimately leading to the successful delivery of a product that meets stakeholder needs and expectations.

**1.2 Scope:** This plan covers all aspects of requirements management, from initial elicitation to final verification and validation. It encompasses functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and assumptions.  This plan applies to all project stakeholders, including the development team, project management office (PMO), and end-users.

**1.3 Alignment with Project Management Plan:** This Requirements Management Plan is integrated with the overall Project Management Plan and supports the project's objectives and constraints.  Changes to requirements will be managed through the project's formal change control process.

**1.4 Integration with Scope Management:**  This plan closely integrates with the Scope Management Plan.  The defined requirements will form the basis for the project scope, and any changes to the requirements will necessitate a scope change request.


### 2. Requirements Planning

**2.1 Requirements Gathering Approach:** A mixed approach will be used, combining the following techniques:

* **Document Analysis:** Review of existing project documentation (README, design documents, etc.).
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Structured interviews with key stakeholders to gather their requirements.
* **Surveys:**  Short surveys will be used to gather broad feedback from a wider range of stakeholders.
* **Prototyping:**  Early prototypes will be developed to validate and refine requirements.

**2.2 Stakeholder Involvement Strategy:**  A Stakeholder Register will be maintained, identifying key stakeholders and their roles in requirements management.  Regular communication and feedback mechanisms will be established to ensure continuous stakeholder engagement.

**2.3 Requirements Categories and Types:** Requirements will be categorized as follows:

* **Functional Requirements:**  What the system *must* do (e.g., generate PMBOK documents, integrate with Azure OpenAI).
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**  System qualities (e.g., performance, security, usability, scalability).
* **Constraints:**  Limitations on the project (e.g., budget, timeline, technology).
* **Assumptions:**  Factors assumed to be true (e.g., availability of Azure OpenAI API).

**2.4 Requirements Prioritization Criteria:**  Requirements will be prioritized based on the following criteria:

* **Business Value:**  The contribution of the requirement to the overall project goals.
* **Risk:**  The potential impact of not meeting the requirement.
* **Feasibility:**  The technical and logistical feasibility of implementing the requirement.
* **Dependencies:**  The relationship of the requirement to other requirements.  MoSCoW method will be applied where necessary.


### 3. Requirements Analysis

**3.1 Analysis Techniques and Tools:**  Requirements will be analyzed using techniques such as:

* **Use Case Modeling:**  To model user interactions with the system.
* **Data Flow Diagrams:** To illustrate data flow within the system.
* **Decision Tables:** To represent complex decision-making logic.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** To track the relationship between requirements, design, and test cases.

**3.2 Requirements Validation Methods:**  Requirements will be validated through:

* **Reviews and Inspections:** Formal reviews by stakeholders to identify inconsistencies and ambiguities.
* **Prototyping and User Testing:**  Testing of prototypes to verify user acceptance.
* **Walkthroughs:** Informal reviews to identify potential issues.

**3.3 Acceptance Criteria Definition:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria will be defined for each requirement, specifying how successful implementation will be determined.

**3.4 Requirements Decomposition Approach:**  Complex requirements will be decomposed into smaller, more manageable sub-requirements using a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).


### 4. Requirements Documentation

**4.1 Documentation Standards and Templates:**  Requirements will be documented using a standardized format, including:

* **Requirement ID:** A unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Description:** A clear and concise statement of the requirement.
* **Priority:** The priority level of the requirement.
* **Source:** The origin of the requirement.
* **Status:** The current status of the requirement (e.g., proposed, approved, implemented).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  The criteria for accepting the requirement.

**4.2 Requirements Attributes and Metadata:**  Relevant metadata will be associated with each requirement to aid in traceability and analysis.

**4.3 Traceability Requirements:**  A traceability matrix will be maintained to track the relationship between requirements, design, code, and test cases.

**4.4 Version Control and Configuration Management:**  A version control system (e.g., Git) will be used to manage changes to requirements documentation.


### 5. Requirements Communication

**5.1 Stakeholder Communication Plan:**  A communication plan will be developed to ensure timely and effective communication of requirements information to stakeholders.

**5.2 Requirements Review and Approval Process:**  A formal process will be established for reviewing and approving requirements documents.

**5.3 Change Communication Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for communicating changes to requirements to stakeholders.

**5.4 Status Reporting and Metrics:**  Regular status reports will be provided, including metrics such as the number of requirements completed, open issues, and changes implemented.


### 6. Requirements Change Management

**6.1 Change Request Process:**  A formal process will be established for submitting, reviewing, and approving change requests to requirements.

**6.2 Impact Analysis Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for analyzing the impact of proposed changes on other requirements, the schedule, and the budget.

**6.3 Change Approval Authority:**  The authority for approving or rejecting change requests will be clearly defined.

**6.4 Change Implementation Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for implementing approved changes to requirements.


### 7. Requirements Verification and Validation

**7.1 Verification Methods and Criteria:**  Requirements will be verified to ensure they are complete, consistent, unambiguous, and feasible.

**7.2 Validation Approach and Schedule:**  Requirements will be validated to ensure they meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  A validation plan will be developed outlining the approach and schedule.

**7.3 Acceptance Testing Strategy:**  An acceptance testing strategy will be defined to verify that the system meets the acceptance criteria.

**7.4 Quality Assurance Procedures:**  Quality assurance procedures will be implemented to ensure the quality of requirements and the overall project.


### 8. Requirements Traceability

**8.1 Traceability Matrix Development:**  A traceability matrix will be developed to track the relationships between requirements and other project artifacts.

**8.2 Traceability Maintenance Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for maintaining the traceability matrix throughout the project lifecycle.

**8.3 Relationship Mapping Requirements:**  The relationships between requirements will be clearly documented.

**8.4 Coverage Analysis Methods:**  Methods will be used to analyze the completeness of requirements coverage.


### 9. Tools and Techniques

* **Requirements Management Tool:**  Jira, or similar tool will be used to manage requirements.
* **Analysis and Modeling Techniques:** Use Case Modeling, Data Flow Diagrams, Decision Tables.
* **Documentation and Collaboration Tools:**  Confluence, Google Docs, or similar tools will be used for collaboration and documentation.
* **Metrics and Measurement Tools:**  Jira's built-in reporting functionality will be used to track progress and measure success.


### 10. Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:**  Overall responsibility for requirements management.
* **Business Analyst:**  Responsible for requirements elicitation, analysis, and documentation.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing requirements.
* **Stakeholders:**  Responsible for reviewing and approving requirements.

This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.
