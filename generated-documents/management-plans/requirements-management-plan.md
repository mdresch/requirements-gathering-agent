# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This plan details how requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, tracked, and managed throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of ADPA is to automate the generation of comprehensive and accurate project management documentation, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Specific objectives include:

*   Generating a complete suite of PMBOK documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, etc.).
*   Integrating with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Implementing a robust context management system to maximize AI performance.
*   Providing a user-friendly command-line interface.
*   Ensuring PMBOK 7.0 compliance and quality assurance through validation.
*   Maintaining a modular architecture for future extensibility.

**3. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis**

Requirements will be elicited from multiple sources, including:

*   **Project stakeholders:**  Project managers, business analysts, developers, and end-users.  Methods will include interviews, surveys, and workshops.
*   **Project documentation:**  The existing README.md file, internal documentation, and any other relevant project specifications.
*   **PMBOK 7.0 standard:** This will serve as a baseline for the required documentation outputs and their content.

Analysis will involve:

*   **Requirement decomposition:** Breaking down high-level requirements into smaller, manageable units.
*   **Requirement prioritization:** Ranking requirements based on importance and urgency.
*   **Conflict resolution:** Identifying and resolving conflicts between different requirements.
*   **Requirement validation:** Verifying that requirements are clear, concise, complete, consistent, feasible, and testable.

**4. Requirements Documentation**

Requirements will be documented using a combination of techniques:

*   **User stories:**  For functional requirements, focusing on user needs and desired outcomes.
*   **Use cases:**  For more complex functional requirements, detailing interactions and scenarios.
*   **Non-functional requirements specifications:**  Documenting performance, security, scalability, and other non-functional aspects.
*   **Requirements traceability matrix:**  Mapping requirements to design elements, test cases, and other project artifacts.

The requirements documentation will be stored in a version-controlled repository (Git) to ensure traceability and facilitate collaborative review.

**5. Requirements Tracking and Management**

A requirements tracking system will be used to monitor the status of each requirement throughout the project lifecycle.  This system will track:

*   Requirement ID
*   Description
*   Priority
*   Status (e.g., Proposed, Approved, Implemented, Verified, Closed)
*   Assigned to
*   Due date
*   Notes

Regular reviews of the requirements will be conducted to identify any changes or issues.  A change management process will be implemented to handle any modifications to approved requirements.

**6. Requirements Verification and Validation**

Verification and validation activities will ensure that the ADPA system meets the specified requirements.  These activities will include:

*   **Unit testing:**  Testing individual components of the system.
*   **Integration testing:**  Testing the interaction between different components.
*   **System testing:**  Testing the entire system as a whole.
*   **User acceptance testing (UAT):**  Testing the system with end-users to ensure it meets their needs.

**7. Tools and Technologies**

The following tools and technologies will be used to manage requirements:

*   **Version control system (Git):** For managing requirements documentation.
*   **Requirements management tool (e.g., Jira, Confluence):** For tracking requirements status and progress.
*   **Testing framework (e.g., Jest):** For automating testing activities.

**8. Roles and Responsibilities**

*   **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for requirements management.
*   **Business Analyst:** Responsible for requirements elicitation, analysis, and documentation.
*   **Developers:** Responsible for implementing the system and ensuring it meets requirements.
*   **Testers:** Responsible for verifying and validating the system.

**9. Communication Plan**

Regular communication will be maintained throughout the requirements management process.  This will include:

*   Weekly status meetings.
*   Regular email updates.
*   Use of a collaborative platform (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).

**10. Change Management Process**

Any changes to the requirements will be formally documented and approved through a change control process.  This process will include:

*   Change request submission.
*   Change impact analysis.
*   Change approval.
*   Change implementation.
*   Change verification.

**11. Acceptance Criteria**

The ADPA project will be considered successful when:

*   All approved requirements have been implemented and verified.
*   The system passes all planned testing activities.
*   End-users accept the system as meeting their needs.

**12.  Metrics and Reporting**

The following metrics will be tracked and reported:

*   Number of requirements elicited.
*   Number of requirements approved.
*   Number of requirements implemented.
*   Number of requirements verified.
*   Number of change requests.
*   Time spent on requirements management activities.

Regular reports will be generated to track progress and identify any potential issues.  These reports will be shared with stakeholders on a regular basis.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in project scope, priorities, and risks.
