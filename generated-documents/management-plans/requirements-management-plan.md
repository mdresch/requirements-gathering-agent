# Requirements Management Plan

## Overview

### Purpose and Scope of Requirements Management
The **Requirements Management Plan** provides a structured approach for gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing requirements throughout the lifecycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. It ensures that all project requirements align with stakeholder needs, project objectives, and PMBOK standards, while maintaining traceability and control. This plan defines the processes, roles, tools, and techniques necessary to manage requirements effectively.

### Alignment with Project Management Plan
This plan is fully integrated with the **Project Management Plan**, ensuring consistency across all management processes, including scope, schedule, cost, quality, and risk management. It supports the iterative refinement of requirements as the project evolves.

### Integration with Scope Management Processes
Requirements management is closely linked to the **Scope Management Plan** and ensures that all requirements are accurately translated into project deliverables. This integration helps prevent scope creep, ensures alignment with project objectives, and facilitates stakeholder validation.

## Requirements Planning

### Requirements Gathering Approach and Methodology
- **Approach**: Leverage workshops, interviews, surveys, and prototypes to collect requirements from stakeholders.
- **Methodology**: Use iterative techniques to refine requirements as the project evolves, enabling flexibility and adaptability.
- **Sources**: Analyze project documentation, including the project charter, stakeholder register, and scope statement, to identify initial requirements.

### Stakeholder Involvement Strategy
- **Engagement Plan**: Involve stakeholders in requirements elicitation, validation, and approval processes to ensure alignment with their needs.
- **Key Stakeholders**: Identify primary stakeholders (e.g., project managers, business analysts, product owners) and secondary stakeholders (e.g., end users, compliance teams).
- **Collaboration Tools**: Use tools like Azure DevOps, Google Workspace, or Jira for real-time collaboration and feedback.

### Requirements Categories and Types
- **Functional Requirements**: Features and capabilities the system must provide (e.g., PMBOK-compliant document generation).
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Quality attributes such as performance, scalability, security, and compliance.
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Requirements dictated by industry standards (e.g., PMBOK compliance).
- **Business Requirements**: High-level objectives and goals of the project.

### Requirements Prioritization Criteria
- **Criteria**: Prioritize requirements based on business value, stakeholder urgency, compliance needs, and technical feasibility.
- **Techniques**: Use MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Wonâ€™t-have) prioritization or weighted scoring methods.

## Requirements Analysis

### Analysis Techniques and Tools
- **Techniques**: Utilize SWOT analysis, use case modeling, and process flow diagrams to analyze requirements.
- **Tools**: Employ tools such as Lucidchart, Visio, or Figma for visualization and analysis.

### Requirements Validation Methods
- **Methods**: Perform structured walkthroughs, peer reviews, and stakeholder workshops to validate requirements.
- **Criteria**: Ensure requirements are clear, feasible, measurable, and aligned with project objectives.

### Acceptance Criteria Definition
- **Definition**: Establish specific, measurable criteria for each requirement to determine its successful implementation.
- **Examples**: "Generated documents must comply with PMBOK 7.0 standards" or "CLI must support command retry logic under failure scenarios."

### Requirements Decomposition Approach
- **Approach**: Break down high-level requirements into smaller, manageable components using Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) techniques.
- **Output**: Create detailed deliverables and activities that map to each requirement.

---

## Requirements Documentation

### Documentation Standards and Templates
- **Standards**: Follow PMBOK guidelines for documenting requirements.
- **Templates**: Use standardized templates for requirements lists, traceability matrices, and validation reports.

### Requirements Attributes and Metadata
- **Attributes**: Include unique ID, description, priority, category, source, owner, status, and acceptance criteria.
- **Metadata**: Track additional details such as creation date, last update, and related dependencies.

### Traceability Requirements
- **Matrix**: Develop a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) to map requirements to project deliverables.
- **Coverage**: Ensure all requirements are linked to specific outputs and objectives.

### Version Control and Configuration Management
- **Tools**: Use GitHub or Azure DevOps for version control of requirements documentation.
- **Process**: Implement configuration management practices to maintain document integrity and track changes.

---

## Requirements Communication

### Stakeholder Communication Plan
- **Frequency**: Provide weekly updates on requirements progress via project status meetings.
- **Channels**: Use email, project dashboards, or collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams for communication.
- **Artifacts**: Share documentation outputs such as requirements lists, validation reports, and traceability matrices.

### Requirements Review and Approval Process
- **Process**: Conduct formal reviews during project milestones, involving key stakeholders and sponsors.
- **Approval Authority**: Define decision-making roles for approving changes or additions to requirements.

### Change Communication Procedures
- **Procedures**: Notify impacted stakeholders of changes to requirements via email and project dashboards.
- **Impact Analysis**: Include a summary of the potential impact of changes on scope, schedule, and cost.

### Status Reporting and Metrics
- **Metrics**: Track requirements completion rates, validation success rates, and change request counts.
- **Reports**: Provide regular progress updates through dashboards and summary reports.

---

## Requirements Change Management

### Change Request Process
- **Process**: Define a structured process for submitting, reviewing, and approving change requests.
- **Documentation**: Use change request forms to capture the rationale, impact analysis, and approval status.

### Impact Analysis Procedures
- **Procedure**: Evaluate the impact of changes on project scope, objectives, deliverables, and constraints.
- **Tools**: Use impact analysis tools like Monte Carlo simulations or dependency mapping.

### Change Approval Authority
- **Authority**: Assign approval roles to the project sponsor or steering committee for significant changes.
- **Thresholds**: Define thresholds for minor and major changes requiring different levels of approval.

### Change Implementation Procedures
- **Implementation**: Update requirements documentation, traceability matrices, and project plans to reflect approved changes.
- **Testing**: Validate changes through acceptance testing before implementation.

---

## Requirements Verification and Validation

### Verification Methods and Criteria
- **Methods**: Perform requirements walkthroughs, inspections, and peer reviews to ensure correctness and completeness.
- **Criteria**: Verify that requirements align with project objectives and stakeholder needs.

### Validation Approach and Schedule
- **Approach**: Conduct validation activities iteratively during project phases.
- **Schedule**: Align validation milestones with project deliverables and phase gates.

### Acceptance Testing Strategy
- **Strategy**: Define test cases and scenarios to validate requirements against acceptance criteria.
- **Tools**: Use testing tools like Selenium or Postman for automated validation.

### Quality Assurance Procedures
- **Procedures**: Include requirements validation in quality audits and ensure alignment with PMBOK quality standards.

---

## Requirements Traceability

### Traceability Matrix Development
- **Development**: Create a detailed RTM mapping each requirement to deliverables, objectives, and test cases.
- **Format**: Use Excel, Jira, or a dedicated requirements management tool.

### Traceability Maintenance Procedures
- **Procedures**: Update the RTM throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes and additions.
- **Ownership**: Assign responsibility to the requirements manager for maintaining traceability.

### Relationship Mapping Requirements
- **Mapping**: Identify relationships between requirements, deliverables, constraints, and risks.
- **Tools**: Use visualization tools for dependency mapping.

### Coverage Analysis Methods
- **Methods**: Perform gap analysis to ensure all requirements are adequately covered by project deliverables.
- **Reporting**: Provide periodic coverage analysis reports to stakeholders.
