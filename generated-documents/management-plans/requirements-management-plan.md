# Requirements Management Plan: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management plan for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automating the monthly backup process and ensuring secure and reliable data recovery.  The plan details the processes for eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Project Overview**

Project Backup Vermigerous aims to automate the monthly backup of project data and implement robust validation and recovery mechanisms. The current system lacks automation, resulting in potential data loss and inefficient recovery procedures.  The automated system will categorize backups by year and month.

**3. Requirements Elicitation**

Requirements will be elicited through the following methods:

* **Stakeholder Interviews:** Discussions with IT administrators, system owners, and key personnel to understand their needs and concerns regarding backup and recovery.
* **Document Analysis:** Review of existing backup procedures, system documentation, and recovery plans to identify current processes and potential areas for improvement.
* **Prototype Review:** (If applicable) Feedback on a prototype of the automated backup system to validate design choices and usability.

**4. Requirements Analysis and Specification**

The elicited requirements will be analyzed to identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and conflicts.  They will then be documented using the following techniques:

* **Use Case Diagrams:**  To illustrate the interaction between the system and users during backup and recovery processes.
* **Data Flow Diagrams:** To depict the flow of data during the backup and restore operations.
* **User Stories:** To describe the functionality from the perspective of different user roles (e.g., administrator, system operator).  Examples include:
    * As an administrator, I want to schedule automated backups monthly so that I don't have to manually perform this task.
    * As a system operator, I want the system to validate backups to ensure data integrity.
    * As a system operator, I want a clear and concise report of the backup status and any errors encountered.

**5. Requirements Validation**

Requirements will be validated through:

* **Reviews:** Formal reviews by stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and feasibility.
* **Prototyping:** (If applicable) Testing of prototypes to validate the functionality and usability of the system.
* **Proof of Concept:** Implementation of a small-scale version of the system to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution.

**6. Requirements Management Tools and Techniques**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** Used to track the relationship between requirements, design, and implementation.
* **Version Control System (e.g., Git):** To manage changes to the requirements documentation.
* **Issue Tracking System (e.g., Jira):** To manage and track defects and change requests.

**7. Requirements Change Management**

A formal change control process will be implemented to manage changes to the requirements.  This process will include:

* **Change Request Form:**  A standardized form for submitting change requests.
* **Change Review Board:** A group of stakeholders responsible for evaluating and approving change requests.
* **Impact Assessment:**  An analysis of the impact of a change request on the project schedule, budget, and scope.

**8. Baseline Requirements**

Once the requirements have been validated, a baseline will be established.  Any changes to the baseline will be formally managed through the change control process.

**9.  Specific Requirements (Examples)**

* **Functional Requirements:**
    * Automated monthly backup scheduling.
    * Incremental or differential backup strategy.
    * Data integrity checks (checksum validation).
    * Secure storage using Azure Blob Storage with encryption (AES-256) and a Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy.
    * Multi-region replication for disaster recovery.
    * Automated recovery testing in a sandbox environment.
    * Backup metadata tagging (project name, year, month, version).
    * Reporting and alerting on backup status and failures (integration with Azure Monitor).
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**
    * Security:  Compliance with organization's security policies.
    * Performance:  Backups should complete within a defined timeframe.
    * Scalability:  The system should be able to handle increasing data volumes.
    * Reliability:  The system should be highly reliable and minimize data loss.
    * Maintainability:  The system should be easy to maintain and update.

**10.  Acceptance Criteria**

The system will be considered acceptable if it meets all the functional and non-functional requirements and passes the acceptance testing.  This will include successful completion of automated recovery tests.

**11.  Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for the project and requirements management.
* **System Architect:** Responsible for the design of the automated backup system.
* **Developers:** Responsible for the implementation of the system.
* **Testers:** Responsible for testing the system and verifying that it meets the requirements.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for deploying and maintaining the system.


**12.  Schedule**

A detailed schedule for requirements management activities will be developed and maintained.  This schedule will be updated as needed to reflect changes in the project.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.
