# Requirements Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for managing requirements throughout the lifecycle of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It details the processes, responsibilities, and tools used to elicit, analyze, document, and validate requirements.  The plan prioritizes the rapid generation of high-quality, BABOK v3-compliant deliverables while maintaining scalability and flexibility for future enhancements.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal is to establish a robust and efficient process for managing requirements, ensuring that the final product meets stakeholder needs and industry standards (BABOK v3).  Specific objectives include:

*   **Complete Requirements Elicitation:** Capture all necessary functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Create clear, concise, and unambiguous requirement specifications.
*   **Effective Communication:** Facilitate clear communication of requirements among stakeholders.
*   **Traceability:** Maintain traceability between requirements, design, and testing.
*   **Change Management:** Establish a process for managing changes to requirements.
*   **Validation and Verification:** Ensure requirements are valid, complete, and consistent.


## 3. Scope

This plan covers all requirements related to the development and deployment of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, including:

*   Functional requirements for API functionality (document generation, template management, etc.).
*   Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc.).
*   Interface requirements (API specifications, CLI interaction).
*   Data requirements (input data formats, output data formats).


## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project Manager        | Overall management of the requirements management process, ensuring adherence to the plan.                                                        |
| Business Analyst       | Eliciting, analyzing, documenting, and validating requirements; acting as the primary liaison between stakeholders and the development team. |
| Development Team Lead | Ensuring the development team understands and implements the requirements correctly.                                                              |
| Developers            | Implementing the requirements based on specifications provided by the Business Analyst.                                                         |
| Testers               | Verifying that the developed system meets the specified requirements.                                                                            |
| Stakeholders           | Providing input and feedback on requirements.                                                                                                    |


## 5. Requirements Elicitation Techniques

The following techniques will be used to elicit requirements:

*   **Interviews:** Conducting interviews with key stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
*   **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing documentation (e.g., project charter, business case) to identify requirements.
*   **Workshops:** Facilitating workshops to gather requirements from multiple stakeholders.
*   **Prototyping:** Developing prototypes to validate requirements and gather feedback.
*   **API-First Approach:** Using TypeSpec to define API contracts and drive requirements.


## 6. Requirements Analysis and Documentation

*   **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** An RTM will be used to track the relationship between requirements, design, and test cases.
*   **Use Cases:** Use cases will be developed to describe the interaction between the system and its users.
*   **User Stories:** User stories will be used to capture high-level functional requirements from a user's perspective.
*   **Requirement Specification Document:** A formal document will be created to specify all functional and non-functional requirements.  This will be based on the  `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md` document, but will include security considerations for the production-ready version.
*   **API Specification (OpenAPI):**  The API specification (`api-specs/`) will be the primary source of truth for API-related requirements.


## 7. Requirements Validation and Verification

Requirements will be validated and verified through the following activities:

*   **Reviews:** Formal reviews of the requirement specifications by stakeholders and the development team.
*   **Prototyping:** Testing prototypes to ensure they meet user needs.
*   **Testing:** Executing various testing activities (unit, integration, system, user acceptance testing) to verify that the system conforms to the requirements.


## 8. Requirements Change Management

A formal change management process will be followed to manage changes to requirements.  This process will include:

*   **Change Request Form:** A standardized form will be used to submit change requests.
*   **Change Control Board (CCB):** A CCB will review and approve or reject change requests.
*   **Impact Analysis:** An impact analysis will be conducted to assess the impact of change requests on the project schedule and budget.


## 9. Tools and Technologies

*   **Requirements Management Tool:**  [Specify the tool to be used, if any.  Consider tools like Jira, Confluence, or dedicated requirements management software.]
*   **Version Control System (Git):**  Used to manage changes to requirement documents and other project artifacts.
*   **Collaboration Tools:**  [Specify tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc.]


## 10. Metrics and Reporting

The following metrics will be tracked and reported:

*   Number of requirements elicited.
*   Number of requirements changed.
*   Number of defects found during testing.
*   Time spent on requirements management activities.


## 11. Plan Maintenance

This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in project scope and requirements.


## 12. Appendix

[Include any relevant appendices, such as templates for requirement specifications, change request forms, etc.]


This Requirements Management Plan provides a framework for managing requirements effectively throughout the project.  Adherence to this plan will ensure that the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent meets stakeholder expectations and delivers on its promise of revolutionary enterprise business analysis automation.
