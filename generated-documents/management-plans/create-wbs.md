## Create WBS Process

### **Process Overview**
The **Create WBS** process is a systematic approach to breaking down a project’s deliverables and work into smaller, manageable components. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) serves as a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope, ensuring that all work required to complete the project is fully accounted for.

#### **Purpose and Objectives**
- Provide a clear, structured breakdown of project deliverables.
- Ensure alignment between project scope and deliverables.
- Facilitate accurate planning, scheduling, resource allocation, and monitoring.
- Enhance communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

#### **Process Scope and Boundaries**
- Focuses on defining and organizing the project scope into manageable work packages.
- Encompasses all tasks and deliverables included in the project scope statement.
- Excludes detailed scheduling, resource assignments, and cost estimation, which are addressed in separate processes.

#### **Integration with Scope Management Processes**
The WBS creation process integrates closely with scope definition, validation, and control processes. It serves as the foundation for accurate project planning and execution.

#### **PMBOK Alignment**
- **Process Group:** Planning
- **Knowledge Area:** Project Scope Management

### **Process Inputs**
The **Create WBS** process relies on several key inputs to ensure accuracy and alignment with project goals:

1. **Project Scope Statement**  
   - Defines the project’s deliverables, objectives, boundaries, and constraints.  
   - Serves as the primary reference for WBS development.

2. **Requirements Documentation**  
   - Provides detailed functional and non-functional requirements.  
   - Ensures inclusion of all stakeholder needs in the deliverables.

3. **Enterprise Environmental Factors**  
   - Industry standards, regulatory requirements, and organizational culture.  
   - Influences WBS structure and level of detail.

4. **Organizational Process Assets**  
   - Historical WBS templates, lessons learned, and organizational standards.  
   - Facilitates efficient and standardized WBS creation.

---

### **Tools and Techniques**
The following tools and techniques are employed to develop the WBS:

1. **Decomposition Techniques**  
   - Break deliverables into smaller, manageable work packages.  
   - Ensure alignment with the 100% rule (all work is included).

2. **Expert Judgment**  
   - Leverage the expertise of stakeholders, subject matter experts, and project team members.  
   - Ensure accuracy and feasibility in the decomposition process.

3. **Templates and Historical Information**  
   - Use organizational process assets to streamline WBS creation.  
   - Reference previous projects with similar scope and deliverables.

4. **Rolling Wave Planning**  
   - Develop the WBS iteratively as more information becomes available.  
   - Focus on near-term deliverables while leaving placeholders for future work.

---

### **Process Outputs**
The **Create WBS** process results in key deliverables that form part of the project’s scope baseline:

1. **Scope Baseline**  
   - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Hierarchical representation of project deliverables and work packages.  
   - **WBS Dictionary:** Detailed descriptions of each work package, including scope, deliverables, assumptions, constraints, and dependencies.  
   - **Updated Project Scope Statement:** Incorporates any refinements identified during the WBS creation process.

2. **Project Documents Updates**  
   - Updates to scope-related documents, such as requirements documentation and stakeholder registers.

3. **Lessons Learned and Process Improvements**  
   - Capture insights and feedback from the WBS creation process for future projects.

---

### **WBS Development Activities**
The following activities define the process of developing the WBS:

1. **Scope Decomposition Approach**  
   - Systematically break down project deliverables into smaller, manageable elements.  
   - Ensure alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.

2. **Work Package Definition Criteria**  
   - Define work packages based on clear deliverables, measurable outputs, and accountability.  
   - Ensure each work package can be accurately estimated and monitored.

3. **Hierarchical Structure Development**  
   - Create a hierarchical structure with levels representing deliverables, sub-deliverables, and work packages.  
   - Use numbering and coding standards for clarity and traceability.

4. **100% Rule Application**  
   - Ensure the WBS includes 100% of the project scope and excludes any non-scope work.

---

### **Quality Considerations**
To ensure the WBS meets quality standards, the following steps are taken:

1. **WBS Quality Criteria and Standards**  
   - Verify accuracy, completeness, and alignment with project objectives.  
   - Ensure compliance with organizational and industry standards.

2. **Review and Validation Processes**  
   - Conduct peer reviews and stakeholder validation of the WBS.  
   - Verify that all deliverables and work packages are accounted for.

3. **Stakeholder Approval Procedures**  
   - Involve key stakeholders in approving the WBS and WBS Dictionary.  
   - Obtain formal sign-off to ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations.

4. **Documentation Requirements**  
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation to support scope validation and control processes.

### **Process Guidelines**
Follow these best practices to ensure the effective creation of a WBS:

1. **WBS Creation Best Practices**  
   - Start with high-level deliverables and progressively decompose into smaller work packages.  
   - Involve subject matter experts and key stakeholders in the process.

2. **Common Decomposition Patterns**  
   - Group work packages by phases, deliverables, or functional areas.  
   - Ensure logical grouping to facilitate resource allocation and progress tracking.

3. **Work Package Sizing Guidelines**  
   - Define work packages small enough for accurate estimation but large enough to avoid micromanagement.  
   - Use the "8/80 Rule" as a guideline (work packages should take 8-80 hours to complete).

4. **Numbering and Coding Standards**  
   - Assign unique identifiers to each work package for traceability and reporting.  
   - Use consistent numbering conventions across all project documents.

---

### **Integration Points**
The WBS connects to several other project management processes to ensure seamless integration:

1. **Connection to Schedule Development**  
   - The WBS serves as the foundation for activity sequencing and schedule creation.

2. **Resource Planning Integration**  
   - Work packages guide resource allocation and workload distribution.

3. **Cost Estimation Alignment**  
   - WBS details provide a basis for accurate cost estimation and budgeting.

4. **Risk Identification Support**  
   - Decomposing deliverables helps identify potential risks at the work package level.

---

### **Process Metrics**
Track and measure the effectiveness of the WBS creation process using the following metrics:

1. **WBS Quality Measurements**  
   - Completeness, clarity, and stakeholder satisfaction with the WBS.

2. **Development Efficiency Metrics**  
   - Time taken to create the WBS relative to project size and complexity.

3. **Stakeholder Satisfaction Indicators**  
   - Feedback on the usefulness and accuracy of the WBS.

4. **Process Improvement Measures**  
   - Track lessons learned and implement improvements for future projects.

---

### **Risk Management**
Identify and mitigate risks associated with WBS development:

1. **WBS-Related Risks and Mitigation**  
   - Risks: Scope gaps, excessive complexity, or misaligned deliverables.  
   - Mitigation: Conduct thorough reviews, involve experts, and validate deliverables.

2. **Quality Assurance Procedures**  
   - Implement regular quality checks and validation steps during WBS creation.

3. **Review and Approval Processes**  
   - Obtain formal stakeholder approval to mitigate scope-related disputes.

4. **Change Control Considerations**  
   - Maintain version control for the WBS and integrate changes through formal change control processes.
