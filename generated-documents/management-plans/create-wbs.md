## Create WBS Process

This document outlines the process for creating a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK Guide standards.

### 1. Process Overview

**1.1 Purpose and Objectives:** The purpose of this process is to decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable components (work packages) to facilitate planning, scheduling, execution, monitoring, and controlling.  The objectives are to create a comprehensive, accurate, and verifiable WBS that serves as the basis for scope definition and subsequent project management activities.

**1.2 Process Scope and Boundaries:** This process encompasses the decomposition of the project scope defined in the Project Scope Statement into a hierarchical structure of work packages.  It includes the creation of the WBS, WBS Dictionary, and updates to the Project Scope Statement.  It excludes the detailed scheduling and resource allocation activities, which are subsequent processes.

**1.3 Integration with Scope Management Processes:** This process is a key component of the Scope Management process group.  The WBS, once approved, becomes part of the scope baseline, providing a defined scope against which project performance is measured.  It directly feeds into the Create Schedule, Estimate Costs, and Plan Resource Management processes.

**1.4 PMBOK Process Group and Knowledge Area Alignment:** This process belongs to the Planning Process Group and the Scope Management Knowledge Area of the PMBOK Guide.


### 2. Process Inputs

* **Project Scope Statement:**  Provides the overall project objectives, deliverables, and high-level scope description. (See `03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD`)
* **Requirements Documentation:** Detailed functional and non-functional requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent. (See `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`)
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors:**  Organizational policies, procedures, and standards that influence the WBS creation.
* **Organizational Process Assets:**  Templates, guidelines, and historical information from past projects that can be leveraged for WBS creation.


### 3. Tools and Techniques

* **Decomposition Techniques:**  Top-down, bottom-up, and mind-mapping techniques will be used to break down the project scope.
* **Expert Judgment:**  The project manager and subject matter experts will provide input and validate the WBS.
* **Templates and Historical Information:**  Existing WBS templates and data from similar projects will be used as references.
* **Rolling Wave Planning:**  A rolling wave planning approach will be used, refining the WBS details iteratively as more information becomes available.


### 4. Process Outputs

* **Scope Baseline (WBS, WBS Dictionary, Project Scope Statement):** The approved WBS, WBS Dictionary, and updated Project Scope Statement form the scope baseline.
* **Project Documents Updates:**  Relevant project documents, such as the Project Management Plan, will be updated to reflect the approved WBS.
* **Lessons Learned and Process Improvements:**  Any lessons learned during WBS creation will be documented for future project improvements.


### 5. WBS Development Activities

**5.1 Scope Decomposition Approach:** A top-down approach will be used, starting with the major deliverables identified in the Project Scope Statement and progressively decomposing them into smaller work packages.

**5.2 Work Package Definition Criteria:** Work packages will be defined based on the following criteria:
    *  Manageability:  Each work package should be small enough to be managed effectively.
    *  Measurability:  Clear and measurable deliverables should be defined for each work package.
    *  Assignability:  Work packages should be clearly assignable to specific team members or resources.
    *  Independence: Work packages should be relatively independent of each other, to the extent possible.

**5.3 Hierarchical Structure Development:** The WBS will be represented as a hierarchical tree structure, with the project at the top level and work packages at the lowest level.

**5.4 100% Rule Application:** The WBS will adhere to the 100% rule, ensuring that all elements of the project scope are included in the WBS.


### 6. Quality Considerations

**6.1 WBS Quality Criteria and Standards:** The WBS will be evaluated based on its completeness, accuracy, clarity, and consistency with the project scope statement.

**6.2 Review and Validation Processes:** The WBS will be reviewed and validated by the project team and key stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

**6.3 Stakeholder Approval Procedures:** Formal approval of the WBS will be obtained from relevant stakeholders.

**6.4 Documentation Requirements:** The WBS and WBS Dictionary will be formally documented and maintained throughout the project lifecycle.


### 7. Process Guidelines

* **WBS Creation Best Practices:**  Follow established best practices for WBS creation, including using clear and concise language, avoiding ambiguity, and ensuring consistency.
* **Common Decomposition Patterns:**  Utilize common decomposition patterns, such as functional decomposition, product decomposition, and hybrid approaches, as appropriate.
* **Work Package Sizing Guidelines:**  Adhere to guidelines for work package size, aiming for work packages that can be completed within a specified timeframe (e.g., 1-4 weeks).
* **Numbering and Coding Standards:**  Implement a consistent numbering and coding system for the WBS to ensure clear identification and traceability of work packages.


### 8. Integration Points

* **Connection to Schedule Development:** The WBS will serve as the basis for developing the project schedule.
* **Resource Planning Integration:** The WBS will be used to identify the resources required for each work package.
* **Cost Estimation Alignment:** The WBS will be used to estimate the cost of each work package.
* **Risk Identification Support:** The WBS will help identify potential risks associated with each work package.


### 9. Process Metrics

* **WBS Quality Measurements:**  Metrics such as completeness, accuracy, and clarity will be used to assess the quality of the WBS.
* **Development Efficiency Metrics:**  Metrics such as the time taken to create the WBS and the number of revisions will be tracked.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction Indicators:**  Feedback from stakeholders will be collected to assess their satisfaction with the WBS.
* **Process Improvement Measures:**  Continuous improvement measures will be implemented based on lessons learned during WBS creation.


### 10. Risk Management

* **WBS-related risks and mitigation:**  Potential risks associated with WBS creation, such as scope creep or inaccurate decomposition, will be identified and mitigated.
* **Quality Assurance Procedures:**  Quality assurance procedures will be implemented to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the WBS.
* **Review and Approval Processes:**  Formal review and approval processes will be followed to ensure stakeholder buy-in.
* **Change Control Considerations:**  A formal change control process will be in place to manage any changes to the WBS after its approval.


This Create WBS Process document provides a framework for developing a robust and effective WBS for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Adherence to this process will ensure a clear understanding of the project scope and facilitate successful project execution.
