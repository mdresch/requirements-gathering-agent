## Create WBS Process

**Document ID:** WBS-PROC-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** PMBOK-Certified Project Manager


### 1. Process Overview

**1.1 Purpose and Objectives:** The purpose of this process is to create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The objectives are to:

* Decompose the project scope into manageable work packages.
* Establish a clear and comprehensive understanding of the project scope and its constituent elements.
* Provide a basis for planning, scheduling, budgeting, and controlling the project.
* Facilitate communication and collaboration among project stakeholders.

**1.2 Process Scope and Boundaries:** This process encompasses the complete creation of the WBS, including decomposition, definition of work packages, and creation of the WBS dictionary. It excludes the creation of the project schedule, budget, or resource allocation, although the WBS serves as a critical input for these processes.

**1.3 Integration with Scope Management Processes:** This process is a key component of the scope management process, specifically the "Define Scope" and "Create WBS" processes as defined in PMBOK.  The WBS serves as a primary output of this process and a key input for the "Validate Scope" and "Control Scope" processes.

**1.4 PMBOK Process Group and Knowledge Area Alignment:** This process belongs to the Planning process group and the Scope Management knowledge area within the PMBOK framework.


### 2. Process Inputs

* **Project Scope Statement:**  A document that describes the project's objectives, deliverables, and boundaries. (See: 03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD)
* **Requirements Documentation:** Detailed descriptions of the project's functional and non-functional requirements. (See: 02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD,  relevant sections of README.md)
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** External factors that may influence the project, such as organizational policies, regulatory requirements, and market conditions.
* **Organizational Process Assets:**  Templates, guidelines, and historical information that can be used to support the WBS creation process. (See:  IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE-PROVIDER-CHOICE-MENU.MD for example of process asset)


### 3. Tools and Techniques

* **Decomposition Techniques:**  Techniques used to break down the project scope into smaller, more manageable components.  For this project, we will utilize a combination of top-down and bottom-up decomposition.
* **Expert Judgment:**  Input from experienced project managers and subject matter experts will be used to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the WBS.
* **Templates and Historical Information:** Existing WBS templates and information from past projects will be leveraged to streamline the process and ensure consistency.
* **Rolling Wave Planning:**  A planning approach where the level of detail in the WBS increases as the project progresses.  This will be employed to handle uncertainties and evolving requirements.


### 4. Process Outputs

* **Scope Baseline (WBS, WBS Dictionary, Project Scope Statement):** The approved WBS, WBS dictionary, and project scope statement form the scope baseline, which is a formal agreement on the project scope.
* **Project Documents Updates:** The project management plan and other relevant project documents will be updated to reflect the approved WBS.
* **Lessons Learned and Process Improvements:**  Any insights gained during the WBS creation process will be documented for future use and improvement.


### 5. WBS Development Activities

**5.1 Scope Decomposition Approach:** A hierarchical decomposition approach will be used, starting with the project's major deliverables and progressively breaking them down into smaller work packages.  This will be guided by the project scope statement and requirements documentation.

**5.2 Work Package Definition Criteria:** Work packages will be defined based on the following criteria:

* **Manageability:** Each work package should be small enough to be managed effectively.
* **Independence:** Work packages should be relatively independent of each other.
* **Measurability:**  Progress on each work package should be easily measurable.
* **Assignability:** Each work package should be assignable to a specific individual or team.

**5.3 Hierarchical Structure Development:** The WBS will be represented using a hierarchical structure, with the project at the highest level and work packages at the lowest level.  A clear numbering system will be used to identify each work package.

**5.4 100% Rule Application:** The WBS will adhere to the 100% rule, ensuring that all elements of the project scope are included within the WBS.


### 6. Quality Considerations

**6.1 WBS Quality Criteria and Standards:** The WBS will meet the following quality criteria:

* **Accuracy:**  The WBS accurately reflects the project scope.
* **Completeness:** All elements of the project scope are included in the WBS.
* **Clarity:** The WBS is easy to understand and interpret.
* **Consistency:** The WBS is consistent with the project scope statement and other project documents.

**6.2 Review and Validation Processes:** The WBS will be reviewed and validated by key stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.

**6.3 Stakeholder Approval Procedures:**  Formal approval of the WBS will be obtained from relevant stakeholders.

**6.4 Documentation Requirements:**  The WBS and WBS dictionary will be properly documented and maintained.


### 7. Process Guidelines

* **WBS Creation Best Practices:** Adhere to established best practices for WBS creation, such as using clear and concise language, avoiding ambiguity, and using a consistent numbering system.
* **Common Decomposition Patterns:** Utilize common decomposition patterns, such as functional decomposition or hierarchical decomposition, to ensure a logical and efficient WBS.
* **Work Package Sizing Guidelines:**  Follow guidelines for work package sizing, ensuring that work packages are neither too large nor too small.
* **Numbering and Coding Standards:**  Utilize a consistent numbering and coding system for work packages to ensure traceability and ease of reference.


### 8. Integration Points

* **Connection to Schedule Development:** The WBS will serve as the basis for developing the project schedule.
* **Resource Planning Integration:** The WBS will be used to identify the resources required for each work package.
* **Cost Estimation Alignment:** The WBS will be used to estimate the cost of each work package.
* **Risk Identification Support:** The WBS will help in identifying potential risks associated with each work package.


### 9. Process Metrics

* **WBS Quality Measurements:**  Metrics such as accuracy, completeness, and clarity will be used to assess the quality of the WBS.
* **Development Efficiency Metrics:** Metrics such as the time taken to create the WBS and the number of iterations required will be tracked to assess efficiency.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction Indicators:**  Feedback from stakeholders will be collected to assess their satisfaction with the WBS.
* **Process Improvement Measures:**  Continuous improvement measures will be implemented based on lessons learned and feedback.


### 10. Risk Management

* **WBS-related Risks and Mitigation:** Potential risks associated with the WBS creation process, such as scope creep and inaccurate estimates, will be identified and mitigated.
* **Quality Assurance Procedures:**  Quality assurance procedures will be implemented to ensure the quality of the WBS.
* **Review and Approval Processes:**  Formal review and approval processes will be followed to ensure stakeholder buy-in and minimize errors.
* **Change Control Considerations:**  A change control process will be in place to manage any changes to the WBS after it has been approved.


This document provides a comprehensive framework for creating the WBS for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Adherence to this process will ensure that the WBS is accurate, complete, and serves as a solid foundation for the successful execution of the project.
