# Create WBS Process for ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) creation process for the ADPA project.  The WBS will decompose the project into manageable components, facilitating planning, scheduling, execution, and control.  Given ADPA's modular architecture and diverse feature set, a phased approach to WBS creation is recommended.

## 2. Phased WBS Creation

Due to the complexity and breadth of features in ADPA, we will adopt a phased WBS approach, focusing on key deliverables within each phase. This allows for iterative refinement and adaptation as the project progresses.

**Phase 1: Core Framework Development (Weeks 1-8)**

This phase focuses on building the foundational components of the ADPA framework.

**Phase 2: AI Integration & Document Generation (Weeks 9-16)**

This phase integrates multiple AI providers and implements core document generation functionalities.

**Phase 3: Enterprise Integration & API Development (Weeks 17-24)**

This phase focuses on integrating with enterprise systems (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services) and developing a robust REST API.

**Phase 4: Admin Interface & CLI Enhancement (Weeks 25-32)**

This phase develops and enhances the admin web interface and CLI tools.

**Phase 5: Testing, Deployment & Documentation (Weeks 33-40)**

This phase encompasses comprehensive testing, deployment to production environments, and final documentation.


## 3. WBS Structure (Example - Phase 1: Core Framework Development)

This example illustrates the WBS structure for Phase 1.  Subsequent phases will follow a similar structure, adapted to their specific deliverables.  The WBS will utilize a hierarchical decomposition, employing a numbering system for clarity.


1.0 **Phase 1: Core Framework Development**

    1.1 **Project Setup & Environment Configuration:**
        1.1.1  Establish development environment
        1.1.2  Configure version control (Git)
        1.1.3  Set up CI/CD pipeline
        1.1.4  Define coding standards and style guide

    1.2 **Core Module Development:**
        1.2.1  Develop AI Processing Engine (foundation)
        1.2.2  Develop Document Generator (core engine)
        1.2.3  Develop REST API Server (basic structure)
        1.2.4  Develop CLI Interface (basic commands)

    1.3 **Database & Configuration Management:**
        1.3.1  Design database schema (JSON configuration initially)
        1.3.2  Implement configuration management system (.env files)
        1.3.3  Develop data migration strategy


    1.4 **Testing & Quality Assurance:**
        1.4.1  Develop unit tests for core modules
        1.4.2  Implement integration tests
        1.4.3  Conduct code reviews


    1.5 **Documentation:**
        1.5.1  Create initial technical documentation
        1.5.2  Develop API specifications (TypeSpec)


## 4. Work Package Guidelines

Each work package within the WBS will adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Clearly Defined Scope:**  A concise description of the work to be performed.
* **Measurable Outcomes:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria for completion.
* **Assignable Responsibility:**  Clearly assigned to a specific individual or team.
* **Estimated Duration:**  A realistic estimate of the time required for completion (using story points or hours).
* **Dependencies:** Identification of any preceding tasks or milestones.


## 5. Quality Control

Throughout the WBS creation and execution, quality control will be maintained through:

* **Regular Reviews:**  Stakeholder reviews at the end of each phase to validate progress and address any issues.
* **Compliance Checks:**  Ensuring adherence to coding standards, design principles, and project requirements.
* **Testing:**  Rigorous testing at all levels (unit, integration, system) to ensure functionality and performance.
* **Documentation:**  Maintaining up-to-date documentation throughout the project lifecycle.


## 6.  Tools & Technologies

The project will leverage the following tools and technologies for WBS management:

* **Project Management Software:**  (e.g., Jira, Asana, Trello)  Selection will depend on team preference and existing infrastructure.
* **Version Control:** Git (GitHub) for tracking code changes and collaboration.
* **Documentation Tools:**  (e.g., Confluence, Notion) for creating and managing project documentation.


This WBS will be a living document, subject to updates and revisions as the project progresses and new information becomes available.  The iterative nature of the phased approach allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing circumstances.
