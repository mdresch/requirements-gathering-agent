# Create WBS Process for Project Backup Vermigerous

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) creation process for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on the automation and secure recovery of monthly backups.  The goal is to ensure reliable and readily available backups for system restoration in case of failure. Backups are categorized by year and month.

## 2. Process Overview

This project utilizes a phased approach to WBS creation, ensuring a structured and manageable decomposition of tasks.

**Phase 1: Planning & Design**

1. **Define Project Scope:** Finalize the scope of the backup process, including data sources, backup frequency, retention policy, and recovery objectives. (Responsible: Project Manager)
2. **Identify Major Deliverables:** Define the key components of the backup system, such as automated backup scheduling, incremental/differential backup strategy, validation and integrity checks, secure storage, metadata tagging, automated recovery testing, and monitoring & alerting. (Responsible: Architect/Lead Engineer)
3. **Technology Selection:** Choose appropriate technologies for automation (cron jobs, Azure Automation, PowerShell), storage (Azure Blob Storage with WORM), encryption (AES-256, TLS), and monitoring (Azure Monitor). (Responsible: Architect/Lead Engineer)

**Phase 2: Development & Implementation**

1. **Develop Automated Backup Script:** Create a robust and reliable script (e.g., PowerShell) to automate the monthly backup process, incorporating incremental/differential backups and checksum generation. (Responsible: Development Team)
2. **Implement Secure Storage:** Configure Azure Blob Storage with WORM policies and encryption at rest and in transit.  Implement multi-region replication for disaster recovery. (Responsible: DevOps Team)
3. **Develop Metadata Tagging System:** Implement a system to automatically tag backups with project name, year, month, and version.  Store metadata in a centralized index (e.g., JSON or database). (Responsible: Development Team)
4. **Develop Automated Recovery Testing Script:** Create a script to automate the restoration of backups in a sandbox environment and log/alert on failures. (Responsible: Development Team)
5. **Implement Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrate with Azure Monitor to track backup status and set up alerts for failures, delays, or storage thresholds. (Responsible: DevOps Team)

**Phase 3: Testing & Deployment**

1. **Unit Testing:** Test individual components of the backup system (script, storage, metadata, recovery, monitoring). (Responsible: Development Team)
2. **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between different components of the backup system. (Responsible: QA Team)
3. **System Testing:** Test the entire backup system end-to-end, including backup, storage, recovery, and monitoring. (Responsible: QA Team)
4. **Deployment:** Deploy the complete backup system to the production environment. (Responsible: DevOps Team)

**Phase 4: Maintenance & Support**

1. **Ongoing Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the backup system for performance and issues. (Responsible: DevOps Team)
2. **Regular Maintenance:** Perform regular maintenance tasks, such as log cleanup and storage optimization. (Responsible: DevOps Team)
3. **System Updates:** Apply updates and patches to the backup system as needed. (Responsible: DevOps Team)

## 4. Work Package Guidelines

Each work package should be clearly defined with specific deliverables, timelines, assigned resources, and acceptance criteria.  The duration of each work package should be estimated and tracked.

## 5. Quality Control

Regular reviews and testing throughout the project lifecycle are crucial for ensuring the quality of the backup system.  This includes adherence to the defined scope, successful completion of testing phases, and stakeholder sign-off at each key milestone.  Automated testing and monitoring will play a significant role in maintaining quality.
