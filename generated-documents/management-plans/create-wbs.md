# Create WBS Process for Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) creation process for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The RGA project aims to develop a revolutionary AI-powered system for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This WBS ensures a structured approach to development, facilitating efficient task management, resource allocation, and progress tracking.  The unique aspects of this project, including the integration of multiple AI providers and the generation of diverse document types, are considered throughout this process.

## 2. Process Overview

The WBS creation will follow an iterative, top-down decomposition approach.  This involves progressively breaking down the project into smaller, more manageable work packages.  Stakeholder involvement is crucial at each stage to ensure alignment and accuracy.

**Key Steps:**

1. **Define Project Scope Baseline:**  Utilize the existing project documentation (including `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, and other relevant documents) to clearly define the project scope, objectives, and deliverables.  This will serve as the foundation for WBS decomposition.

2. **Identify Major Deliverables:** Based on the project scope, identify the primary deliverables.  These will likely include the core application components (Context Management System, AI Provider Integration, Document Generation Engine, CLI Interface), supporting infrastructure (API, database, testing framework), and associated documentation (user guides, API documentation).

3. **Hierarchical Decomposition:**  Systematically decompose each major deliverable into progressively smaller sub-deliverables and work packages.  This hierarchical structure will ensure a clear understanding of dependencies and task relationships.  The level of detail should be sufficient to assign tasks to individuals or teams, estimate effort, and track progress.

4. **Create Work Packages:**  Define clear, concise work packages for each leaf node in the WBS.  Each work package should meet the criteria outlined in Section 4.  Consider using a consistent naming convention for work packages (e.g.,  `[Deliverable]-[Sub-deliverable]-[Task ID]`).

5. **Stakeholder Validation:**  Present the draft WBS to key stakeholders (development team, product owner, architecture team, testing team) for review and approval.  Iterate on the WBS based on stakeholder feedback to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## 3. Decomposition Approach

The WBS will employ a hierarchical structure, typically represented visually as a tree diagram.  The following levels are anticipated:

* **Level 1: Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)
* **Level 2: Major Deliverables:**  Context Management System, AI Provider Integration, Document Generation Engine, CLI Interface, API Development, Testing & QA, Documentation, Deployment
* **Level 3: Sub-deliverables:**  Further breakdown of Level 2 deliverables (e.g., for "AI Provider Integration," sub-deliverables might include "OpenAI Integration," "Google AI Integration," "Ollama Integration," etc.).
* **Level 4: Work Packages:**  Specific tasks within sub-deliverables (e.g., "Develop OpenAI API connection," "Implement error handling for Google AI," "Write unit tests for Ollama integration").


## 4. Work Package Guidelines

Each work package should adhere to the following guidelines:

* **Clearly Defined Scope:**  A precise description of the work to be performed.
* **Measurable Outcomes:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria to determine completion.
* **Assignable to Single Responsibility:**  Clearly assigned to a specific individual or team.
* **Appropriate Duration:**  Estimated duration of 8-80 hours (adjust as needed based on project complexity).
* **Dependencies:**  Identification of any dependencies on other work packages.


## 5. Quality Control

The WBS will undergo rigorous quality control to ensure accuracy and completeness.

**Validation Criteria:**

* **100% Rule Compliance:**  All work packages collectively encompass the entire project scope.
* **Mutually Exclusive Elements:**  Work packages should not overlap in scope.
* **Appropriate Level of Detail:**  Sufficient detail to support planning and execution.
* **Stakeholder Approval:**  Formal sign-off from key stakeholders.

## 6. Tools and Techniques

The project will utilize project management software (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) to manage the WBS and track progress.  Regular reviews and updates will be conducted throughout the project lifecycle to ensure the WBS remains aligned with project realities.


This WBS creation process, tailored to the specific requirements of the RGA project, ensures a structured and efficient approach to development, ultimately leading to the successful delivery of a high-quality, AI-powered project documentation generation system.
