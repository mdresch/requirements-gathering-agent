# Risk Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Risk Management Plan outlines the approach for identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring risks throughout the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project lifecycle.  The goal is to proactively mitigate potential threats and capitalize on opportunities to ensure project success, on time and within budget. This plan adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.

**2. Methodology and Approach**

A qualitative risk analysis approach will be primarily used, supplemented by quantitative analysis where appropriate (e.g., for critical risks with significant potential impact).  The plan employs a risk-driven approach, focusing efforts on the highest-priority risks.  A combination of brainstorming, SWOT analysis, checklist reviews, and expert judgment will be used for risk identification.

**3. Roles and Responsibilities**

| Role                  | Responsibility                                                                                             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager        | Overall risk management, plan development, risk response implementation, and monitoring.                  |
| Development Team Lead | Identification of technical risks and participation in risk assessment and response planning.             |
| Stakeholders           | Identification of risks related to requirements, acceptance criteria, and project scope.            |
| QA/Testing Team       | Identification of risks related to testing, quality assurance, and validation.                          |


**4. Risk Categories and Breakdown Structure**

Risks will be categorized using a hierarchical structure:

* **Project Risks:**
    * **Scope Risks:**  Unclear requirements, scope creep, changes in user needs.
    * **Schedule Risks:** Delays in development, testing, or deployment.  Dependency on third-party APIs.
    * **Cost Risks:** Unexpected expenses, exceeding budget allocations.  Changes in pricing of AI services.
    * **Quality Risks:** Bugs, performance issues, security vulnerabilities.  Inaccurate document generation.
    * **Resource Risks:**  Shortage of skilled developers, loss of key personnel.  Increased demand for AI resources.
    * **Communication Risks:** Poor communication among team members, stakeholders, or users.
    * **External Risks:** Changes in market conditions, regulatory changes, competition.


* **Technical Risks:**
    * **API Integration Risks:** Failures in integrating with AI APIs (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub, Ollama).
    * **AI Model Limitations:** Inconsistent or inaccurate outputs from the AI models.
    * **Data Security Risks:** Breaches of user data or API keys.
    * **Scalability Risks:** Inability to handle large project contexts or high usage volume.
    * **Technology Risks:** Obsolescence of used technologies, compatibility issues.


* **Stakeholder Risks:**
    * **Requirement Conflicts:** Conflicting requirements from different stakeholders.
    * **Lack of Stakeholder Engagement:** Insufficient participation from stakeholders.
    * **Decision Delays:** Delays in obtaining approvals or feedback from stakeholders.


**5. Risk Probability and Impact Definitions**

Risk probability and impact will be assessed using a qualitative scale:

| Probability | Description                               | Impact     | Description                                           |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| High         | Very likely to occur                     | High        | Significant negative impact on project objectives      |
| Medium       | Moderately likely to occur                | Medium      | Moderate negative impact on project objectives       |
| Low          | Unlikely to occur                         | Low         | Minor negative impact on project objectives          |


**6. Risk Tolerance Thresholds**

The project will have zero tolerance for high-probability/high-impact risks.  Medium-probability/high-impact risks require immediate mitigation strategies. Low-probability/high-impact risks will be monitored.

**7. Risk Documentation Approach**

A risk register will be maintained, documenting identified risks, their probability and impact, response strategies, owners, and status.  The register will be updated regularly throughout the project.  The risk register will be a living document accessible to all stakeholders.

**8. Risk Identification Techniques**

* Brainstorming sessions
* SWOT analysis
* Checklist reviews (using PMBOK guidelines and past project experience)
* Expert judgment from team members and stakeholders
* Document review (README, Requirements, Architecture documentation)

**9. Risk Analysis Approach**

* **Qualitative Risk Analysis:**  A probability and impact matrix will be used to assess the likelihood and severity of each risk.
* **Quantitative Risk Analysis:**  Decision tree analysis or Monte Carlo simulation may be used for high-priority risks where more precise assessment is needed.

**10. Risk Response Strategies**

The following strategies will be used to address identified risks:

* **Avoidance:** Eliminate the risk altogether by changing the project plan.
* **Mitigation:** Reduce the probability or impact of the risk.
* **Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
* **Acceptance:** Accept the risk and its potential consequences.  Contingency plans may be developed.

**11. Risk Monitoring Approach**

Risks will be monitored throughout the project lifecycle. Regular risk reviews will be conducted to identify new risks, assess the status of existing risks, and adjust response strategies as necessary.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) will be tracked to gauge the effectiveness of risk mitigation efforts.

**12. Risk Communication Plan**

A communication plan will be established to ensure that all stakeholders are informed about identified risks, their potential impact, and the mitigation strategies being implemented.  Regular updates will be provided through meetings, emails, and the risk register.

**13. Risk Timing**

Risk identification and analysis will be performed during project initiation and planning.  Ongoing risk monitoring will occur throughout the execution and closure phases.

**14. Risk Tracking and Auditing**

The risk register will be the primary tool for tracking risks.  Regular audits will be conducted to ensure that the risk management process is effective and that mitigation strategies are being implemented as planned.


This Risk Management Plan is a living document and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring that this plan is followed and that risks are effectively managed.
