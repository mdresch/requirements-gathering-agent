## Direct and Manage Project Work: Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the Direct and Manage Project Work process for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan leverages the project's existing documentation and leverages the project's self-documenting nature.

**1. Project Scope and Objectives:**

The project scope encompasses the development and maintenance of the Requirements Gathering Agent, a CLI tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI.  Key objectives include:

* Achieve and maintain a high weekly download rate on NPM.
* Deliver a stable, reliable, and user-friendly tool.
* Ensure PMBOK 7.0 compliance in generated documents.
* Support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
* Continuously improve the tool based on user feedback and technological advancements.

**2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

The WBS will be dynamically updated, reflecting the iterative nature of the project.  However, key work packages include:

* **1.0 Requirements Management:**  Refinement of existing requirements based on user feedback and identified bugs.  This includes prioritizing features for future sprints.
* **2.0 Development:** This encompasses bug fixes, enhancements (e.g., improved context management, additional AI provider support), and new feature implementation (e.g., direct context injection).
* **3.0 Testing:** Unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) will be performed iteratively throughout development.  This includes automated tests and manual testing.
* **4.0 Deployment:**  Release management, versioning, and deployment to NPM.
* **5.0 Documentation:** Update existing documentation to reflect changes and enhancements.  This includes the README, CHANGELOG, and other relevant documents.
* **6.0 Stakeholder Management:** Monitoring user feedback, addressing issues, and engaging with the community.

**3. Resource Management:**

* **Human Resources:** The core development team, potentially augmented with contractors for specific tasks (e.g., UI/UX improvements).
* **Material Resources:** Access to AI APIs (costs associated with usage), cloud infrastructure (if applicable), and software development tools.

**4. Schedule Management:**

The project will utilize an iterative, agile approach with short sprints (e.g., 2-week sprints).  A sprint backlog will be maintained, prioritizing tasks based on value and risk.  The schedule will be tracked using a project management tool (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps).  The milestone of 175 weekly downloads provides a key performance indicator to monitor progress.

**5. Cost Management:**

Costs will be tracked based on resource allocation (salaries, API costs, cloud infrastructure).  A budget will be established and monitored regularly.

**6. Quality Management:**

Quality assurance will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle. This includes:

* **Code Reviews:** Peer reviews of code changes to ensure quality and adherence to coding standards.
* **Automated Testing:** Unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and prevent regressions.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Feedback from users to validate the tool's usability and effectiveness.
* **PMBOK Compliance Validation:**  Regular checks to ensure generated documents meet PMBOK 7.0 standards.

**7. Communication Management:**

Communication will be facilitated through:

* **GitHub:**  Issue tracking, pull requests, and code collaboration.
* **NPM:**  Release announcements and updates.
* **Community Engagement:**  Responding to user feedback and questions.
* **Internal Team Communication:** Regular sprint meetings and progress updates.

**8. Risk Management:**

Potential risks include:

* **API Cost Overruns:**  Monitoring API usage and adjusting usage patterns as needed.
* **AI Model Limitations:**  Addressing limitations in AI capabilities through improved context management and fallback mechanisms.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:**  Regular security audits and updates to address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Lack of User Adoption:**  Proactive community engagement and marketing efforts to increase adoption.

**9. Procurement Management:** (If applicable)  This section would detail any external services or resources required.

**10. Monitoring and Controlling:**

Progress will be monitored using various metrics, including:

* **Sprint Velocity:**  Tracking the amount of work completed per sprint.
* **Bug Resolution Rate:**  Monitoring the number of bugs identified and resolved.
* **NPM Downloads:**  Tracking weekly download numbers.
* **User Feedback:**  Analyzing user feedback to identify areas for improvement.

Regular progress reports will be generated and distributed to stakeholders.  Corrective actions will be taken as needed to address deviations from the plan.


This Direct and Manage Project Work plan provides a framework for managing the Requirements Gathering Agent project. The iterative nature of the project will necessitate ongoing adaptation and refinement of this plan.  The existing documentation serves as a valuable resource, outlining many aspects of this plan.
