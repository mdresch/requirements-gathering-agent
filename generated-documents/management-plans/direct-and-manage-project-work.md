## 3. **Execution Activities**  

### 3.1 **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
The WBS breaks down the project into manageable components:  

#### Level 1: **Project Execution**  
1. **Project Charter Development**  
   - Generate a PMBOK-compliant Project Charter using AI.  
   - Validate charter quality using PMBOK 7.0 compliance checks.  

2. **Core PMBOK Document Generation**  
   - Produce stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk plans, and communication plans.  
   - Validate generated documents for consistency and compliance.  

3. **Enhanced Context Manager Implementation**  
   - Optimize context management to utilize 20–90% token capacity for large models like Gemini 1.5 Pro.  
   - Conduct thorough testing of the 3-phase context strategy.  

4. **Interactive AI Provider Selection**  
   - Develop and integrate a CLI-based provider choice menu.  
   - Test provider synchronization and fallback mechanisms for seamless UX.  

5. **Testing & Validation**  
   - Perform quality assurance tests for generated documents.  
   - Run PMBOK compliance validation and resolve issues.  

#### Level 2: **Stakeholder Engagement**  
1. **Stakeholder Requirements Analysis**  
   - Conduct workshops to gather functional and non-functional requirements.  
   - Confirm alignment between stakeholder expectations and project deliverables.  

2. **Stakeholder Communication**  
   - Regular updates using the Communication Management Plan.  
   - Share milestone reports (e.g., 175 weekly downloads) with stakeholders.  

#### Level 3: **Risk Management**  
1. **Risk Identification and Mitigation**  
   - Identify risks such as context overflow or provider integration failures.  
   - Develop contingency plans (e.g., fallback mechanisms for AI provider failure).  

2. **Monitoring and Controlling Risks**  
   - Track risk triggers and thresholds using the Risk Register.  
   - Implement risk responses as defined in the Risk Management Plan.
