# Direct and Manage Project Work for ADPA

This document outlines the approach to directing and managing project work for the Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (ADPA) project, aligning with the PMBOK 7th Edition.  Given ADPA's nature as a software framework with significant AI integration, the plan emphasizes iterative development, agile methodologies, and continuous monitoring.

**1. Project Governance:**

* **Steering Committee:** A steering committee composed of key stakeholders (e.g., business sponsors, technical leads, and representatives from target user groups) will provide high-level guidance and decision-making authority.  The committee will meet regularly (e.g., monthly) to review progress, address risks, and approve significant changes.
* **Project Manager:**  The Project Manager will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project, ensuring adherence to the project plan, managing the project team, and reporting progress to the steering committee.
* **Decision-Making Process:** A clear RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix will be established to define roles and responsibilities for all project decisions.  Escalation paths will be defined for resolving conflicts and addressing critical issues.

**2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

The project will utilize an iterative WBS, reflecting the agile development approach.  The initial WBS will focus on key milestones and deliverables, with subsequent iterations refining the WBS as the project progresses. Example high-level WBS elements:

* **Phase 1: Core Framework Development:**
    * Develop core API (including TypeSpec generation).
    * Implement CLI interface.
    * Integrate with chosen AI providers (Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).
    * Establish basic authentication and authorization.
* **Phase 2: Integration & Enhancement:**
    * Integrate with Confluence and SharePoint.
    * Implement Adobe Document Services integration.
    * Develop the admin web interface (Next.js).
    * Implement advanced features (e.g., workflow automation).
* **Phase 3: Testing & Deployment:**
    * Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, performance).
    * Deployment to production environment.
    * Post-launch monitoring and support.


**3. Project Schedule:**

The project will follow an iterative schedule aligned with agile sprints.  Each sprint will have clearly defined goals and deliverables.  The overall project schedule will be tracked using a suitable project management tool (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps). The schedule will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect actual progress and any necessary adjustments.  A Gantt chart will visualize the schedule, highlighting dependencies and critical path activities.

**4. Resource Management:**

* **Team Composition:** The project team will include developers, testers, business analysts, and a dedicated project manager.  Roles and responsibilities will be clearly defined.
* **Resource Allocation:** Resources will be allocated to sprints based on capacity and skillsets.  Resource leveling techniques will be employed to ensure optimal resource utilization.
* **Time Tracking:**  Time tracking will be mandatory to monitor individual and team productivity, allowing for accurate cost and schedule management.

**5. Risk Management:**

A comprehensive risk register will be maintained, identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies.  Risks will be categorized by probability and impact, and prioritized accordingly.  Regular risk reviews will be conducted to monitor emerging risks and adjust mitigation plans.  Key risks include:

* **AI Provider API Changes:**  Mitigation: Establish robust monitoring and contingency plans for API changes.
* **Integration Challenges:** Mitigation:  Thorough testing and dedicated integration specialists.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Mitigation:  Penetration testing and security audits.

**6. Quality Management:**

* **Quality Assurance Plan:** A detailed quality assurance plan will be established, defining testing procedures, acceptance criteria, and defect tracking mechanisms.
* **Code Reviews:** Regular code reviews will be conducted to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
* **Automated Testing:**  Automated tests will be implemented to ensure consistent and efficient testing.

**7. Communication Management:**

Regular communication will be maintained with stakeholders through various channels, including:

* **Steering Committee Meetings:**  Monthly meetings to review progress and address concerns.
* **Team Meetings:** Daily stand-up meetings for progress updates and issue resolution.
* **Progress Reports:** Regular written reports to stakeholders.
* **Project Management Tool:**  Centralized platform for tracking progress, risks, and issues.

**8. Procurement Management (if applicable):**

This section would detail any necessary procurement activities, including vendor selection, contract negotiation, and vendor management.  Given the reliance on cloud-based AI providers, this might include contract management for API usage and service level agreements.

**9. Stakeholder Management:**

Active stakeholder management will be crucial, ensuring ongoing engagement and communication with all relevant parties.  A stakeholder register will be maintained, outlining key stakeholders, their interests, and communication preferences.

**10. Project Closure:**

Upon completion of all project deliverables and acceptance by stakeholders, a formal project closure process will be initiated. This includes final reporting, documentation archiving, and lessons learned capture.


This plan provides a framework for directing and managing the ADPA project.  The plan will be iteratively refined throughout the project lifecycle, adapting to changing circumstances and incorporating lessons learned.  Regular monitoring and control mechanisms will ensure that the project stays on track, within budget, and delivers the desired outcomes.
