## Direct and Manage Project Work Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This plan outlines the approach to direct and manage project work for the Requirements Gathering Agent, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  It leverages the provided project context, including the README and associated documentation.

**1. Project Scope Management:**

* **Project Scope Statement:**  The scope is defined by the README, encompassing the development, testing, and release of an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation. This includes core functionality (document generation), enhanced features (context management, validation), and ongoing maintenance based on user feedback and identified issues.  The project scope excludes integration with specific third-party PM tools (initially), although this is identified as a future enhancement.

* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project work will be created.  Example work packages include:
    * **Requirements Gathering & Analysis:** Refining existing requirements, addressing outstanding issues.
    * **AI Model Integration:**  Implementing and testing integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.
    * **Context Management System Development:**  Refining the 3-phase context strategy and implementing improvements.
    * **Document Generation Engine Enhancement:** Adding new document types (e.g., Project KickOff checklist) and modularizing the processor architecture.
    * **CLI Enhancements:** Implementing the interactive provider selection menu.
    * **Testing & Quality Assurance:** Unit, integration, and system testing, including PMBOK validation.
    * **Documentation Updates:** Updating existing documentation and creating new documentation as needed.
    * **Release Management:** Preparing and deploying the updated version to npm.

* **Scope Baseline:** The approved WBS and project scope statement will form the scope baseline against which changes will be managed.  A formal Change Control Process (see below) will be implemented.

**2. Project Schedule Management:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed schedule will be created, outlining tasks, dependencies, durations, and resource assignments.  Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum or Kanban) will be considered, given the iterative nature of development and the need for frequent feedback.

* **Critical Path Analysis:** The critical path will be identified to highlight tasks requiring close monitoring to avoid delays.

* **Schedule Baseline:** The approved project schedule will serve as the schedule baseline.

**3. Project Cost Management:**

* **Cost Estimation:**  Costs will be estimated for resources (developer time, cloud services, testing), and contingency reserves will be included.

* **Budget:** An approved budget will be established based on the cost estimates.

* **Cost Baseline:** The approved budget will be the cost baseline.

**4. Project Quality Management:**

* **Quality Metrics:**  Metrics will include code coverage, test pass rate, user feedback, and PMBOK compliance scores.

* **Quality Control:** Regular code reviews, testing, and validation will be conducted.

* **Quality Assurance:**  The PMBOK validation feature will ensure the generated documents meet quality standards.

**5. Project Resource Management:**

* **Resource Planning:** Resources (developers, testers) will be identified and allocated to tasks based on their skills and availability.

* **Resource Leveling:**  Resource allocation will be optimized to avoid over-allocation and resource conflicts.

**6. Project Communications Management:**

* **Communication Plan:** A communication plan will define communication methods, frequency, and stakeholders.  This will include regular updates, issue tracking, and feedback mechanisms.

* **Stakeholder Engagement:**  Regular communication with stakeholders will be maintained to ensure alignment and address concerns.

**7. Project Risk Management:**

* **Risk Register:**  Potential risks (e.g., API limitations, unexpected bugs, delays in AI model integration) will be identified and documented in a risk register.

* **Risk Response Planning:**  Mitigation strategies will be developed for identified risks.

**8. Project Procurement Management (if applicable):**

*  This project primarily uses existing cloud services (Azure OpenAI, etc.).  If additional services or tools are required, a procurement process will be followed.

**9. Project Stakeholder Management:**

* **Stakeholder Register:** The stakeholder register will be maintained and updated throughout the project to reflect changing needs and expectations.

* **Stakeholder Engagement:**  Active engagement with stakeholders (developers, users, PMBOK experts) will be maintained through regular communication and feedback loops.


**10. Change Management:**

* **Change Control Process:** A formal change control process will be implemented to manage changes to the scope, schedule, and budget.  All change requests will be documented, assessed, approved/rejected, and tracked.


**11. Project Monitoring and Controlling:**

* **Performance Reporting:**  Regular progress reports will be generated, tracking progress against the baseline and identifying any deviations.  These reports will include earned value management (EVM) metrics where appropriate.

* **Issue Tracking:**  Issues will be tracked and resolved using a suitable issue tracking system.

* **Corrective Actions:**  Corrective actions will be taken to address any deviations from the baseline.


This plan provides a framework for directing and managing the project work.  Specific details will be further elaborated in the project's detailed management plan documents generated by the tool itself. The iterative nature of the project will allow for adjustments to the plan as new information becomes available and priorities shift.
