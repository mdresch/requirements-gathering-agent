# Direct and Manage Project Work

**Project:** ADPA â€“ Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Document Owner:** Project Manager  
**Last Updated:** July 2025

---

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines how project work is directed and managed for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project, according to PMBOK 7th Edition best practices. It describes the processes, tools, responsibilities, and actions required to produce deliverables, achieve project objectives, and ensure alignment with enterprise standards.

---

## 2. Project Overview

ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant automation framework designed to accelerate and standardize the generation of business, project, and data management documentation. It leverages multi-provider AI (OpenAI, Google, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) and offers both CLI and REST API interaction modes. ADPA outputs documentation compliant with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 standards and provides deep enterprise integration (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services).

## 3. Direct and Manage Project Work Process

### 3.1 Initiation & Planning

- **Project Charter & Scope:** Established based on PMBOK guidelines, with compliance objectives defined for BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Identified enterprise architects, business analysts, compliance officers, and IT operations as key stakeholders.
- **Roadmap Alignment:** All activities are mapped to quarterly milestones (see Roadmap section in README).

### 3.2 Execution

#### a. Deliverable Production

- **AI-Powered Document Generation:**  
  - Use ADPA CLI/API to generate project charters, stakeholder analyses, business cases, and compliance reports.
  - Employ template-based workflows to ensure standardization and traceability.
  - AI provider selection is managed via configuration or interactive menu (see Implementation Guide).
- **Framework Compliance:**  
  - Each generated document is automatically checked against relevant standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
  - Deviation analysis APIs (e.g., Standards Compliance API) are used to identify and report on compliance gaps.
- **Integration Flows:**  
  - Documents are published directly to Confluence and SharePoint via secure OAuth2 integrations.
  - Adobe Document Services are used for advanced PDF/inDesign/Illustrator output.

#### b. Technical Operations

- **Configuration Management:**  
  - Environment setup via `.env` files and documented CLI scripts (see README: Installation & Configuration).
  - AI provider credentials managed securely.
- **API & Web Server Management:**  
  - Production Express.js API server is started and monitored per documented procedures.
  - Admin web interface is deployed for project oversight.
- **Testing & Quality Assurance:**  
  - Automated Jest test suites run for every build (unit, integration, provider-specific, performance).
  - Manual testing performed for new integrations (e.g., Azure API Center, Adobe SDK).
- **Version Control:**  
  - All code and document templates managed in GitHub with conventional commit standards.
  - Changes are peer-reviewed and tracked for audit compliance.

#### c. Support & Communication

- **Documentation:**  
  - All features and workflows are documented in the GitHub Wiki and `docs/` directory.
- **Issue & Change Management:**  
  - Issues are tracked in GitHub Issues.
  - Community and enterprise support channels are monitored for feedback and incident management.
- **Contribution Management:**  
  - External contributions follow documented standards (Prettier, ESLint, Conventional Commits).

## 4. Unique Aspects of ADPA Project Execution

- **Standards-Driven Automation:** Every deliverable is mapped to internationally recognized frameworks, ensuring auditability and regulatory alignment.
- **Multi-Provider AI Orchestration:** ADPA supports dynamic failover and selection across AI providers, offering resilience and flexibility.
- **Enterprise Integration-First:** Direct, tested integrations with SharePoint, Confluence, and Adobe allow for real-world, production-grade deployment.
- **API-First Microservices:** All capabilities are exposed as RESTful APIs with OpenAPI/TypeSpec documentation, supporting both automation and interactive use.
- **Security & Compliance:** Built-in authentication (OAuth2, API keys, JWT), enterprise security middleware, and adherence to standards like GDPR, SOX, and PCI DSS.
- **Performance & Scalability:** Microservices architecture, caching, and load balancing are implemented for high-availability, horizontal scaling, and enterprise readiness.
- **Contribution and Community:** Open source, with a documented path for contributors to align with code standards and project vision.
