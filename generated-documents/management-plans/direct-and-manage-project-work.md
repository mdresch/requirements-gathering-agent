# Direct and Manage Project Work: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Project Overview:**

Project Backup Vermigerous is responsible for automating the monthly backup process and validating the integrity of backups for critical project data. The goal is to ensure sufficient backups are available for restoration in case of system failure. Backups are categorized by year and month.  This document outlines the plan to direct and manage the work required to improve the existing backup process focusing on automation and secure recovery.

**2. Project Objectives:**

* Automate the monthly backup schedule.
* Implement incremental or differential backups to reduce storage space and backup time.
* Ensure data integrity through automated validation and checksum generation.
* Securely store backups using encryption and immutable storage.
* Implement automated recovery testing.
* Establish monitoring and alerting for backup failures and storage thresholds.

**3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

The project will be broken down into the following tasks:

* **Task 1: Automated Backup Scheduling:**
    * Sub-task 1.1: Select and configure backup scheduling tool (cron jobs, Azure Automation, PowerShell).
    * Sub-task 1.2: Develop scripts to automate the backup process.
    * Sub-task 1.3: Test automated scheduling.
* **Task 2: Incremental/Differential Backups:**
    * Sub-task 2.1: Research and select appropriate backup strategy (incremental or differential).
    * Sub-task 2.2: Implement chosen strategy in backup scripts.
    * Sub-task 2.3: Test incremental/differential backup functionality.
* **Task 3: Validation and Integrity Checks:**
    * Sub-task 3.1: Implement checksum generation (SHA-256).
    * Sub-task 3.2: Develop validation scripts to compare checksums.
    * Sub-task 3.3: Integrate validation into the backup process.
    * Sub-task 3.4: Test integrity checks.
* **Task 4: Secure Storage Architecture:**
    * Sub-task 4.1: Configure Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy.
    * Sub-task 4.2: Implement AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS encryption in transit.
    * Sub-task 4.3: Configure multi-region replication.
    * Sub-task 4.4: Test secure storage functionality.
* **Task 5: Metadata Tagging and Categorization:**
    * Sub-task 5.1: Design metadata schema.
    * Sub-task 5.2: Implement metadata tagging in backup scripts.
    * Sub-task 5.3: Develop a centralized metadata index (JSON or database).
    * Sub-task 5.4: Test metadata tagging and retrieval.
* **Task 6: Automated Recovery Testing:**
    * Sub-task 6.1: Set up a sandbox environment.
    * Sub-task 6.2: Develop scripts for automated restore testing.
    * Sub-task 6.3: Implement logging and alerting for restore failures.
    * Sub-task 6.4: Schedule and execute automated recovery tests.
* **Task 7: Monitoring and Alerting:**
    * Sub-task 7.1: Integrate with Azure Monitor or similar monitoring tools.
    * Sub-task 7.2: Configure alerts for failures, delays, and storage thresholds.
    * Sub-task 7.3: Test monitoring and alerting system.

**4. Resource Allocation:**

* **Personnel:**  [List team members and their roles]
* **Tools:**  [List software and hardware resources]
* **Budget:** [Provide a budget breakdown]

**5. Schedule:**

[Insert Gantt chart or other schedule visualization here.  This should show task dependencies and deadlines.]

**6. Risk Management:**

* **Risk 1:** Failure to automate the backup process.  **Mitigation:** Thorough testing and contingency plans.
* **Risk 2:** Data corruption during backup or restoration.  **Mitigation:** Robust validation and checksum verification.
* **Risk 3:** Security breaches. **Mitigation:** Encryption, immutable storage, and regular security audits.
* **Risk 4:**  Azure service disruptions. **Mitigation:** Multi-region replication and disaster recovery plan.


**7. Communication Plan:**

Regular status meetings will be held [frequency].  Progress reports will be provided [frequency].  Issues will be escalated as needed.

**8. Quality Assurance:**

Thorough testing will be conducted at each stage of the project.  This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.

**9. Project Closure:**

The project will be considered complete when all objectives have been met and the automated backup system is fully operational and validated.  A post-project review will be conducted to document lessons learned.


This document serves as a high-level plan.  More detailed task descriptions and specifications will be created as the project progresses.
