## Define Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent Project (PMBOK 7th Edition)

This Define Scope process outlines the steps to clearly define the project scope for the Requirements Gathering Agent, aligning with PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The process leverages the existing project documentation (README, etc.) and incorporates iterative stakeholder engagement.

**1. Plan Scope Management:**

* **1.1 Inputs:** Project Charter (already exists), Stakeholder Register (implied, needs refinement), Enterprise Environmental Factors (PMBOK standards, Azure OpenAI API limitations), Organizational Process Assets (best practices for scope definition).
* **1.2 Outputs:** Scope Management Plan (detailed below). This plan will detail how the scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.  It will specify methods for managing changes and resolving scope creep.
* **1.3 Activities:**  Review the existing project documentation (README, Milestone Report, etc.) to establish a preliminary understanding of the project scope.  Identify key stakeholders (developers, PMO, users) and their roles in the scope definition process. Develop a communication plan for stakeholder engagement.  Define the scope management approach (iterative, incremental, etc.).


**2. Collect Requirements:**

* **2.1 Inputs:** Project Charter, Preliminary Scope Definition (from step 1.3), Stakeholder Register (refined), Scope Management Plan.
* **2.2 Outputs:**  Requirements Documentation (a comprehensive list of functional and non-functional requirements).  This will include detailed descriptions of the features, functionalities, and constraints of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  This should be organized using a requirements traceability matrix to link requirements to deliverables.
* **2.3 Activities:** Employ various requirements elicitation techniques:
    * **Review existing documentation:**  Thoroughly analyze the existing README, CHANGELOG, and other documentation to capture existing requirements.
    * **Stakeholder Interviews:** Conduct interviews with key stakeholders to gather their needs and expectations.
    * **Surveys/Questionnaires:**  Use surveys to gather broader feedback from a larger group of stakeholders.
    * **Workshops:** Facilitate workshops to collaboratively define and refine requirements.
    * **Prototyping:** Develop prototypes to validate requirements and gather feedback.


**3. Define Scope:**

* **3.1 Inputs:** Requirements Documentation, Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Stakeholder Register.
* **3.2 Outputs:**  Project Scope Statement (formal document defining the project boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria), WBS (Work Breakdown Structure â€“ a hierarchical decomposition of the project work).
* **3.3 Activities:**  Based on the collected requirements, develop a formal Project Scope Statement that clearly defines:
    * **Project Objectives:** What the project aims to achieve.
    * **Project Deliverables:** Specific outputs of the project (e.g., specific PMBOK documents generated).
    * **Project Boundaries:** What is included and excluded from the project.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** How success will be measured (e.g., PMBOK compliance, user acceptance testing).
    * **Constraints:** Limitations that may affect the project (e.g., budget, timeline, technology).
    * **Assumptions:** Factors assumed to be true during project planning.
    * **Risks:** Potential issues that could impact the project.


**4. Create WBS:**

* **4.1 Inputs:** Project Scope Statement.
* **4.2 Outputs:**  WBS (Work Breakdown Structure), WBS Dictionary (detailed description of each work package).
* **4.3 Activities:** Decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable work packages.  Create a hierarchical structure representing the relationships between these packages. Develop a WBS Dictionary that provides detailed descriptions, timelines, and resource assignments for each work package.


**5. Validate Scope:**

* **5.1 Inputs:** Project Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary, Requirements Documentation.
* **5.2 Outputs:** Approved Project Scope Statement, Approved WBS.
* **5.3 Activities:**  Present the Project Scope Statement and WBS to stakeholders for review and approval.  Address any concerns or discrepancies.  Formalize the approved scope statement and WBS as baseline documents.


**6. Control Scope:**

* **6.1 Inputs:** Approved Project Scope Statement, WBS, Change Management Plan (part of the overall project management plan).
* **6.2 Outputs:**  Updated Project Scope Statement (if changes are approved), Change requests, Updated WBS.
* **6.3 Activities:**  Establish a formal process for managing scope changes (change requests).  Monitor the project to detect any scope creep and implement corrective actions as needed.  Maintain the WBS and update it to reflect approved changes.


This Define Scope process, adapted to the Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensures a clear understanding of what the project will deliver and provides a framework for managing scope throughout the project lifecycle.  The iterative nature of the process, incorporating stakeholder feedback at each stage, minimizes the risk of scope creep and ensures alignment with stakeholder expectations.
