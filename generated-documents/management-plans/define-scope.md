## Define Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent Project (PMBOK 7th Edition)

This Define Scope process outlines the steps to clearly define the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensuring alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations.  It leverages the existing project documentation and README file for a comprehensive approach.

**1. Plan Scope Management:**

* **Objective:** Establish how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Charter (already exists)
    * Project Management Plan (to be created, will include this Define Scope process)
    * Enterprise Environmental Factors (relevant PMBOK standards, organizational policies, regulatory requirements)
    * Organizational Process Assets (templates, best practices from previous projects)
* **Outputs:**
    * Scope Management Plan (document detailing how scope will be managed throughout the project lifecycle)  This will include the detailed steps of this Define Scope process.
    * Requirements Management Plan (to be created in a later stage, but planning for it begins here)

**2. Collect Requirements:**

* **Objective:** Gather all necessary information related to project requirements.  This will heavily leverage the existing README and other project documentation.
* **Techniques:**
    * **Review Existing Documentation:** Thoroughly examine the project README, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `ARCHITECTURE.MD`, `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE-PROVIDER-CHOICE-MENU.MD`, `01_SCOPE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `CHANGELOG.MD`, `03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD`, and `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT_FROM_README.MD` for functional and non-functional requirements.
    * **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Conduct interviews with key stakeholders (developers, project managers, business analysts) to clarify ambiguities and gather missing requirements.  Focus on understanding their needs and expectations for the tool.
    * **Document Analysis:** Analyze the existing documentation for completeness, consistency, and potential gaps.
    * **Prototyping:** Consider creating a low-fidelity prototype of the interactive AI provider selection menu to validate user interface requirements.
* **Outputs:**
    * Requirements Traceability Matrix: A document linking requirements to their sources and planned deliverables.
    * Consolidated Requirements Document: A single, comprehensive document consolidating all gathered requirements. This document will integrate information from the existing documents and stakeholder input, potentially categorized as functional, non-functional, and constraints.

**3. Define Scope:**

* **Objective:** Create a formal project scope statement that clearly defines what is included and excluded from the project.
* **Inputs:**
    * Consolidated Requirements Document
    * Project Charter
    * Stakeholder Register (implicitly defined in existing documents)
* **Outputs:**
    * Project Scope Statement: A formal document clearly defining the project boundaries, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.  This will be a concise and unambiguous statement of what the project will deliver. The statement should include:
        * **Project Objectives:**  Clearly defined goals and expected outcomes.
        * **Project Deliverables:**  List of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) deliverables. This will include the generated PMBOK documents, the CLI tool, and the interactive menu.
        * **Project Boundaries:**  Clearly defined limits and exclusions of the project.  This will specify which types of documents will be generated and which AI providers will be supported initially.
        * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific criteria that must be met for each deliverable to be considered complete and accepted.  This includes functional and performance requirements, PMBOK compliance validation, and user acceptance testing.
        * **Exclusions:**  A list of items explicitly excluded from the project scope. This will help to prevent scope creep.
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): A hierarchical decomposition of the project work into smaller, manageable tasks. This will be created based on the project deliverables identified in the scope statement.


**4. Create WBS:**

* **Objective:** Decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable work packages.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Scope Statement
    * Organizational Process Assets
* **Outputs:**
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):  A hierarchical decomposition of the project work into smaller, manageable work packages.  This will form the basis for project planning and scheduling.
    * WBS Dictionary: A description of each work package within the WBS, including its deliverables, resources, and timelines.


**5. Validate Scope:**

* **Objective:**  Ensure that the defined scope is accurate, complete, and acceptable to all key stakeholders.
* **Techniques:**
    * **Formal Reviews:** Conduct formal reviews of the project scope statement and WBS with stakeholders to gain their approval.
    * **Walkthroughs:** Conduct walkthroughs of the WBS to ensure clarity and understanding.
* **Outputs:**
    * Approved Project Scope Statement
    * Approved WBS


**6. Control Scope:**

* **Objective:** Manage changes to the project scope throughout the project lifecycle.  This is an ongoing process.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Scope Statement
    * WBS
    * Change Requests
* **Outputs:**
    * Change Control Log: A record of all changes to the project scope, including their impact on the project schedule, cost, and resources.
    * Updated Project Scope Statement (if changes are approved)
    * Updated WBS (if changes are approved)


This process ensures a well-defined project scope, setting the stage for successful project execution.  The existing documentation provides a solid foundation for this process, minimizing the need for extensive additional requirements gathering.  The iterative nature of the process allows for adjustments based on stakeholder feedback and evolving project needs.
