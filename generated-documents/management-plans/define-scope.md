## Define Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent Project (PMBOK 7th Edition)

This process outlines how the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project will be defined, ensuring alignment with project objectives and stakeholder expectations, while adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.

**1. Plan Scope Management:**

* **Objective:** Define how the project scope will be managed throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Inputs:** Project charter (already exists), Project Management Plan (to be created), organizational process assets (existing templates, best practices), enterprise environmental factors (industry standards, regulatory compliance requirements).
* **Tools & Techniques:** Expert judgment, meetings, documentation review, data analysis of existing project documentation (README, CHANGELOG, etc.).
* **Outputs:** Scope Management Plan (detailed below).

**2. Collect Requirements:**

* **Objective:** Determine, document, and manage stakeholder needs and requirements for the project.
* **Inputs:** Project charter, stakeholder register (to be created), project documents (README, architecture documents, etc.), organizational process assets, enterprise environmental factors.
* **Tools & Techniques:** Interviews, surveys, focus groups, facilitated workshops, documentation review, brainstorming sessions, prototyping, observation, requirements traceability matrix.
* **Outputs:** Requirements documentation (functional and non-functional requirements), requirements traceability matrix, stakeholder register.  The existing README, and documents like `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `ARCHITECTURE.MD`, and `01_PROJECT_CONTEXT_FROM_README.MD`  will be used as key inputs.  Additional stakeholder interviews may be necessary to capture missing requirements.


**3. Define Scope:**

* **Objective:** Develop a detailed description of the project and product scope, including deliverables, acceptance criteria, and project boundaries.
* **Inputs:** Requirements documentation, project charter, stakeholder register, organizational process assets (PMBOK templates for scope statement), enterprise environmental factors.
* **Tools & Techniques:** Decomposition (creating WBS), expert judgment, meetings, product analysis (reviewing existing features and functionality), scope modeling.
* **Outputs:** Project Scope Statement (detailed below), Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary.  The existing `03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD` provides a good starting point, requiring refinement and alignment with the collected requirements.


**4. Create the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

* **Objective:** Subdivide the project scope into smaller, manageable components.
* **Inputs:** Project Scope Statement, organizational process assets (WBS templates).
* **Tools & Techniques:** Decomposition, mind mapping, and expert judgment.
* **Outputs:** WBS, WBS Dictionary. This will build upon the existing structure implied in the project's README and directory structure.


**5. Validate Scope:**

* **Objective:** Formalize acceptance of the defined project scope by stakeholders.
* **Inputs:** Project Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary, requirements documentation, stakeholder register.
* **Tools & Techniques:** Inspections, walkthroughs, reviews, and formal sign-off from stakeholders.
* **Outputs:** Approved Project Scope Statement, signed-off WBS.


**6. Control Scope:**

* **Objective:** Manage and control changes to the project scope throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Inputs:** Project Scope Statement, WBS, change requests, project management plan, work performance data.
* **Tools & Techniques:** Change control process, variance analysis, scope baseline, issue log, regular scope reviews.
* **Outputs:** Updated Project Scope Statement, updated WBS, change requests, project management plan updates, lessons learned.


**Detailed Scope Management Plan:**

This plan will document the above process in detail, including:

* **Roles and responsibilities:**  Who is responsible for each activity within the scope management process.
* **Process descriptions:** Step-by-step procedures for each activity.
* **Methods and techniques:** Specific tools and techniques to be used.
* **Metrics and reporting:** How scope performance will be measured and reported.
* **Change management process:** Procedures for managing scope changes (including a formal change request process).
* **Contingency plan:** Procedures to deal with unexpected scope changes.


**Detailed Project Scope Statement:**

This statement will clearly define:

* **Project objectives:**  What the project aims to achieve.
* **Project deliverables:**  Specific products and services to be produced.
* **Acceptance criteria:** How success will be measured for each deliverable.
* **Project boundaries:** What is included and excluded from the project scope.
* **Assumptions and constraints:** Factors that could affect the project.
* **Stakeholder expectations:**  What the key stakeholders expect from the project.


By following this comprehensive define scope process, the Requirements Gathering Agent project ensures a clear understanding of its scope, minimizing risks and maximizing the chances of successful project delivery.  The existing documentation provides a strong foundation, allowing for efficient refinement and validation of the scope.
