## Define Scope Process for the Requirements Gathering Agent Project (PMBOK 7th Edition)

This process outlines how the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project will be defined, following the PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The project's inherent complexity and the use of AI necessitates a robust and iterative approach.

**1. Plan Scope Management:**

* **Objective:** Define how the project scope will be managed throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Charter:  Provides high-level project goals, objectives, and constraints. (Already exists)
    * Project Management Plan:  (To be created, will include this scope management plan)
    * Enterprise Environmental Factors: Industry standards, regulatory compliance (PMBOK, etc.).
    * Organizational Process Assets: Templates, best practices, lessons learned from previous projects.
* **Outputs:**
    * Scope Management Plan: This document (detailed below).
    * Requirements Management Plan:  A separate plan detailing how requirements will be gathered, analyzed, and managed. (Already partially defined in the provided documents).

**2. Collect Requirements:**

* **Objective:** Determine, document, and manage stakeholder needs and requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Charter
    * Stakeholder Register: (Partially defined, needs further development)
    * Existing Documentation: README.md, other project documentation (already identified, needs analysis)
    * Expert Judgment: Input from developers, PMs, and other stakeholders.
* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Interviews
    * Focus Groups
    * Surveys
    * Workshops
    * Prototyping
    * Observation
    * Document Analysis (already partially done, needs completion)
* **Outputs:**
    * Requirements Documentation:  A comprehensive list of project requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and assumptions.  This will incorporate the existing README.md, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, and other relevant documents.  It will be categorized, prioritized, and uniquely identified.


**3. Define Scope:**

* **Objective:** Develop a detailed description of the project and product scope, including deliverables and acceptance criteria.
* **Inputs:**
    * Requirements Documentation (from step 2)
    * Project Charter
    * Stakeholder Register
* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Decomposition: Breaking down the project into smaller, manageable components (already partially done in the README.md document structure).
    * Prototyping: Creating a working model to validate requirements and scope.
    * Expert Judgment:  Leveraging the knowledge of experienced team members.
* **Outputs:**
    * Project Scope Statement:  A formal document defining the project boundaries, deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and constraints.  This will include:
        * Project Objectives:  Clearly stated goals to be achieved.
        * Project Deliverables:  Specific outputs of the project (e.g., software application, documentation).
        * Project Exclusions:  Clearly defined items that are explicitly NOT included in the project scope.
        * Acceptance Criteria:  Defined standards that must be met for each deliverable to be considered complete and acceptable.
        * Assumptions:  Factors believed to be true but not yet verified.
        * Constraints:  Limitations that impact the project (e.g., budget, timeline).


**4. Create Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

* **Objective:**  Decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable work packages.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Scope Statement
    * Requirements Documentation
* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Decomposition:  Hierarchical breakdown of the project into work packages.
    * WBS Dictionary:  A document providing detailed descriptions of each work package.
* **Outputs:**
    * WBS: A hierarchical decomposition of the project scope.
    * WBS Dictionary:  A descriptive document detailing each work package in the WBS.

**5. Validate Scope:**

* **Objective:**  Formalize acceptance of the defined project scope by stakeholders.
* **Inputs:**
    * Project Scope Statement
    * WBS
    * WBS Dictionary
* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Inspections:  Formal reviews of the project scope statement and WBS.
    * Walkthroughs:  Informal reviews to identify potential issues.
    * Stakeholder reviews and sign-offs.
* **Outputs:**
    * Approved Project Scope Statement:  The scope statement signed off by key stakeholders.
    * Updated Project Management Plan:  Reflecting any changes resulting from scope validation.


**6. Control Scope:**

* **Objective:**  Manage and control changes to the project scope throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Inputs:**
    * Approved Project Scope Statement
    * Project Management Plan
    * Change Requests:  Formal requests for changes to the project scope.
* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Change Control Process:  A formal process for evaluating, approving, and implementing changes to the project scope.
    * Scope Baseline:  A formal version of the approved scope statement and WBS.
* **Outputs:**
    * Change Request Status:  Status of each change request.
    * Updated Project Scope Statement:  Reflecting approved changes.
    * Updated WBS:  Reflecting approved changes.
    * Updated Project Management Plan:  Reflecting approved changes.


This detailed process ensures that the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project is clearly defined, understood, and managed effectively throughout its lifecycle, aligning with PMBOK 7th Edition best practices. The iterative nature of the process allows for continuous refinement and adaptation as the project progresses.  The existing project documentation provides a solid foundation for this process, minimizing redundant effort.
