**Description:** PMBOK Define Scope Process

---

Below is a comprehensive **Define Scope Process** tailored to the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project, aligned with PMBOK 7th Edition standards. This process ensures the project scope is thoroughly defined, validated, and documented while accounting for the key features and requirements of the project.

# Define Scope Process  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

### 1. Purpose  
The purpose of the **Define Scope Process** is to develop a detailed description of the project scope by outlining deliverables, boundaries, constraints, assumptions, and acceptance criteria. This process ensures that the project team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the scope and provides a baseline for managing changes throughout the project lifecycle.

---

### 2. Inputs  
The following inputs are utilized during the Define Scope process:

#### 2.1 PMBOK-Aligned Inputs  
- **Project Charter**: High-level objectives, constraints, and success criteria.  
- **Stakeholder Register**: Identification of stakeholders and their needs.  
- **Requirements Documentation**: Functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Organizational Process Assets**: Templates, policies, historical records, and lessons learned.  
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors**: Industry standards, regulatory requirements, and market conditions.

#### 2.2 Project-Specific Inputs  
- **README.md Analysis**: Core features and capabilities of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  
- **Architecture Documentation**: Technical stack and design approach.  
- **Requirements Management Plan**: Strategy for requirements elicitation and traceability.  
- **Scope Management Plan**: Framework for defining, validating, and controlling scope.  

---

### 3. Activities  
The **Define Scope Process** involves the following steps:

#### 3.1 Requirements Elicitation  
- Conduct workshops with stakeholders (e.g., Project Managers, Business Analysts, Developers).  
- Analyze existing documentation: README.md, architecture docs, requirements plans, and planning artifacts.  
- Identify functional requirements (e.g., PMBOK-compliant document generation, CLI capabilities).  
- Identify non-functional requirements (e.g., performance optimization, security compliance).  
- Discover constraints (e.g., Azure OpenAI integration, TypeScript architecture).  

#### 3.2 Scope Definition  
- **In-Scope Items**:  
  - Automated generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation (e.g., charters, stakeholder registers, risk plans).  
  - Integration with AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI).  
  - CLI interface for document generation and validation.  
  - Enhanced context management for accurate document generation.  
- **Out-of-Scope Items**:  
  - Development of custom AI models.  
  - Integration with non-PMBOK frameworks.  

#### 3.3 Acceptance Criteria  
- Define measurable acceptance criteria for deliverables, such as:  
  - Generated documents must meet PMBOK 7th Edition compliance standards.  
  - CLI must support at least three AI providers with fallback mechanisms.  
  - Documentation output must pass schema validation and quality assessment scoring (>85%).  

#### 3.4 Assumptions and Constraints  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Stakeholders will provide timely feedback on deliverables.  
  - AI providers (e.g., Azure OpenAI) will maintain stable API availability.  
  - Documentation templates will align with PMBOK standards.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Limited to existing AI provider capabilities (e.g., token limits for context).  
  - Node.js/TypeScript architecture must remain modular for future extensions.  

#### 3.5 Scope Validation  
- Conduct formal scope review sessions with key stakeholders.  
- Validate defined scope against project objectives and stakeholder expectations.  
- Implement change control procedures to manage scope adjustments.

### 4. Outputs  

#### 4.1 Project Scope Statement  
A detailed document covering:  
- **Project Objectives**: Automate PMBOK-compliant document generation, improve documentation accuracy, and reduce stakeholder effort.  
- **Deliverables**: Generated PMBOK documents (e.g., scope management plans, stakeholder registers, WBS).  
- **Boundaries**: Clear delineation of in-scope and out-of-scope items.  
- **Constraints**: Integration with Azure OpenAI and Node.js architecture limitations.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Defined metrics for deliverable quality and compliance.  

#### 4.2 Supporting Documentation  
- **Requirements Management Plan**: Updated with detailed requirements identified during the Define Scope process.  
- **Scope Management Plan**: Updated with scope validation and control procedures.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Initial hierarchical structure of project tasks.  

#### 4.3 Contextual Analysis Report  
Generated by the **Enhanced Context Manager**:  
- Lists high-value documentation sources (e.g., architecture docs, stakeholder requirements).  
- Provides relevance scores (0-100) for identified files to prioritize their inclusion in scope definition.

### 5. Tools and Techniques  

#### 5.1 Expert Judgment  
Leverage the expertise of project managers, business analysts, and technical leads to validate scope.  

#### 5.2 Document Analysis  
Analyze project documentation such as README.md, architecture docs, and planning artifacts.  

#### 5.3 Workshops  
Host stakeholder engagement sessions to elicit requirements and validate scope boundaries.  

#### 5.4 Context Scoring (Project-Specific)  
Utilize the **Enhanced Context Manager** to prioritize relevant documentation based on scoring against PMBOK standards.  

---

### 6. Roles and Responsibilities  

#### Project Manager  
- Facilitate scope workshops and validation sessions.  
- Ensure alignment between project scope and objectives.  

#### Business Analyst  
- Define and document detailed functional and non-functional requirements.  
- Collaborate with technical teams to identify constraints and assumptions.  

#### Technical Lead  
- Ensure technical feasibility of scope items.  
- Validate AI provider integration requirements and constraints.  

---

### 7. Validation and Approval  
Scope validation is performed through formal review sessions with the following stakeholders:  
- **Project Sponsor**: Approves final project scope statement.  
- **Key Stakeholders**: Provide feedback and validate scope alignment with expectations.  
- **Technical Team**: Confirms technical feasibility of deliverables and constraints.  

---

### 8. Success Metrics  
The success of the Define Scope Process is measured by:  
1. **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Scope aligns with stakeholder expectations.  
2. **PMBOK Compliance**: Scope adheres to PMBOK standards in all deliverables.  
3. **Documentation Quality**: Generated documents score >85% in quality assessment.  
4. **Traceability**: Requirements and scope are traceable to project objectives.
