---

## 7. Communication Escalation Process

- **Critical issues** (e.g., security breaches, project blockers) are immediately reported to the Project Manager via email and escalated to the Sponsor and IT/Infosec.
- **Major integration or compliance risks** are documented in GitHub Issues and flagged in status reports.
- **Contributor disputes or blocking code reviews** are escalated to the Maintainers via GitHub Discussions and, if unresolved, to the Project Sponsor.

---

## 8. Communication Standards & Best Practices

- **Clarity**: Use concise, unambiguous language, and standardized templates (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK-aligned where applicable).
- **Confidentiality**: Sensitive information (credentials, PII) is shared only via secure channels (encrypted email, enterprise document management).
- **Versioning**: All project artifacts, APIs, and documentation are version-controlled (GitHub, SharePoint).
- **Traceability**: All communications related to requirements, decisions, and changes are logged and accessible (audit trail via SharePoint/Confluence).
- **Accessibility**: Core documentation and updates are published in accessible formats (Markdown, PDF, Confluence pages).
- **Open Source Etiquette**: Community contributions follow the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md), with code reviews and transparent decision logs.

## 9. Communication Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                                    | Mitigation Strategy                              |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Information silos between teams          | Cross-functional meetings, shared dashboards     |
| Missed compliance deadlines              | Automated reminders, compliance checklists       |
| API or documentation version drift       | Strict versioning, changelog enforcement         |
| Security leaks in communication          | Secure channels only, access control policies    |
| Loss of critical knowledge (turnover)    | Knowledge base in Confluence/SharePoint          |
| Contributor confusion (open source)      | Clear onboarding docs, FAQs, responsive support  |

## 10. Communication Plan Review & Continuous Improvement

- The Communication Management Plan is reviewed **quarterly** and upon major project phase transitions or after any communication-related incident.
- Feedback is solicited from all stakeholder groups via surveys and retrospectives.
- Improvement actions are tracked as project tasks or issues.
