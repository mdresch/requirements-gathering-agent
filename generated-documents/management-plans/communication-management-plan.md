# Communication Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the communication plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  Effective communication is crucial for the success of this project, given its complexity and the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including the development team, product owner, architecture team, testing team, and potentially external clients in the future. This plan details the communication methods, frequency, responsible parties, and escalation procedures to ensure timely and accurate information flow.

**2. Project Goals**

The primary communication goal is to keep all stakeholders informed of project progress, risks, issues, and decisions throughout the project lifecycle.  Secondary goals include:

* Maintaining transparency and fostering collaboration.
* Managing expectations and resolving conflicts proactively.
* Ensuring consistent messaging across all communication channels.
* Complying with relevant legal and regulatory requirements regarding data sharing and communication.  (This is particularly relevant given the project's aim for an international footprint.)
