# Communication Management Plan: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the communication management plan for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on ensuring efficient and effective communication throughout the project lifecycle.  The project aims to automate and improve the monthly backup process, ensuring reliable data recovery in case of system failure.  Effective communication is crucial for successful implementation and stakeholder buy-in.

**2. Project Goals & Objectives**

* Automate the monthly backup process.
* Implement robust validation and integrity checks for backups.
* Securely store backups using a resilient and encrypted architecture.
* Establish a clear and efficient communication strategy to keep stakeholders informed.

**3. Stakeholders**

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project execution and communication.
* **Development Team:**  Responsible for implementing the backup automation and security features.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for system infrastructure and backup infrastructure maintenance.
