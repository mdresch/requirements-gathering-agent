The RGA project involves diverse stakeholders with varying communication needs:

* **Development Team:** Requires technical details, updates on code progress, bug reports, and deployment schedules.

* **Marketing & Sales:** Requires information on product features, launch dates, marketing materials, and customer feedback.
* **Customers/Users:**  Need announcements, updates, tutorials, support documentation, and response to feedback.
* **Executive Sponsors:**  Require high-level summaries, key milestones, and overall project performance against objectives.

**3. Information to be Communicated**

The following information will be communicated regularly:
