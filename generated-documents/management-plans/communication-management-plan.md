* **Project Management Office (PMO):** Needs high-level project status updates, risk assessments, budget information, and schedule adherence.  Prefers regular reports and formal meetings.
* **Business Analysts:** Requires detailed requirements specifications, user stories, and feedback on generated documentation.  Prefers both synchronous (meetings) and asynchronous (email, project management software) communication.
* **End-Users (Project Managers & Business Analysts):** Need clear instructions, tutorials, and support documentation.  Prefers user-friendly documentation, online forums, and FAQs.
* **Marketing & Sales:** Requires updates on project milestones and marketing materials. Prefers concise reports and presentations highlighting key features and benefits.
