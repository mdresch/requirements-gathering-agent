# Control Scope Process for the Requirements Gathering Agent Project  

## Introduction  

Controlling the scope of a project is essential to ensure that all work required to complete the project successfully is included while preventing scope creep. This **Control Scope Process** adheres to the PMBOK 7th Edition standards and is tailored to the Requirements Gathering Agent project context. It defines how project scope changes are identified, assessed, approved, and implemented, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations, project objectives, and PMBOK compliance.  

---

## Purpose  

The purpose of the **Control Scope Process** is to:  
1. Monitor the status of the project scope.  
2. Ensure that changes to the scope are properly managed and integrated.  
3. Prevent unauthorized scope expansion (scope creep).  
4. Ensure deliverables meet stakeholder needs and comply with PMBOK standards.  

---

## Inputs  

The following inputs will be leveraged within the Control Scope Process:  

### 1. Project Documents  
- **Project Scope Statement**: Defines the project boundaries and deliverables.  
- **Requirements Documentation**: Outlines functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Scope Management Plan**: Guides how scope will be managed and controlled.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Provides structured, hierarchical decomposition of project deliverables.  
- **Change Log**: Tracks requested and approved changes.  
- **Stakeholder Register**: Lists stakeholders and their requirements or influence on scope decisions.  

### 2. Organizational Process Assets  
- Templates for change requests and scope control.  
- Historical project data for lessons learned.  
- Configuration management tools and processes.  

### 3. Enterprise Environmental Factors  
- Regulatory requirements for project documentation.  
- Technical limitations of AI providers and integration constraints.  

---

## Tools and Techniques  

### 1. **Variance Analysis**  
- Compare actual scope performance against the baseline scope (WBS).  
- Identify deviations from planned scope and assess their impact.  

### 2. **Change Control Process**  
- Utilize the **Change Control Board (CCB)** for evaluating, approving, or rejecting scope changes.  
- Implement a structured change request workflow: submission → review → approval → implementation → documentation.  

### 3. **Inspection and Validation**  
- Conduct formal inspections to ensure deliverables comply with the documented scope and acceptance criteria.  

### 4. **Scope Monitoring Tools**  
- **Azure OpenAI Enhanced Context Manager**: Automatically validates scope coverage across generated PMBOK-compliant documents.  
- **Relevance Scoring System**: Highlights discrepancies between planned and actual documentation relevance and completeness.  

### 5. **Stakeholder Engagement**  
- Regular stakeholder meetings to validate scope changes and confirm alignment with stakeholder requirements.

## Process Steps  

### Step 1: **Monitor Scope Performance**  
- Use the scope baseline (Scope Management Plan, WBS) to monitor progress.  
- Identify discrepancies between planned deliverables and actual outcomes using variance analysis.  

### Step 2: **Identify Scope Changes**  
- Detect scope changes through:  
  - Stakeholder feedback.  
  - Project team observations.  
  - AI provider limitations or enhancements (e.g., new features in Gemini models).  

### Step 3: **Submit Change Requests**  
- Document scope changes using a formal **Change Request Form**.  
- Include:  
  - Description of the change.  
  - Justification for the change.  
  - Impact analysis (cost, schedule, quality, risks).  

### Step 4: **Evaluate Change Requests**  
- The **Change Control Board (CCB)** reviews change requests based on:  
  - Alignment with project objectives.  
  - Feasibility of implementation.  
  - Impact on PMBOK compliance.  

### Step 5: **Approve or Reject Changes**  
- Approved changes are integrated into the project plan.  
- Rejected changes are documented with reasons for rejection.  

### Step 6: **Implement Approved Changes**  
- Update project scope documents (Scope Management Plan, WBS, Requirements Documentation).  
- Communicate changes to stakeholders and project team.  

### Step 7: **Validate Scope**  
- Inspect deliverables to ensure they meet updated scope requirements.  
- Engage stakeholders for formal acceptance of scope-related changes.  

### Step 8: **Update Records**  
- Update the **Change Log** with details of approved/rejected changes.  
- Revise project documentation (WBS, Scope Management Plan, Requirements Documentation) to reflect scope adjustments.  

---

## Outputs  

### 1. Updated Project Documents  
- Revised Scope Management Plan.  
- Updated WBS and WBS Dictionary.  
- Updated Requirements Documentation.  

### 2. Change Log  
- Records of all scope change requests, approvals, and implementations.  

### 3. Approved Deliverables  
- Final deliverables aligned with updated scope requirements.  

### 4. Lessons Learned Repository  
- Document lessons learned related to scope control for future projects.  

---

## Roles and Responsibilities  

### Project Manager  
- Ensures scope control process is implemented and adhered to.  
- Monitors scope performance and reports deviations.  
- Coordinates scope change requests and facilitates CCB meetings.  

### Change Control Board (CCB)  
- Evaluates scope change requests.  
- Approves or rejects changes based on project objectives and constraints.  

### Stakeholders  
- Provide feedback on deliverables and scope changes.  
- Validate approved changes and accept final deliverables.  

### Project Team  
- Implements approved scope changes.  
- Assists in scope validation and inspections.  

---

## Performance Metrics  

### 1. Scope Variance  
- Measure variance between planned and actual deliverables.  

### 2. Change Request Approval Rate  
- Percentage of submitted change requests that are approved.  

### 3. Stakeholder Satisfaction  
- Feedback from stakeholders on scope alignment and deliverables quality.  

### 4. PMBOK Compliance Score  
- Score from the Enhanced Context Manager validating PMBOK compliance for project documentation.

## Best Practices  

1. **Prevent Scope Creep**  
- Clearly define in-scope and out-of-scope items in the Scope Statement.  
- Use formal change control processes for all scope adjustments.  

2. **Engage Stakeholders Regularly**  
- Conduct frequent stakeholder reviews to validate scope deliverables and changes.  

3. **Leverage Automation Tools**  
- Use the Requirements Gathering Agent’s Enhanced Context Manager to validate scope coverage automatically.  

4. **Maintain Traceability**  
- Ensure all scope changes are traceable to stakeholder requirements and project objectives.  

5. **Continuous Improvement**  
- Document lessons learned and refine scope control processes for future projects.
