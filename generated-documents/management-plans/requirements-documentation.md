# Requirements Documentation: Project Backup Vermigerous

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Expert Consultant


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for Project Backup Vermigerous, a system designed to automate monthly backups, validate backup integrity, and ensure sufficient data for recovery after system failures.  The system will categorize backups by year and month.  This document focuses on improving the existing backup process with an emphasis on automation and secure recovery.


## 2. Goals

* Automate the monthly backup process.
* Ensure data integrity through validation.
* Provide a secure and reliable backup storage solution.
* Enable efficient recovery in case of system failure.
* Implement robust monitoring and alerting.


## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

* **Automated Backup Scheduling:** The system shall automatically perform backups on a monthly schedule.  The specific schedule (day of the month, time) shall be configurable.  Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines should be considered. (Priority: High)
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:** The system shall utilize incremental or differential backup strategies to minimize storage space and backup time.  The backup strategy (full, incremental, differential) should be configurable. (Priority: High)
* **Backup Validation:** The system shall generate checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for each backup and perform post-backup validation to ensure data integrity.  Any discrepancies should be logged and reported. (Priority: High)
* **Secure Storage:** Backups shall be stored in a secure, immutable storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with Write Once Read Many (WORM) capabilities).  Data shall be encrypted both at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS. Multi-region replication for disaster recovery should be implemented. (Priority: High)
* **Metadata Management:** Each backup shall be tagged with metadata including project name, year, month, and backup version.  This metadata shall be stored in a centralized, easily searchable index (e.g., JSON file, database). (Priority: High)
* **Automated Recovery Testing:** The system shall periodically (e.g., weekly) perform automated restore tests in a sandbox environment to verify the recoverability of backups.  Results of these tests, including any errors, shall be logged and reported. (Priority: Medium)
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** The system shall integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor) to track backup status, storage usage, and recovery test results.  Alerts shall be generated for backup failures, delays, and storage thresholds. (Priority: High)
* **User Interface (Optional):** A user interface (UI) may be considered for manual backup initiation, monitoring, and reporting.  (Priority: Low)


### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Backups should complete within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined based on data volume).  Restore times should also be minimized.
* **Security:** The system must adhere to all relevant security policies and regulations.  Access to backups should be strictly controlled.
* **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to accommodate future growth in data volume.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be designed for easy maintenance and updates.  Code should be well-documented and modular.
* **Reliability:** The system should be highly reliable and minimize downtime.
* **Availability:** Backups should be readily available for restoration.


### 3.3 Constraints

* **Budget:** The project has a defined budget that must be adhered to.
* **Timeline:** The project has a fixed deadline.
* **Existing Infrastructure:** The system must integrate with existing infrastructure where possible.


## 4. Acceptance Criteria

The system will be considered complete and accepted when:

* All functional requirements are met.
* All non-functional requirements are met to a satisfactory level.
* The system successfully completes automated backups and validations without errors for a period of one month.
* Automated recovery tests successfully restore data from backups.
* Monitoring and alerting mechanisms are functioning correctly.


## 5. Future Considerations

* Integration with other backup and recovery tools.
* Implementation of advanced data deduplication techniques.
* Support for different backup targets (e.g., cloud storage providers other than Azure).


This document serves as a living document and may be updated as the project progresses.  Any changes will be documented and communicated to all stakeholders.
