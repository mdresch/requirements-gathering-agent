# Requirements Documentation: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the development of a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV), a revolutionary vehicle designed to significantly reduce reliance on traditional charging infrastructure by harvesting ambient energy.  This document details functional and non-functional requirements,  technology specifications, and key project milestones.

**2. Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of this project is to develop a commercially viable electric vehicle that mitigates range anxiety and reduces dependence on the electrical grid by incorporating multiple, integrated energy harvesting systems.  Specific objectives include:

* Achieve a demonstrable increase in vehicle range through ambient energy harvesting.
* Develop a robust and reliable energy management system.
* Design a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing vehicle integration of energy harvesting components.
* Meet all relevant safety and regulatory standards for automotive vehicles.
* Develop a cost-effective manufacturing process.

**3. Functional Requirements**

The SCEV shall:

* **Harvest Solar Energy:** The vehicle's exterior shall be comprised of high-efficiency photovoltaic panels capable of converting sunlight into usable electrical energy, even under low-light conditions.  The system should dynamically adjust to varying sunlight conditions.
* **Harvest Kinetic Energy:** The vehicle's suspension system shall incorporate linear electromagnetic generators to convert kinetic energy from road irregularities and vehicle movement into electricity.  The system should be designed to withstand the stresses of normal driving conditions.
* **Harvest Thermal Energy:** Thermoelectric generators (TEGs) shall be integrated into the vehicle's powertrain and battery system to convert waste heat into electricity.  The system should be optimized for efficiency and durability.
* **Manage Energy Flow:** An AI-powered Energy Management Unit (EMU) shall intelligently manage the flow of harvested energy, prioritizing immediate use or battery storage based on real-time conditions and predictions.  The EMU should accurately predict energy generation based on weather forecasts, GPS data, and driving style.
* **Provide User Feedback:** A user-friendly dashboard shall provide real-time feedback to the driver on the amount of energy being generated from each source (solar, kinetic, thermal) and the vehicle's overall energy status.
* **Integrate with Existing EV Systems:** The energy harvesting systems shall seamlessly integrate with the vehicle's existing electrical systems, including the battery management system (BMS) and power electronics.  Integration must not compromise the safety or reliability of the existing systems.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The energy harvesting system must provide a measurable increase in vehicle range under various driving conditions.  Specific performance targets will be defined in subsequent documentation.
* **Reliability:** The system must be highly reliable and durable, capable of withstanding the rigors of daily use and extreme weather conditions.  A target Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) will be established.
* **Safety:** The system must meet all relevant safety standards and regulations for automotive applications.  This includes rigorous testing and certification.
* **Cost:** The cost of manufacturing and integrating the energy harvesting system must be within a predetermined budget to ensure commercial viability.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be designed for ease of maintenance and repair, minimizing downtime and repair costs.
* **Aesthetics:** The integration of energy harvesting components should be aesthetically pleasing and not detract from the overall design of the vehicle.
