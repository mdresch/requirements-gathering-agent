# Requirements Documentation: Requirements Gathering Agent (v2.2.0)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, version 2.2.0.  RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  The system prioritizes ease of use, extensibility, and integration with multiple AI providers.  A key consideration is the ability to adapt to future changes in the project management landscape and evolving AI capabilities.  Compliance with relevant legislation for international use is also a critical requirement.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective:**

RGA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that interacts with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) to generate project documentation.  It utilizes templates to ensure PMBOK compliance and consistent output.  The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing for the addition of new AI providers and document types in the future.  The target users are project managers and business analysts seeking to streamline their documentation processes.

**2.2 Product Functions:**

* **AI Provider Interaction:** Securely connects to and retrieves data from multiple AI providers.
* **Template Management:**  Loads, manages, and utilizes predefined templates for various PMBOK documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure, etc.).  Allows for custom template creation and modification.
* **Document Generation:** Generates PMBOK-compliant documents in JSON format based on user input and selected templates.  Includes schema validation to ensure data integrity.
* **CLI Interface:**  Provides a user-friendly CLI for interacting with the system, including configuration management, document generation, and status updates.
* **Output Management:**  Handles the output of generated documents, including file naming conventions and potential integration with external document repositories (SharePoint, Confluence - future consideration).
* **Error Handling:**  Provides informative error messages and logs for debugging and troubleshooting.
* **Documentation Generation:**  Generates user documentation including tutorials and guides.


**2.3 User Characteristics:**

The primary users are project managers and business analysts with varying levels of technical expertise. The system should be intuitive enough for less technically proficient users while offering advanced features for experienced users.

**2.4 Operating Environment:**

RGA is a Node.js application designed to run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  It requires Node.js v16 or higher and specific npm packages (listed in project metadata).
