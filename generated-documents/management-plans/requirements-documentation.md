# Requirements Documentation: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-assisted)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA RGA), a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis.  The ADPA RGA leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, stakeholder maps, and regulatory compliance documentation, significantly reducing the time and effort required for traditional business analysis processes.  This document details both functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of the ADPA RGA are:

* **Automate Requirements Elicitation:**  Generate comprehensive requirements documentation automatically based on input data.
* **Enhance Stakeholder Analysis:**  Provide AI-powered analysis of complex organizational structures and stakeholder relationships.
* **Ensure Regulatory Compliance:**  Automatically incorporate relevant regulatory frameworks (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* **Improve Efficiency:**  Reduce the time and cost associated with traditional requirements gathering processes.
* **Deliver High-Quality Output:**  Produce Fortune 500-grade deliverables that meet the highest standards of accuracy and completeness.

## 3. Target Users

The ADPA RGA is designed for use by:

* **Business Analysts:** To streamline the requirements gathering and documentation process.
* **Project Managers:** To quickly generate project charters and other essential project management documents.
* **IT Professionals:** To integrate the ADPA RGA into existing systems and workflows.
* **Compliance Officers:** To ensure regulatory compliance in project documentation.
