# Requirements Documentation: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Requirements Documentation Generator


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, leveraging AI capabilities and adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  ADPA differentiates itself through its comprehensive project analysis, enhanced context management, and robust validation features. This document covers functional and non-functional requirements,  user stories, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective:**

ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Node.js and TypeScript. It integrates with multiple AI providers (currently Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) to generate various project management documents. The tool analyzes a project's existing documentation (beyond just the README) to build a comprehensive context for generating accurate and relevant outputs.

**2.2 Product Functions:**

ADPA performs the following key functions:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Automatically discovers and analyzes all relevant project documentation (README, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, etc.), scoring their relevance to PMBOK standards.
* **Enhanced Context Management:** Employs a three-phase strategy to optimize context provision to the chosen AI model, maximizing context utilization and improving output quality.
* **PMBOK Document Generation:** Generates a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant documents, including the Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Stakeholder Register, and many others.
* **Technical Design Document Generation:** Generates a suite of technical design documents, including Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, and more.
* **Strategic Document Generation:** Creates executive-ready strategic documents like Purpose Statements and Company Values statements.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing detailed quality scores and recommendations.
* **Version Control:** Maintains a local Git repository for all generated documents, automatically versioning changes.
* **Multi-Provider Support:**  Allows users to select from multiple AI providers.
* **CLI Interface:** Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for easy interaction and batch processing.

**2.3 User Characteristics:**

The primary users of ADPA are project managers, business analysts, and technical leads who need to create and maintain comprehensive project documentation.  Secondary users include developers and other stakeholders involved in project planning and execution.  Users are assumed to have basic familiarity with the command line and project management concepts.

**2.4 Operating Environment:**

ADPA requires Node.js 18.0.0 or higher and an active account with at least one supported AI provider.  It operates on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:**

* **API Limits:**  The tool must handle rate limits and token limits imposed by the various AI providers.
* **Data Security:**  User credentials for AI providers must be handled securely (e.g., using environment variables).
* **Maintainability:** The codebase must be well-structured, modular, and easily maintainable.

## 4. Future Considerations

* **Integration with other project management tools:** Explore integration with popular PM tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Advanced analytics and reporting:** Provide more detailed insights into project context and document quality.
* **Support for additional document types:** Expand the range of documents generated to include other PMBOK artifacts or custom document templates.
* **Improved context management:** Investigate techniques for even more efficient and effective context utilization for large language models.
