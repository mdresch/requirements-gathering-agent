# Requirements Documentation: Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document ID:** RD-RGA-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-assisted Business Analyst)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" (RGA) software project.  RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from project context, primarily derived from a project's README and associated files.  This document details functional and non-functional requirements, stakeholder needs, business objectives, assumptions, constraints, prioritization, and traceability.

## 2. Functional Requirements

The RGA shall:

* **FR-1 (High):**  Parse and analyze project context from a provided README file and associated project documentation (e.g., markdown files, configuration files within specified directories).
* **FR-2 (High):**  Identify and extract relevant information from the project context to populate PMBOK-compliant documentation templates. This includes identification of key stakeholders, project goals, scope, risks, resources, and dependencies.
* **FR-3 (High):** Generate a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant documents. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Project Charter
    * Scope Statement
    * Scope Management Plan
    * Requirements Management Plan
    * Risk Management Plan
    * Communication Management Plan
    * Stakeholder Register
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
    * WBS Dictionary
    * Schedule Management Plan
    * Cost Management Plan
    * Resource Management Plan
    * Quality Management Plan
    * Procurement Management Plan
    * Project KickOff Preparations Checklist (Added per recent project update)
* **FR-4 (High):** Integrate with at least three different AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) allowing users to select their preferred provider through a configurable setting or interactive menu.
* **FR-5 (High):** Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for easy execution and configuration management, including options for specifying output directory, output format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, YAML), and level of detail.
* **FR-6 (High):**  Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to manage exceptions during parsing, AI interaction, and document generation.
* **FR-7 (Medium):**  Provide a mechanism for validating generated documents against PMBOK 7th Edition standards, highlighting areas for improvement or potential inconsistencies.  This includes a scoring mechanism for document quality.
* **FR-8 (Medium):**  Offer a mechanism for users to review and adjust the extracted project context before document generation.
* **FR-9 (Medium):** Support large context models (e.g., those with 2M token limits) by using an intelligent 3-phase context strategy.
* **FR-10 (Low):**  Provide comprehensive documentation (user guides, tutorials, API documentation).
* **FR-11 (Low):** Implement unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-1 (High):**  The RGA shall be performant, generating documents within a reasonable timeframe (defined as under 5 minutes for typical projects).
* **NFR-2 (High):** The RGA shall be secure, protecting sensitive project information and adhering to best practices for API key management and data handling.
* **NFR-3 (Medium):** The RGA shall be user-friendly, with clear instructions and intuitive CLI options.
* **NFR-4 (Medium):** The RGA shall be scalable, capable of handling projects of varying sizes and complexities.
* **NFR-5 (Low):** The RGA shall be reliable, with minimal downtime and robust error handling.
* **NFR-6 (Low):** The generated documentation shall be consistent in style and formatting.


## 4. Stakeholder Requirements

* **Project Managers:**  Need automated generation of PMBOK-compliant documents to save time and ensure consistency.
* **Business Analysts:** Require a tool that accurately reflects project requirements and facilitates stakeholder communication.
* **Developers:** Need integration with various AI providers and a robust, maintainable codebase.
* **Compliance Officers:**  Demand PMBOK compliance and validation features to mitigate risks.


## 5. Business Requirements

* **BR-1:** Reduce the time spent on project documentation by at least 50%.
* **BR-2:** Improve the accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* **BR-3:** Enhance stakeholder alignment and communication.
* **BR-4:** Mitigate compliance risks associated with incomplete or inconsistent documentation.
* **BR-5:** Increase project success rates by improving planning and execution.


## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

* **ASSUMPTION-1:**  The project context provided will be sufficient to generate meaningful PMBOK documents.
* **ASSUMPTION-2:**  The chosen AI providers will be reliable and available.
* **CONSTRAINT-1:** The RGA must be developed using Node.js and TypeScript.
* **CONSTRAINT-2:** The RGA must adhere to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.


## 7. Requirements Prioritization

Prioritization is based on MoSCoW method:

* **Must have (M):** FR-1, FR-2, FR-3, FR-4, FR-5, FR-6, NFR-1, NFR-2
* **Should have (S):** FR-7, FR-8, NFR-3, NFR-4
* **Could have (C):** FR-10, FR-11, NFR-5, NFR-6
* **Won't have (W):** None (at this time)


## 8. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

*(A full RTM would be included here, linking each requirement to specific design elements, test cases, and implementation details.  This is omitted for brevity in this example.)*


## 9. Approval and Sign-off

*(Space for signatures and dates of approval from relevant stakeholders would be included here.)*


This document serves as a living document and will be updated as the project progresses and requirements evolve.
