# Requirements Documentation: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI Language Model)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent. ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Its unique capabilities include Evaluative Contextual Synthesis and Hierarchical Authority Recognition, enabling it to reason with evidence, resolve conflicts, and respect organizational structures.


## 2. Goals

The primary goals of ADPA are:

* **Automate PMBOK Document Generation:**  Eliminate manual effort in creating project management documents.
* **Improve Accuracy and Consistency:** Reduce errors and ensure consistent documentation across projects.
* **Enhance Contextual Understanding:** Leverage AI to synthesize information from various sources and generate relevant, accurate documents.
* **Respect Organizational Structures:** Incorporate hierarchical authority and formal processes into document generation.
* **Ensure PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:** Generate documents adhering to the latest PMBOK standards.
* **Provide a User-Friendly Interface:** Offer a simple and intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for easy access and operation.
* **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Allow users to select from various AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) for optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.
* **Maintain a Self-Healing Knowledge Base:** Automatically discard outdated information and adapt to project changes.


## 3. User Requirements

ADPA's target users include project managers, business analysts, and other stakeholders involved in project documentation.  The system should:

* **Be easy to use:** The CLI should be intuitive and require minimal training.  Clear and concise documentation and error messages are crucial.
* **Provide flexibility:** Users should be able to generate individual documents or entire document suites, customize the output format (markdown, JSON, YAML), and specify output directories.
* **Generate high-quality documents:** The generated documents should be professionally written, accurate, complete, and compliant with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Handle large projects:** The system should efficiently manage and process large amounts of project data.
* **Offer comprehensive project analysis:** The system should analyze the project's existing documentation effectively, identifying and scoring relevant files for maximal context understanding.
* **Provide reporting and analytics:** The system should provide feedback on context utilization, document quality, and compliance.


## 4. Functional Requirements

The system shall:

* **Discover and analyze project documentation:**  Automatically identify and analyze relevant files (README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, etc.) within a specified directory structure.  It shall assign relevance scores (0-100) based on content, location, and naming conventions.
* **Build a comprehensive project context:** Integrate relevant information from multiple sources to create a rich context for AI processing. This context should be managed intelligently to avoid exceeding token limits while maximizing the information available to the AI model.
* **Generate PMBOK documents:** Produce a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents, including but not limited to:
    * Project Charter
    * Scope Management Plan
    * Requirements Management Plan
    * Risk Management Plan
    * Stakeholder Register
    * Communication Management Plan
    * Resource Management Plan
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
    * and others as defined in PMBOK 7.0
* **Generate technical design documents:** Produce a suite of technical design documents, including:
    * Architecture Design
    * System Design
    * Database Schema
    * API Documentation
    * Security Design
    * Performance Requirements
    * Integration Design
    * Technical Stack
    * Deployment Architecture
    * Error Handling
* **Generate strategic documents:** Produce executive-ready documents such as:
    * Purpose Statement
    * Company Values
* **Support multiple AI providers:**  Integrate with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama, allowing users to select their preferred provider.  The system should handle provider failures gracefully, potentially offering fallback mechanisms.
* **Validate generated documents:** Check for PMBOK 7.0 compliance, consistency, and completeness.  Provide detailed reports with actionable recommendations for improvement.
* **Provide a command-line interface (CLI):** Offer a user-friendly CLI for easy document generation and configuration management.
* **Implement a version control system (VCS):** Track changes to generated documents using Git, allowing users to review history, revert changes, and manage different versions.
* **Offer configurable settings:** Allow users to customize various aspects of the system through a configuration file (e.g., specifying input and output directories, AI provider settings, VCS settings).


## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** The system should generate documents efficiently, with acceptable response times even for large projects.
* **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle increasing project sizes and complexity.
* **Security:**  Secure handling of API keys and other sensitive information.  Compliance with relevant security standards.
* **Reliability:** The system should be reliable and robust, minimizing errors and downtime.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be designed for easy maintenance and updates.
* **Usability:** The system should be easy to use and understand, with clear instructions and error messages.
* **Portability:** The system should be platform-independent (cross-platform compatibility).


## 6. Constraints

* **Budget:**  Defined budget constraints for development and maintenance.
* **Timeline:**  Project deadlines and milestones.
* **Technology:**  Specific technologies and libraries to be used (Node.js, TypeScript, specified AI APIs).
* **Compliance:** Adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards and relevant security and privacy regulations.


## 7. Acceptance Criteria

The system will be considered acceptable when:

* All functional requirements are met.
* Performance benchmarks are achieved (defined in separate performance requirements document).
* Security vulnerabilities are addressed and mitigated.
* User acceptance testing (UAT) is successfully completed.
* All generated documents pass PMBOK 7.0 compliance checks.


## 8. Future Considerations

* **Integration with other project management tools:** Explore integration with popular project management platforms (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Support for additional document types:** Expand the range of generated documents to include other relevant project management artifacts.
* **Improved context management:** Further refine the context management system to handle even larger and more complex projects.
* **Enhanced AI capabilities:** Explore using more advanced AI models and techniques for improved document generation.


This document serves as a living document and will be updated as the project progresses and requirements evolve.  Further detailed specifications for individual components and modules will be provided in separate design documents.
