# Requirements Documentation: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Its key differentiators include advanced context management, hierarchical authority recognition, and a modular architecture for extensibility.

**2. Overall Description**

**2.1 Product Perspective**

ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that analyzes existing project documentation (primarily Markdown files) and generates a suite of PMBOK-compliant documents. It integrates with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and offers features such as enhanced context management, automated version control, and comprehensive validation against PMBOK standards.  It aims to replace manual documentation processes, boosting efficiency and ensuring consistency.  ADPA's output will be primarily Markdown files, organized into a structured directory.

**2.2 Product Functions**

ADPA performs the following key functions:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Analyzes project documentation (README.md and beyond) to identify and score relevant information for context building.
* **Intelligent Context Building:**  Prioritizes and integrates information from multiple sources to create a rich context for AI generation.
* **PMBOK Document Generation:** Generates a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant documents (e.g., Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Register, Stakeholder Register, etc.).
* **Technical Design Document Generation:** Generates a suite of technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, etc.).
* **Strategic Business Communication Generation:** Generates executive-ready strategic documents (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.).
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards, providing detailed reports and recommendations.
* **Document Quality Assessment:** Provides quality scores and suggestions for improvement.
* **Version Control:**  Maintains a local Git repository for generated documents, automatically versioning changes.
* **Multi-AI Provider Support:**  Supports multiple AI providers with a configurable selection mechanism.
* **Modular Architecture:** Allows for easy extension with new document types and features.

**2.3 User Characteristics**

ADPA is designed for use by project managers, business analysts, and technical writers who need to generate high-quality, PMBOK-compliant project documentation efficiently.  Users should have basic command-line skills and familiarity with project management concepts.

**2.4 Operating Environment**

ADPA is a Node.js application and requires Node.js 18.0.0 or higher.  It can run on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).  The tool requires an active API key for the chosen AI provider.

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints**

* **AI Provider Limitations:**  The accuracy and quality of generated documents are dependent on the capabilities of the chosen AI provider and the quality of the input data.
* **Context Size Limits:**  The amount of context that can be processed by the AI model is limited, potentially affecting the accuracy of generated documents for very large projects.
* **Markdown Dependency:** The primary input and output format is Markdown.
* **API Key Management:** Secure management of API keys is crucial.

**3. Specific Requirements**

**3.1 External Interface Requirements**

* **User Interface:** Command-line interface (CLI) with clear and concise commands.
* **Hardware Interfaces:**  None.
* **Software Interfaces:**  Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) via their respective APIs.
* **Communications Interfaces:**  None.

**3.2 Functional Requirements**

The detailed functional requirements are implicitly defined within the "Product Functions" section (Section 2.2) and are further elaborated in the existing README.md file.  This includes the generation of each document type, CLI commands, and validation features.

**3.3 Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** Document generation should be completed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 seconds for smaller projects, with appropriate scaling for larger projects).
* **Security:**  Secure handling of API keys and user data. Authentication mechanisms should be robust.
* **Reliability:** The tool should be reliable and robust, handling errors gracefully and providing informative error messages.
* **Usability:** The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use.  Comprehensive documentation and tutorials should be provided.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and extend.
* **Portability:** The tool should be easily deployable across different operating systems.
* **Scalability:** The system should be scalable to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities.


**3.4 Data Requirements**

ADPA requires access to project documentation (README.md and related Markdown files). The system will automatically discover and analyze these files, scoring their relevance based on content and location.

**4. Future Considerations**

* **Improved Context Management:** Explore more advanced context management techniques (e.g., semantic search, vector databases) to handle larger projects and improve accuracy.
* **Enhanced Validation:**  Expand validation capabilities beyond PMBOK compliance to include other relevant standards and guidelines.
* **GUI Development:** Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced usability.
* **Integration with Project Management Tools:** Integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) for seamless workflow integration.


**5. Appendix**

This section will include detailed specifications for each document type generated by ADPA, including examples of the expected output format and content.  This will be populated based on the existing templates and the evolving capabilities of the system.  (This appendix will be a separate document, linked here.)


This requirements document provides a high-level overview.  More detailed specifications for individual features and functions can be found within the project's source code, documentation, and associated test cases.
