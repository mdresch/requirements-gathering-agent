# Requirements Documentation: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-generated, requires human review and validation)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA RGA), a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis using AI and a BABOK v3 compliant framework.  This document details both functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria.  The ADPA RGA aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required for requirements elicitation,  delivering Fortune 500-grade deliverables with consistent accuracy and compliance.


## 2. Overall Description

**2.1 Product Perspective:**

The ADPA RGA is a server-side application (Express.js API) designed to generate comprehensive business analysis documentation based on user-provided input data.  It integrates with multiple AI providers, offering flexibility and redundancy. The system is designed for scalability and ease of use through a well-defined API and CLI.  Output is primarily JSON, ensuring interoperability with other systems.  The system is API-first, with OpenAPI 3.0 specifications provided.

**2.2 Product Functions:**

* **Requirements Elicitation:**  Automatically generate BABOK v3 compliant requirements frameworks from input data.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:**  Identify and analyze stakeholders within provided organizational structures.
* **Regulatory Compliance:**  Integrate relevant regulatory compliance frameworks (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX) into generated documents.
* **Document Generation:** Produce deliverables in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* **Template Management:** Allow users to create, manage, and utilize custom templates.
* **Job Management:**  Asynchronously process requests, providing real-time status updates.
* **API Management:** Secure API endpoints with authentication and rate limiting.
* **Multi-AI Provider Support:**  Support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) with fallback mechanisms.
* **CLI Interface:** Provide command-line tools for easy interaction and configuration.


**2.3 User Characteristics:**

The target users are business analysts, project managers, and IT professionals within large enterprises.  They may have varying levels of technical expertise but are expected to be familiar with business analysis concepts and methodologies.

**2.4 Operating Environment:**

The ADPA RGA will operate on a server environment (Node.js) and will be accessible via API calls and CLI.  It requires a stable network connection and access to the chosen AI providersâ€™ APIs. Specific hardware and software requirements will be detailed in a separate document.

**2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:**

* **Security:**  The system must meet enterprise-grade security standards, including robust authentication, authorization, and data protection.
* **Performance:**  Document generation must be efficient, completing within acceptable timeframes (sub-second for smaller projects, seconds for larger projects).
* **Scalability:** The architecture must be scalable to handle a large volume of requests and data.
* **Compliance:**  Generated documents must strictly adhere to BABOK v3 and other relevant standards.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase must be well-documented, modular, and easy to maintain.
