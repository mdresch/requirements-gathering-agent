# Requirements Documentation: Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document ID:** RD-RGA-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-assisted Business Analyst)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) software project.  The RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of comprehensive project management documentation based on PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  This documentation will serve as a blueprint for the development team, ensuring alignment between stakeholder needs and the final product.


## 2. Functional Requirements

The RGA shall:

* **2.1. Project Context Analysis:**  Analyze provided project context, including but not limited to:
    * `README.md` files
    * Project documentation within specified directories (e.g., `docs/`, `requirements/`, `specs/`)
    * Stakeholder information files (e.g., `stakeholders.md`)
    * Configuration files (e.g., `package.json`)
    * Automatically score the relevance of discovered documents (0-100 scale) based on content, location, and naming patterns.
    * Categorize discovered documents (e.g., Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other).
* **2.2. PMBOK Document Generation:** Generate a suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant documents, including (but not limited to):
    * Project Charter
    * Scope Management Plan
    * Requirements Management Plan
    * Risk Management Plan
    * Cost Management Plan
    * Quality Management Plan
    * Resource Management Plan
    * Communications Management Plan
    * Procurement Management Plan
    * Stakeholder Register
    * Stakeholder Engagement Plan
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
    * WBS Dictionary
    * Activity List and Estimates
    * Schedule Network Diagram
    * Milestone List
    * User Stories and Requirements
    * User Personas
    * Key Roles and Needs Analysis
    * Technology Stack Analysis
    * Data Model Suggestions
    * Acceptance Criteria
    * Compliance Considerations
    * UI/UX Considerations (if applicable)
* **2.3. AI Provider Integration:**  Support multiple AI providers (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) via configuration.  Allow switching between providers without requiring code recompilation.  Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for provider failures.
* **2.4. Output Management:**  Generate documents in specified formats (e.g., Markdown, JSON, YAML).  Organize output into a well-structured directory.  Support customization of the output directory.
* **2.5. Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provide a user-friendly CLI for executing the tool, specifying options (e.g., AI provider, output format, document selection), and managing configurations.
* **2.6. PMBOK Validation:**  Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  Provide detailed compliance reports with actionable recommendations for improvement.
* **2.7. Enhanced Context Management:** Employ a multi-phase context strategy that optimizes context utilization for different AI models, maximizing accuracy and minimizing token limitations.  Provide detailed context utilization reports.
* **2.8. Configuration Management:** Allow configuration of AI provider credentials and other settings via environment variables or a configuration file.



## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

* **3.1. Performance:** The RGA shall generate documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined based on testing).  The tool should efficiently handle large projects with extensive documentation.
* **3.2. Security:** The RGA shall securely handle sensitive project information and API credentials.  Compliance with relevant security standards is mandatory.
* **3.3. Scalability:** The RGA shall be scalable to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities.
* **3.4. Usability:** The RGA shall have a user-friendly CLI with clear instructions and error messages.  The generated documents shall be easily readable and understandable.
* **3.5. Maintainability:** The RGA shall be designed for ease of maintenance and future enhancements.  The codebase should be well-documented and follow best practices.
* **3.6. Reliability:** The RGA shall be reliable and robust, minimizing unexpected errors and crashes.
* **3.7. Portability:** The RGA shall be compatible with multiple operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).


## 4. Stakeholder Requirements

* **Project Managers:** Need accurate, timely, and complete project documentation to effectively manage projects.  Require PMBOK compliance and easy integration with existing tools.
* **Business Analysts:** Require a tool to efficiently gather and document requirements, ensuring clarity and traceability.
* **Developers:** Need clear and concise documentation to understand project requirements and implement the solution.
* **Compliance Officers:** Need assurance that generated documentation adheres to PMBOK standards and relevant regulations.


## 5. Business Requirements

* Reduce time spent on manual project documentation creation.
* Improve the accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* Enhance stakeholder communication and alignment.
* Mitigate project risks through proactive risk management planning.
* Improve project compliance with PMBOK standards.


## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

* The availability and performance of the chosen AI providers.
* The quality of the input project context (the more comprehensive the input, the better the output).
* The potential for changes in PMBOK standards.
* Budget and timeline constraints.


## 7. Requirements Prioritization

Requirements are prioritized based on their criticality to the project's success and feasibility.  High-priority requirements are those directly related to core functionality and PMBOK compliance.  Medium-priority requirements relate to usability and maintainability.  Low-priority requirements are those that can be addressed in future iterations.  (Detailed prioritization matrix to be included in a separate document).


## 8. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

(A separate RTM document will link requirements to design elements, test cases, and other project artifacts.)


## 9. Approval and Sign-off
