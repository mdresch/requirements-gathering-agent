# Requirements Documentation: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-assisted documentation)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This document details functional and non-functional requirements,  constraints, and acceptance criteria.

## 2. Overall Description

ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Node.js and TypeScript. It leverages large language models (LLMs) from multiple providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to analyze project context and generate various PMBOK-compliant documents.  The system is designed to be modular, extensible, and easily integrated into existing workflows.  ADPA's core functionality includes:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:** Intelligent analysis of project documentation beyond the README, including requirements documents, architecture diagrams, and stakeholder information.
* **Enhanced Context Management:** A sophisticated 3-phase context strategy to maximize context utilization for LLMs, resulting in higher-quality output.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliant Document Generation:** Automated generation of a complete suite of PMBOK documents (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, Scope Management Plan, etc.).
* **Technical Design Document Generation:**  A specialized suite of processors for generating technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, etc.).
* **Strategic Business Communication Generation:**  Translation of technical project context into strategic business documents (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.).
* **Version Control System:** Integrated version control for generated documents, enabling tracking of changes and facilitating collaboration.
* **Multiple AI Provider Support:**  Flexibility to choose from different AI providers based on cost, performance, and availability.
* **Validation and Quality Assurance:**  Built-in validation against PMBOK standards and quality assessment features providing scores and recommendations.
* **Modular Architecture:**  Allows for easy addition of new document types and features.

## 3. Specific Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

The system shall:

* **FR1: Project Context Analysis:** Analyze provided project context, including but not limited to README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, and stakeholder information.  The system shall identify and prioritize relevant information based on PMBOK terminology and context relevance scoring (0-100).
* **FR2: PMBOK Document Generation:** Generate a complete set of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents based on the analyzed project context.  This includes documents from all PMBOK process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling, Closing).
* **FR3: Technical Design Document Generation:** Generate ten specialized technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, Error Handling). Each document type shall have dedicated AI prompts optimized for that domain.
* **FR4: Strategic Document Generation:** Generate executive-ready strategic documents such as Company Values, Purpose Statements, Mission and Vision statements, based on the project context.
* **FR5: Multiple AI Provider Support:**  Support Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama as AI providers.  Allow users to select the preferred provider via CLI or configuration file.  Implement fallback mechanisms for provider failures.
* **FR6:  Version Control:** Maintain a local Git repository for all generated documents. Automatically commit changes after each generation.  Provide CLI commands for viewing history, viewing diffs, reverting to previous versions, and optionally syncing with a remote repository.
* **FR7:  Validation and Quality Assessment:** Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards. Provide detailed quality scores (0-100) and actionable recommendations for improvement.  Assess cross-document consistency.
* **FR8: CLI Interface:** Provide a comprehensive CLI interface for all functionalities, including document generation, provider selection, validation, and version control.
* **FR9:  Output Formatting:**  Generate documents in Markdown (.md), JSON (.json), and YAML (.yaml) formats.
* **FR10:  Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to manage unexpected issues and provide informative error messages to the user.
* **FR11:  Modular Architecture:**  Employ a modular, processor-based architecture to facilitate the addition of new document types and features.  Processors shall be configurable via a JSON configuration file.

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1: Performance:** The system shall generate documents within a reasonable timeframe (defined as under 5 minutes for most projects).
* **NFR2: Scalability:** The system shall be able to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities.
* **NFR3: Security:**  Securely integrate with AI providers using appropriate authentication methods (e.g., Entra ID for Azure OpenAI, API keys for others). Protect sensitive project data.
* **NFR4: Usability:** The system shall have a user-friendly CLI interface with clear instructions and error messages.
* **NFR5: Maintainability:** The system shall be well-documented and easy to maintain and extend.
* **NFR6: Reliability:** The system shall be reliable and consistently produce accurate and consistent results.


### 3.3 Constraints

* **C1:  AI Provider APIs:** The system is dependent on the availability and performance of the chosen AI provider APIs.
* **C2:  Token Limits:** The system's ability to generate comprehensive documents is limited by the token limits of the chosen AI provider's models.
* **C3:  Context Size:**  The effectiveness of the AI model is dependent on the quality and relevance of the provided project context.  Very large projects may require manual curation of the provided context.


### 3.4 Acceptance Criteria

The system shall be considered acceptable when:

* All functional requirements are met.
* All non-functional requirements are met to a satisfactory level.
* The system successfully generates accurate and complete PMBOK compliant documents.
* The system passes a comprehensive set of unit and integration tests.
* The system demonstrates robust error handling and logging.
* User acceptance testing confirms usability and satisfaction.


## 4. Future Considerations

* **Integration with Existing Project Management Tools:** Integrate with popular project management platforms (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Advanced Context Analysis:** Implement more sophisticated techniques for analyzing and prioritizing project context.
* **Customizable Templates:** Allow users to customize document templates.
* **Multi-lingual Support:** Support multiple languages for document generation.


This document serves as a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.  Any changes will be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
