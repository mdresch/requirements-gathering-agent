## 1. Introduction and Purpose  

### Purpose  
The purpose of this document is to define and capture the requirements for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This tool is designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation using Azure OpenAI and other AI providers. The document provides a structured framework for understanding the functional, non-functional, stakeholder, and business requirements to ensure the successful delivery of the project.  

### Project Objectives  
- Automate the creation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  
- Improve project documentation accuracy and consistency.  
- Enhance productivity by reducing manual effort in requirements gathering and documentation processes.  
- Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards across all generated documents.
