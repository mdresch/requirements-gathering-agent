## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this requirements documentation is to define, in detail, the functional and non-functional requirements for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework. ADPA is designed to automate the creation of standards-compliant documentation for enterprise environments, supporting business analysis, project management, and data governance. Leveraging AI and modular architecture, it serves as a foundation for professional, scalable, and secure document generation and workflow automation.

### 1.2 Scope
ADPA provides:
- Modular, extensible automation for requirements, project, and data management artifacts.
- AI-powered content generation using multiple providers.
- CLI, REST API, and admin web interfaces for flexible enterprise integration.
- Compliance with industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0).
- Enterprise-ready integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, VCS).
- Security, regulatory compliance, and scalability for Fortune 500 environments.
