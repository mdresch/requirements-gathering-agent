# Collectrequirementsprocess: Project Backup Vermigerous

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date Created:** October 26, 2023

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for improving the backup process for Project Backup Vermigerous.  The primary goals are to automate the backup process, enhance data security, and ensure reliable recovery in case of system failure.  The current system performs monthly backups categorized by year and month, but lacks automation and robust validation.

## 2. Goals

* **Automation:** Fully automate the monthly backup process, minimizing manual intervention.
* **Security:** Implement robust security measures to protect backup data at rest and in transit.
* **Reliability:** Ensure the integrity and recoverability of backup data through validation and testing.
* **Efficiency:** Optimize backup processes to minimize storage space and execution time.
* **Scalability:** Design a system capable of handling increasing data volumes over time.


## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

* **Automated Backup Scheduling:** The system shall automatically initiate backups on a monthly schedule.  The specific schedule (day of the month, time of day) shall be configurable.  Integration with a CI/CD pipeline should be considered for backups related to deployment cycles.
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:** The system shall support incremental or differential backups to reduce storage space and backup time. The backup strategy (full, incremental, differential) shall be configurable.
* **Data Validation:**  The system shall generate checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for each backup and verify their integrity after the backup completes.  Any discrepancies shall be logged and trigger alerts.
* **Secure Storage:** Backups shall be stored in immutable storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy).  Data encryption (AES-256) at rest and in transit (TLS) is mandatory. Multi-region replication for disaster recovery is required.
* **Metadata Management:** Each backup shall be tagged with metadata including project name ("Project Backup Vermigerous"), year, month, backup type (full, incremental, differential), and checksum.  This metadata shall be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON file, database) for easy retrieval and search.
* **Automated Recovery Testing:** The system shall periodically (e.g., weekly) perform automated restore tests in a non-production environment to verify data recoverability. Results of these tests, including any errors, shall be logged and reported.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** The system shall monitor backup status and trigger alerts for failures, delays, or storage threshold breaches.  Integration with a monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor, Prometheus) is required.


### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

* **Performance:** Backups shall complete within a defined time window (to be determined based on data volume).  Restore times shall also meet acceptable performance targets.
* **Security:** The system shall adhere to all relevant security policies and standards.  Access control mechanisms shall be implemented to restrict access to backup data.
* **Scalability:** The system shall be designed to scale to accommodate future growth in data volume.
* **Maintainability:** The system shall be designed for ease of maintenance and updates.  Code shall be well-documented and follow best practices.
* **Usability:**  System administration and monitoring shall be user-friendly and intuitive.


### 3.3 Constraints

* **Budget:**  The project shall adhere to the allocated budget.
* **Timeline:** The project shall be completed within the defined timeframe.
* **Existing Infrastructure:** The solution must integrate with the existing IT infrastructure.


## 4. Acceptance Criteria

The system will be considered acceptable if it meets all functional and non-functional requirements and successfully completes a series of acceptance tests, including:

* Successful completion of automated monthly backups.
* Verification of data integrity through checksum validation.
* Successful restoration of data from backups in a test environment.
* Successful triggering and handling of alerts for various failure scenarios.
* Demonstration of scalability and performance within defined limits.


## 5. Future Considerations

* Integration with other backup solutions.
* Implementation of advanced backup technologies (e.g., cloud-native backup services).
* Enhanced reporting and analytics capabilities.


This document serves as a living document and will be updated as the project progresses and new requirements emerge.
