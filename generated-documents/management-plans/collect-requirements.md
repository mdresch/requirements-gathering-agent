# Collect Requirements Process

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** October 26, 2023


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the process for collecting requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The RGA aims to revolutionize project documentation generation by leveraging AI and adhering to PMBOK standards.  This process emphasizes iterative refinement and stakeholder collaboration to ensure the final product meets the needs of all involved parties.  Given the project's scope and the need for international compliance, a rigorous and documented approach is crucial.

## 2. Stakeholders

Key stakeholders involved in the requirements gathering process include:

* **Development Team:** Responsible for the technical implementation of the RGA.
* **Product Owner:** Defines the product vision and prioritizes features.
* **Architecture Team:** Ensures the system's scalability and maintainability.
* **Testing Team:** Validates the functionality and performance of the RGA.
* **Legal/Compliance Team:** Ensures adherence to all relevant legislation and regulations.
* **Internationalization Team (if applicable):**  Addresses localization and internationalization requirements.


## 3. Requirements Elicitation Techniques

We will employ a multi-faceted approach to requirements elicitation, combining the following techniques:

* **Document Analysis:** Reviewing existing project management documentation (e.g., PMBOK guides, internal standards) to identify existing best practices and potential requirements.  Specifically, we will analyze the provided `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` and other relevant documentation.

* **Interviews:** Conducting structured interviews with key stakeholders to gather their perspectives and needs.  This will include detailed discussions about desired functionalities, performance expectations, and compliance requirements.

* **Workshops:** Facilitating workshops to collaboratively brainstorm and refine requirements. This will help to identify potential conflicts and reach consensus among stakeholders.

* **Prototyping:** Developing low-fidelity prototypes to visually represent and validate the system's functionality and user interface.  This iterative approach allows for early feedback and adjustment.

* **Surveys:** Utilizing surveys to gather feedback from a broader range of stakeholders, especially those who may not be readily available for individual interviews.


## 4. Requirements Documentation

Requirements will be documented using a combination of techniques:

* **User Stories:**  Employing user stories (e.g., "As a project manager, I want to generate a PMBOK-compliant project charter so that I can effectively initiate my project.") to capture functional requirements from a user's perspective.

* **Use Cases:**  Defining use cases to describe the interactions between the user and the system for specific functionalities.

* **Non-Functional Requirements List:**  Creating a separate list to detail non-functional requirements such as performance, security, scalability, maintainability, and compliance.  This list will explicitly address the security concerns highlighted in `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD` and ensure compliance is not overlooked.

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  Developing a traceability matrix to link requirements to design specifications, test cases, and other project artifacts.  This ensures comprehensive coverage and allows for efficient change management.


## 5. Requirements Prioritization

Requirements will be prioritized based on several factors:

* **Business Value:**  The contribution of the requirement to the overall business goals.
* **Risk:** The potential impact of not meeting the requirement.
* **Feasibility:** The ease and cost of implementing the requirement.
* **Dependencies:**  The relationship between requirements and their interdependencies.

Prioritization will be achieved using a combination of MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) and a weighted scoring system.  The results will be documented and shared with all stakeholders.


## 6. Requirements Validation and Verification

Requirements will be validated through stakeholder reviews and prototyping.  Verification will be performed through testing activities, ensuring that the implemented system meets the defined requirements.  The comprehensive API testing approach outlined in `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD` will serve as a foundation for the verification process.


## 7. Change Management

A formal change management process will be established to handle any changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  All change requests will be documented, reviewed, and approved by the relevant stakeholders before being incorporated into the system.


## 8.  Compliance Considerations

The project's international footprint and legal compliance are paramount.  The requirements gathering process will include dedicated sessions with the legal/compliance team to ensure adherence to all relevant regulations.  This will be reflected in the requirements documentation and tracked through the traceability matrix.


## 9. Tooling

The project will leverage the existing `requirements-gathering-agent` tool for generating project documentation.  The architecture outlined in `ARCHITECTURE.MD` will guide the integration of new features and functionalities.  The integration with SharePoint (`SHAREPOINT-USAGE-GUIDE.MD`) and other platforms will be carefully considered during the requirements gathering process.


## 10. Deliverables

The requirements gathering process will produce the following deliverables:

* **Requirements Specification Document:** A comprehensive document outlining all functional and non-functional requirements.
* **User Stories:** A collection of user stories describing the system's functionality from a user's perspective.
* **Use Cases:**  Detailed descriptions of user interactions with the system.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** A matrix linking requirements to design, test cases, and other artifacts.
* **Prioritized Requirements List:**  A list of requirements ranked by priority.


This process will be iteratively refined throughout the project, ensuring that the final product meets the needs of all stakeholders and complies with all relevant regulations.
