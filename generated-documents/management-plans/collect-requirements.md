## Collect Requirements Process

### 1. Process Overview

**1.1 Purpose and Objectives:** This process defines how to systematically collect, analyze, document, and validate requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project. The objective is to ensure that all necessary requirements are identified, understood, and documented accurately to support successful project execution and delivery.  This process aligns with the PMBOK Guide's Planning process group and the Requirements Management knowledge area.

**1.2 Process Scope and Boundaries:** This process covers all activities related to gathering requirements for the RGA project, from initial stakeholder identification to final requirement approval. It excludes the detailed design, development, testing, and deployment phases.

**1.3 Integration with Other Project Processes:** This process is closely integrated with the Scope Management, Risk Management, and Communication Management processes.  Outputs from this process directly feed into the scope baseline, risk register, and communication plan.  It also informs the project schedule and resource allocation.

**1.4 PMBOK Process Group and Knowledge Area Alignment:** This process falls under the Planning process group and specifically aligns with the Requirements Management knowledge area of the PMBOK Guide.


### 2. Process Inputs

* **Project Charter and Business Case:** Provides high-level project objectives, scope, constraints, and the rationale for the project.  (From Project Charter document)
* **Requirements Management Plan:** Outlines the approach, methods, and tools for requirements management throughout the project lifecycle. (From 02_Requirements_Management_Plan.MD)
* **Stakeholder Register and Analysis:** Identifies all stakeholders, their interests, and influence on the project.  (Derived from Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Analysis documents)
* **Relevant Project Documents:**  Includes the README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and other relevant documentation identified during the project analysis phase. (From Project README and identified documents)


### 3. Tools and Techniques

* **Data Gathering Techniques:**
    * **Interviews:** Structured and unstructured interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.
    * **Focus Groups:** Facilitated sessions with groups of stakeholders to explore requirements and identify common themes.
    * **Surveys:** Distributed questionnaires to gather input from a large number of stakeholders.
    * **Document Analysis:** Review of existing project documents (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) to extract requirements.
    * **Observation:** Observing users interacting with similar systems to identify needs and pain points.
* **Data Analysis Techniques:**
    * **Prioritization Matrices:** Using techniques like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize requirements.
    * **Document Analysis:** Systematic review of collected documentation to identify and analyze requirements.
    * **Benchmarking:** Comparing requirements with similar projects or systems to identify best practices and potential improvements.
* **Decision-Making Techniques:**
    * **Voting:** Simple voting methods to reach consensus on requirements.
    * **Prioritization Workshops:** Facilitated sessions to prioritize requirements based on value, risk, and feasibility.
* **Data Representation Techniques:**
    * **User Stories:** Concise descriptions of requirements from the user's perspective.
    * **Use Cases:** Detailed descriptions of interactions between users and the system.
    * **Prototyping:** Creating mockups or prototypes to visualize requirements and gather feedback.
    * **Storyboarding:** Visual representation of user journeys and interactions.
* **Interpersonal and Team Skills:**
    * **Facilitation:** Guiding requirements elicitation sessions effectively.
    * **Negotiation:** Resolving conflicts and reaching compromises on requirements.
    * **Communication:** Clearly and concisely communicating requirements to stakeholders.


### 4. Process Outputs

* **Requirements Documentation:** A comprehensive document outlining all approved requirements, including functional, non-functional, and business requirements.  (This will be a consolidated document from various sources)
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** A matrix linking requirements to design, development, testing, and other project artifacts. (This will be generated by the system)
* **Process Updates and Refinements:** Documentation of any changes or improvements made to the requirements collection process itself. (This will be part of the overall project documentation)


### 5. Requirements Collection Activities

**5.1 Stakeholder Identification and Engagement:**  Identify all stakeholders impacted by the project (using the Stakeholder Register) and engage them through appropriate communication channels. This includes establishing communication plans and regular meetings.

**5.2 Requirements Elicitation Sessions:** Conduct workshops, interviews, and surveys to elicit requirements from stakeholders.  Document findings meticulously.

**5.3 Requirements Analysis and Validation:** Analyze collected requirements to identify conflicts, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. Validate requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.  This includes using prioritization matrices to ensure focus on the most important requirements.

**5.4 Requirements Documentation and Approval:** Document all approved requirements in a formal requirements specification document.  Obtain formal sign-off from key stakeholders.


### 6. Quality Considerations

* **Requirements Quality Criteria:**  Requirements should be clear, concise, unambiguous, feasible, testable, traceable, and consistent.
* **Validation and Verification Methods:** Use reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections to validate and verify the accuracy and completeness of requirements.
* **Review and Approval Processes:** Establish a formal process for reviewing and approving requirements, including stakeholder sign-off.
* **Continuous Improvement Approaches:** Regularly review and update the requirements collection process based on lessons learned and feedback.


### 7. Process Metrics

* **Requirements Collection Metrics:** Track the number of requirements collected, the number of changes, and the time spent on requirements gathering.
* **Quality Measurements:**  Measure the clarity, completeness, consistency, and feasibility of requirements.
* **Progress Tracking Methods:**  Use Gantt charts, burn-down charts, and other tracking methods to monitor progress.
* **Performance Indicators:**  Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the effectiveness of the requirements collection process.


### 8. Risk Management

* **Requirements-Related Risks:** Identify potential risks related to requirements gathering, such as incomplete requirements, conflicting requirements, and unrealistic timelines. (Refer to Risk Management Plan)
* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:** Develop strategies to mitigate identified risks.  This could include additional stakeholder engagement, more thorough analysis, or contingency planning.
* **Contingency Planning:** Plan for unexpected events that could impact the requirements gathering process.
* **Risk Monitoring Procedures:** Regularly monitor and assess risks to ensure that mitigation strategies are effective.


### 9. Communication Management

* **Stakeholder Communication Plan:** Define a plan for communicating requirements to stakeholders throughout the process. (Refer to Communication Management Plan)
* **Requirements Communication Methods:** Use appropriate communication methods, such as email, meetings, and presentations, to communicate requirements effectively.
* **Feedback and Collaboration Processes:** Establish processes for gathering feedback from stakeholders and collaborating on requirements.
* **Status Reporting Procedures:** Regularly report on the progress of the requirements gathering process.


### 10. Process Integration

* **Integration with Scope Management:** The collected requirements directly contribute to the scope baseline.
* **Connection to Design and Development:** Requirements serve as the foundation for design and development activities.
* **Alignment with Testing and Validation:** Requirements provide the basis for testing and validation plans.
* **Relationship to Change Management:** A formal change management process should be in place to handle changes to approved requirements.


This Collect Requirements Process document provides a framework for managing requirements for the RGA project. The specific techniques and tools used will be tailored based on the project's needs and context.  The process will be iteratively refined throughout the project lifecycle.
