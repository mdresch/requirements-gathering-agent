**Author:** AI-powered PMBOK Requirements Gathering Agent


### 1. Process Overview

**1.1 Purpose and Objectives:** This process defines how requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project will be collected, analyzed, documented, and validated.  The objective is to ensure that all stakeholder needs are understood, documented comprehensively, and traceable throughout the project lifecycle, resulting in a complete and accurate set of requirements that meet PMBOK standards.

**1.2 Process Scope and Boundaries:** This process encompasses all activities related to gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements for the RGA project, from initial stakeholder identification to final requirement approval.  It excludes the subsequent processes of requirements management, design, development, and testing.

**1.3 Integration with Other Project Processes:** This process is closely integrated with the following project processes:

* **Initiating:** The project charter and business case provide initial direction and scope for requirements collection.
* **Planning:** The requirements management plan guides the execution of this process.  Outputs from this process feed into the scope baseline and project schedule.
* **Monitoring and Controlling:**  Progress against requirements collection metrics is monitored and reported.  Changes to requirements are managed through the change management process.
* **Closing:** Approved requirements are formally baselined at the end of this process.

**1.4 PMBOK Process Group and Knowledge Area Alignment:** This process aligns with the Planning process group and the Requirements Management knowledge area within the PMBOK Guide.


### 2. Process Inputs

* **Project Charter:** Defines the high-level objectives, scope, and constraints of the RGA project.
* **Requirements Management Plan:** Outlines the approach, methods, and tools to be used for requirements collection, analysis, and management.  (This document itself is an output of a prior planning process)
* **Stakeholder Register:** Identifies all stakeholders involved in the RGA project, their roles, and their interests.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:**  Documents stakeholder needs, expectations, and influence on the project.
* **Project README and Related Documentation:**  Provides initial information about the project's functionality, features, and goals (as provided in the project context).
* **Other Relevant Project Documents:**  Including but not limited to architecture documentation, design specifications, and user stories.


### 3. Tools and Techniques

**3.1 Data Gathering Techniques:**

* **Interviews:** Structured and unstructured interviews with key stakeholders to elicit requirements.
* **Focus Groups:** Facilitated discussions with groups of stakeholders to gather diverse perspectives.
* **Surveys:** Distributed questionnaires to collect information from a large number of stakeholders.
* **Document Analysis:** Review of existing project documentation to identify implicit and explicit requirements.
* **Observations:** Observing users or stakeholders interacting with similar systems.

**3.2 Data Analysis Techniques:**

* **Document Analysis:**  Review and analysis of existing documentation (README, architecture, use cases, etc.) to extract requirements.
* **Benchmarking:** Comparing the RGA project to similar projects to identify best practices and potential requirements.
* **SWOT Analysis:** Identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the project requirements.
* **Prioritization Matrices:**  Using techniques like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize requirements.

**3.3 Decision-Making Techniques:**

* **Voting:**  Simple majority voting to resolve conflicts or prioritize requirements.
* **Prioritization:** Techniques like weighted scoring, cost-benefit analysis, and MoSCoW method.
* **Decision Trees:**  A structured approach to making complex decisions.
* **Consensus Building:**  Working collaboratively to reach agreement on requirements.

**3.4 Data Representation Techniques:**

* **Prototyping:**  Creating working models of the system to validate requirements.
* **Storyboarding:**  Visual representation of user interactions and system workflows.
* **Use Cases:**  Describing user interactions with the system.
* **User Stories:**  Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually following a template like "As a [user type], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]".

**3.5 Interpersonal and Team Skills:**

* **Facilitation:** Guiding and managing requirements elicitation sessions.
* **Negotiation:**  Resolving conflicts and reaching compromises among stakeholders.
* **Communication:**  Clearly and effectively communicating requirements to all stakeholders.
* **Active Listening:**  Paying close attention to stakeholder input and understanding their perspectives.


### 4. Process Outputs

* **Requirements Documentation:** A comprehensive document specifying all approved requirements for the RGA project, including functional, non-functional, and business requirements.  This will be in a format easily consumed by developers.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** A matrix that links requirements to design elements, test cases, and other project artifacts.
* **Process Updates and Refinements:**  Documentation reflecting any changes or improvements made to the requirements collection process itself during project execution.


### 5. Requirements Collection Activities

**5.1 Stakeholder Identification and Engagement:**  Identify and engage all stakeholders relevant to the RGA project (developers, PMs, business analysts, end-users, etc.). This includes creating a stakeholder register and performing a stakeholder analysis to understand their needs, influence, and communication preferences.

**5.2 Requirements Elicitation Sessions:** Conduct workshops, interviews, and focus groups to elicit requirements from stakeholders.  Use appropriate techniques to gather information and ensure all stakeholders have an opportunity to contribute.

**5.3 Requirements Analysis and Validation:** Analyze the collected requirements to identify inconsistencies, ambiguities, and conflicts.  Validate the requirements by reviewing them with stakeholders and ensuring they are feasible, realistic, and meet the project objectives.

**5.4 Requirements Documentation and Approval:** Document the approved requirements in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner.  Obtain formal approval from key stakeholders for the documented requirements.


### 6. Quality Considerations

**6.1 Requirements Quality Criteria:** Requirements should be:

* **Complete:**  All necessary information is provided.
* **Consistent:**  No conflicts or contradictions exist.
* **Unambiguous:**  The meaning is clear and easily understood.
* **Feasible:**  The requirements can be implemented within the project constraints.
* **Testable:**  The requirements can be verified through testing.
* **Traceable:**  The requirements can be linked to other project artifacts.

**6.2 Validation and Verification Methods:**  Use reviews, walkthroughs, inspections, and prototypes to validate and verify the requirements.

**6.3 Review and Approval Processes:**  Establish a formal process for reviewing and approving requirements, including stakeholder sign-off.

**6.4 Continuous Improvement Approaches:** Regularly review and update the requirements collection process to identify areas for improvement.


### 7. Process Metrics

* **Number of requirements collected:** Tracks the total number of requirements gathered.
* **Number of requirements approved:**  Tracks the number of requirements approved by stakeholders.
* **Requirements change rate:**  Measures the frequency of changes to requirements.
* **Requirement completion rate:**  Tracks the percentage of requirements completed within the planned timeframe.
* **Requirement defect rate:**  Tracks the number of defects found in the requirements.
* **Stakeholder satisfaction:**  Measures stakeholder satisfaction with the requirements collection process.
