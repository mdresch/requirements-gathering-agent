# Collect Requirements Process Document

## Collect Requirements Process

### Process Overview

#### Purpose and Objectives of Requirements Collection
The purpose of the Collect Requirements process is to systematically identify, document, and manage stakeholder needs and expectations to define the project's scope. This process ensures that all requirements are captured accurately and aligned with business objectives, enabling successful project execution and delivery.

The key objectives are:
- **Identify Stakeholder Needs**: Gather input from all relevant stakeholders.
- **Define Project Requirements**: Document functional and non-functional requirements to guide project design and execution.
- **Enable Traceability**: Establish a clear connection between requirements, project deliverables, and objectives to ensure alignment and accountability.

#### Process Scope and Boundaries
This process covers the identification, analysis, and documentation of all requirements related to the project. The boundaries of this process end after requirements have been validated, approved, and documented. It excludes activities related to implementation or testing of requirements.

#### Integration with Other Project Processes
This process integrates with several other PMBOK processes:
- **Scope Management**: Defines the scope based on collected requirements.
- **Stakeholder Management**: Engages stakeholders to gather and validate requirements.
- **Risk Management**: Identifies risks associated with requirements collection and validation.
- **Quality Management**: Ensures requirements meet quality standards for accuracy and completeness.

#### PMBOK Process Group and Knowledge Area Alignment
- **Process Group**: Planning
- **Knowledge Area**: Scope Management

### Process Inputs

#### Key Inputs
The Collect Requirements process relies on the following inputs:
1. **Project Charter**: Defines high-level project objectives, scope, and constraints.
2. **Business Case**: Provides the rationale behind the project and its strategic alignment.
3. **Requirements Management Plan**: Outlines the approach for collecting, analyzing, and managing requirements.
4. **Stakeholder Register**: Identifies stakeholders and their roles, interests, and influence.
5. **Other Relevant Documents**:
   - Scope Management Plan
   - Organizational Process Assets (e.g., templates, historical data)
   - Enterprise Environmental Factors (e.g., industry standards, regulations)
   - Existing project documentation (e.g., architecture documents, specifications)

### Tools and Techniques

#### Data Gathering Techniques
- **Interviews**: One-on-one or group discussions with stakeholders to uncover their needs.
- **Focus Groups**: Facilitated discussions with key stakeholders for collective input.
- **Surveys and Questionnaires**: Structured tools to gather quantitative and qualitative data.
- **Workshops**: Collaborative sessions to elicit detailed requirements.

#### Data Analysis Techniques
- **Document Analysis**: Reviewing existing documentation to identify relevant requirements.
- **Benchmarking**: Comparing requirements against similar projects or industry standards.

#### Decision-Making Techniques
- **Voting**: Stakeholder consensus-building through prioritization and selection methods.
- **Prioritization Matrix**: Ranking requirements based on impact, feasibility, and stakeholder value.

#### Data Representation Techniques
- **Prototyping**: Developing mockups or simulations to clarify requirements.
- **Storyboarding**: Visualizing user interactions and workflows to refine requirements.

#### Interpersonal and Team Skills
- **Facilitation**: Managing group discussions to ensure effective participation.
- **Negotiation**: Resolving conflicting requirements or priorities among stakeholders.

### Process Outputs

#### Key Outputs
1. **Requirements Documentation**:
   - Detailed descriptions of functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Categorized requirements (e.g., business, technical, regulatory).
   - Acceptance criteria for each requirement.
2. **Requirements Traceability Matrix**:
   - Links between requirements, deliverables, and project objectives.
   - Ensures traceability throughout project execution and testing.
3. **Process Updates and Refinements**:
   - Updates to the requirements management plan and other project documentation.

### Requirements Collection Activities

#### Stakeholder Identification and Engagement
- Identify all stakeholders and their roles in the project.
- Engage stakeholders through interviews, focus groups, or surveys to gather requirements.

#### Requirements Elicitation Sessions
- Conduct workshops and brainstorming sessions to explore detailed needs.
- Use data visualization techniques, such as storyboards and prototypes, to facilitate understanding.

#### Requirements Analysis and Validation
- Analyze collected requirements for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.
- Validate requirements with stakeholders to ensure alignment with project objectives.

#### Requirements Documentation and Approval
- Document requirements in a clear, organized format.
- Obtain formal approval from key stakeholders to finalize requirements.

### Quality Considerations

#### Requirements Quality Criteria
- **Completeness**: Requirements include all necessary details for implementation and testing.
- **Consistency**: Requirements do not conflict with each other or project objectives.
- **Feasibility**: Requirements are achievable within project constraints.
- **Traceability**: Requirements are linked to deliverables and objectives.

#### Validation and Verification Methods
- Stakeholder reviews and sign-offs.
- Alignment with PMBOK standards and industry best practices.

#### Review and Approval Processes
- Conduct quality assurance reviews of requirements documentation.
- Secure formal approval from stakeholders and the project sponsor.

#### Continuous Improvement Approaches
