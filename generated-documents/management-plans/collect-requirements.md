# Collectrequirementsprocess for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date Created:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI Requirements Documentation Specialist)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements collection process for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project. This process aims to efficiently and effectively gather, analyze, and document requirements to ensure the successful development and deployment of a high-quality, industry-leading enterprise business analysis automation platform.  The process leverages the project's existing documentation and the provided project context to ensure alignment and completeness.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is to revolutionize enterprise business analysis by automating the generation of comprehensive, compliant frameworks (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and future DMBOK 2.0 support) in seconds, not weeks. Key objectives include:

* **Automated Framework Generation:**  Rapid creation of high-quality, industry-standard compliant business analysis frameworks.
* **Multi-Provider Support:** Flexibility to integrate with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Robust security features to protect sensitive data.
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Ability to handle large-scale enterprise scenarios efficiently.
* **User-Friendly Interface:**  Intuitive user experience for both CLI and API interactions.
* **Extensibility:**  Modular design to facilitate future enhancements and integrations.

## 3. Requirements Elicitation Techniques

The following techniques will be employed to gather requirements:

* **Review of Existing Documentation:**  Thorough analysis of the provided project README, architecture documents, and other relevant documentation to extract functional and non-functional requirements.  This includes analysis of the existing `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD` document to understand the initial scope and identifying the gap between that and the current, enhanced vision.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Discussions with key stakeholders (developers, product owners, business analysts, etc.) to clarify ambiguities, gather missing requirements, and validate existing assumptions.  This will particularly focus on understanding the needs and pain points of enterprise users.
* **Prototyping and User Feedback:**  Development of prototypes and interactive demonstrations to gather user feedback on the usability and functionality of the system.  The BABOK Enterprise Demonstration Guide will be instrumental in this phase.
* **API Specification Review:**  Careful examination of the TypeSpec API specifications (`api-specs/`) to ensure alignment between the API design and the overall system requirements.
* **Test Case Analysis:**  Review of the comprehensive API testing summary (`API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`) to identify any gaps or missing requirements revealed during testing.


## 4. Requirements Documentation

Requirements will be documented using a combination of techniques:

* **User Stories:** Concise descriptions of user needs and desired system functionality.
* **Use Cases:** Detailed scenarios illustrating how users interact with the system.
* **Functional Requirements Specification (FRS):**  A formal document outlining the system's functional capabilities.  This will be built upon the existing `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` document.
* **Non-Functional Requirements Specification (NFRS):**  A formal document specifying non-functional attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and usability.
* **Data Dictionary:**  A comprehensive list of data elements and their definitions.
* **API Specification:**  The OpenAPI 3.0 specification will serve as the primary source for API-related requirements.


## 5. Requirements Analysis and Prioritization

The collected requirements will be analyzed to identify dependencies, conflicts, and redundancies.  Requirements will be prioritized based on business value, risk, and technical feasibility.  The MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) will be used for prioritization.

## 6. Requirements Validation and Verification

Requirements will be validated through stakeholder review and sign-off.  Verification will be performed throughout the development lifecycle through testing and user feedback. The existing test data (`test-data/`) and the success metrics detailed in the project README will be key in validating the system's capabilities.

## 7. Requirements Traceability

A traceability matrix will be maintained to track requirements throughout the entire development lifecycle, linking requirements to design, implementation, and testing artifacts.

## 8. Change Management

A formal change management process will be established to handle any changes to requirements during the project lifecycle.  This will include a clear process for proposing, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes.

## 9. Deliverables

The requirements collection process will deliver the following:

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix**
* **Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)**
* **Non-Functional Requirements Specification (NFRS)**
* **Data Dictionary**
* **Updated Project Requirements Document** (incorporating all gathered requirements)
* **Stakeholder Sign-off on Requirements**


## 10. Conclusion

This comprehensive requirements collection process will ensure that the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project is developed to meet the needs of its intended users and stakeholders.  The iterative nature of the process, combined with the utilization of existing documentation and a strong emphasis on validation and verification, will minimize risks and maximize the chances of project success.
