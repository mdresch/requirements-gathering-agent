## Collect Requirements Process

This document outlines the process for collecting requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK standards.

### 1. Process Overview

**1.1 Purpose and Objectives:** The purpose of this process is to systematically gather, analyze, document, and validate all requirements necessary for the successful development and implementation of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  The objectives are to:

* Define a comprehensive set of functional and non-functional requirements.
* Ensure all stakeholder needs and expectations are captured.
* Create a traceable and verifiable requirements baseline.
* Establish a clear understanding of project scope and boundaries.

**1.2 Process Scope and Boundaries:** This process encompasses all activities related to gathering, analyzing, and documenting requirements, from initial stakeholder engagement to final requirements approval. It excludes the activities of requirements management (tracking, change control, etc.), which are addressed in a separate Requirements Management Plan.

**1.3 Integration with Other Project Processes:** This process directly integrates with:

* **Initiating:**  Input from the Project Charter and Business Case.
* **Planning:**  Provides input to the Scope Management Plan, Schedule Management Plan, and Risk Management Plan.
* **Executing:**  Supports the design and development phases.
* **Monitoring and Controlling:** Requirements traceability matrix facilitates monitoring and control of requirements changes.

**1.4 PMBOK Alignment:** This process aligns with the PMBOK Guide's Planning Process Group and the Requirements Management Knowledge Area.

### 2. Process Inputs

* **Project Charter:** Defines the high-level objectives, constraints, and stakeholders.
* **Business Case:** Provides justification for the project and outlines expected benefits.
* **Requirements Management Plan:** Outlines the approach for managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  (This document is an input *to* the Requirements Management Plan).
* **Stakeholder Register:** Lists all stakeholders involved in the project, their roles, and their interests.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identifies stakeholder influence and potential conflicts.
* **Relevant Project Documents:**  Existing documentation such as the README.md, architecture documents, and design specifications.


### 3. Tools and Techniques

**3.1 Data Gathering Techniques:**

* **Interviews:** One-on-one discussions with stakeholders to elicit requirements.
* **Focus Groups:** Group discussions to gather diverse perspectives.
* **Surveys:** Questionnaires to collect data from a large number of stakeholders.
* **Document Analysis:** Review of existing documentation to identify requirements.
* **Observation:** Observing users interacting with similar systems.

**3.2 Data Analysis Techniques:**

* **Document Analysis:** Analyzing existing documentation to identify implicit and explicit requirements.
* **Benchmarking:** Comparing the Requirements Gathering Agent to similar tools to identify best practices and potential requirements.
* **SWOT Analysis:** Identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the project.
* **Prioritization Matrices:** Techniques like MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) to prioritize requirements.

**3.3 Decision-Making Techniques:**

* **Voting:** Simple voting to prioritize requirements based on stakeholder consensus.
* **Prioritization Matrices:** Using matrices to rank requirements based on multiple criteria (e.g., value, effort, risk).
* **Decision Trees:** Visualizing decision paths to aid in requirement selection.

**3.4 Data Representation Techniques:**

* **Prototyping:** Creating working models to demonstrate requirements and gather feedback.
* **Storyboarding:** Visualizing user interactions and workflows.
* **Use Cases:** Describing user interactions with the system.
* **User Stories:** Short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability.

**3.5 Interpersonal and Team Skills:**

* **Facilitation:** Guiding requirements elicitation sessions effectively.
* **Negotiation:** Resolving conflicts between stakeholders with competing requirements.
* **Communication:** Clearly communicating requirements to all stakeholders.


### 4. Process Outputs

* **Requirements Documentation:** A comprehensive document detailing all approved requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, use cases, and acceptance criteria.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** A document linking requirements to design elements, test cases, and other project artifacts.  This ensures traceability throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Process Updates and Refinements:**  Any changes or improvements identified during the requirements collection process will be documented and incorporated into future iterations of this process.

### 5. Requirements Collection Activities

**5.1 Stakeholder Identification and Engagement:**

* Identify all stakeholders relevant to the project.
* Develop a communication plan to engage stakeholders effectively.
* Hold initial meetings to establish expectations and gather initial requirements.

**5.2 Requirements Elicitation Sessions:**

* Conduct workshops or interviews to collect detailed requirements from stakeholders.
* Use various elicitation techniques (interviews, brainstorming, prototyping) to gather comprehensive information.
* Document all requirements elicited during these sessions.

**5.3 Requirements Analysis and Validation:**

* Analyze collected requirements to identify gaps, conflicts, and ambiguities.
* Validate requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* Refine requirements based on feedback received during validation.

**5.4 Requirements Documentation and Approval:**

* Document all requirements in a consistent format (e.g., using a requirements management tool).
* Obtain formal approval of the requirements documentation from relevant stakeholders.


### 6. Quality Considerations

**6.1 Requirements Quality Criteria:**  Requirements should be:

* **Correct:**  Accurate and reflect stakeholder needs.
* **Unambiguous:** Clear and easily understood by all stakeholders.
* **Complete:**  Include all necessary information.
* **Consistent:**  Free from contradictions.
* **Feasible:**  Achievable within project constraints.
* **Necessary:**  Essential for meeting project objectives.
* **Traceable:**  Linked to other project artifacts.

**6.2 Validation and Verification Methods:**

* **Reviews:** Formal reviews of requirements documentation by stakeholders.
* **Prototyping:** Creating prototypes to validate requirements with users.
* **Walkthroughs:** Informal reviews of requirements with stakeholders.

**6.3 Review and Approval Processes:**  A formal process will be established for reviewing and approving requirements documentation, including sign-off by key stakeholders.

**6.4 Continuous Improvement Approaches:**  The requirements collection process will be continuously reviewed and improved based on lessons learned from past projects.


### 7. Process Metrics

* **Number of requirements collected.**
* **Number of requirements changed or rejected.**
* **Time spent on requirements elicitation and analysis.**
* **Number of stakeholder meetings held.**
* **Requirement completeness and accuracy.**
* **Stakeholder satisfaction with the requirements process.**

### 8. Risk Management

**8.1 Requirements-Related Risks:**

* **Incomplete requirements:**  Failure to capture all necessary requirements.
* **Ambiguous requirements:**  Requirements that are unclear or open to interpretation.
* **Conflicting requirements:**  Requirements that contradict each other.
* **Unrealistic requirements:**  Requirements that cannot be met within project constraints.
