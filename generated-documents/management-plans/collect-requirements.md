# Collect Requirements Process

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Purpose:** This document outlines the process for collecting requirements for the ADPA project, ensuring all necessary information is gathered to successfully develop and deliver the software.  The process emphasizes leveraging the ADPA's own capabilities where appropriate for iterative refinement and validation.

**2. Scope:** This process covers the elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for all aspects of the ADPA project, including:

* **Core Functionality:**  Generation of PMBOK-compliant project documents from README files and other project documentation.
* **AI Integration:**  Seamless integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
* **Enhanced Context Management:**  Implementation of the 3-phase context strategy for optimal AI performance.
* **Technical Design Documentation System:** Generation of 10 specialized technical design documents.
* **Business Communication Translator:** Generation of strategic business documents (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.).
* **User Interface:**  Command-line interface (CLI) and user experience.
* **Validation and Quality Assurance:**  PMBOK 7.0 compliance and document quality assessment.
* **Version Control System:**  Git integration for generated documents.
* **Future Enhancements:**  Scalability, modularity, and extensibility.


**3. Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the requirements gathering process, ensures stakeholder alignment, and manages the requirements documentation.
* **AI Engineer:**  Responsible for integrating and optimizing the AI providers, implementing the enhanced context manager, and ensuring efficient AI processing.
* **Software Engineer:** Designs, develops, tests, and deploys the ADPA software.
* **Business Analyst:**  Collaborates with stakeholders to elicit requirements, analyzes needs, and ensures alignment with business objectives.
* **Stakeholders:** Provide input and feedback on requirements, validate generated documents, and ensure alignment with their needs.

**4. Requirements Elicitation Techniques:**

The ADPA project will employ a mixed approach to requirements elicitation, leveraging both automated and manual methods:

* **Automated Requirements Gathering (ADPA Self-Analysis):** ADPA will analyze its own README and associated documentation to establish initial requirements.  This will provide a baseline for further refinement.  This will be documented in `generated-documents/requirements/initial_requirements.md`.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Structured interviews with key stakeholders (Project Managers, Business Analysts, End-Users) to gather detailed requirements and clarify ambiguities.
* **Document Analysis:** Review of existing project documentation (e.g., project charters, scope statements, design documents) to identify implicit requirements.
* **Prototyping and User Feedback:**  Development of prototypes and iterative feedback cycles to validate requirements and improve user experience.
* **ADPA-Generated Requirements Validation:** The generated requirements documents (from ADPA self-analysis and stakeholder input) will be reviewed and validated by stakeholders.  This iterative process will be documented in `generated-documents/requirements/validation_log.md`.


**5. Requirements Analysis and Specification:**

* **Requirements Prioritization:**  Requirements will be prioritized based on business value, risk, and dependencies.  A prioritization matrix will be developed and documented in `generated-documents/requirements/prioritization_matrix.md`.
* **Requirements Decomposition:**  High-level requirements will be decomposed into smaller, more manageable tasks.  This decomposition will be reflected in the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
* **Requirements Traceability:**  A traceability matrix will be maintained to link requirements to design, code, and test cases.  This matrix will be documented in `generated-documents/requirements/traceability_matrix.md`.
* **Requirements Documentation:**  All requirements will be formally documented using a consistent format (e.g., User Stories, Use Cases, Requirements Specifications), stored in the `requirements` directory.


**6. Requirements Validation:**

* **Formal Reviews:**  Regular reviews of requirements documentation with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
* **Prototyping and Testing:**  Development and testing of prototypes to validate requirements and identify any inconsistencies or gaps.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Check:**  Validation of the generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Automated Validation (ADPA Self-Validation):** ADPA will be used to generate validation reports, ensuring that the system is meeting its own requirements.  This report will be located in `generated-documents/validation/self_validation_report.md`.


**7. Requirements Management:**

* **Version Control:**  Requirements documentation will be managed using a version control system (Git) to track changes and maintain a history of revisions.
* **Change Management:**  A formal change management process will be implemented to handle requests for changes to requirements.  This process will be documented in `generated-documents/requirements/change_management_process.md`.
* **Requirements Repository:**  A central repository will be used to store all requirements documentation and related artifacts.


**8. Exit Criteria:**

The requirements gathering process is complete when:

* All stakeholders have reviewed and approved the requirements documentation.
* All requirements have been prioritized and decomposed into manageable tasks.
* A traceability matrix has been established to link requirements to design, code, and test cases.
* The requirements have been validated against PMBOK 7.0 standards and through prototyping and testing.
* A comprehensive requirements management plan is in place.


**9.  Iteration and Refinement:**  The requirements gathering process is iterative.  Feedback from testing, prototyping, and stakeholder reviews will be incorporated to refine the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  ADPA's ability to generate documents from refined information will be leveraged to facilitate this process.

This process ensures a structured and comprehensive approach to requirements gathering, leveraging the unique capabilities of the ADPA tool itself to accelerate the process and enhance the quality of the final product.
