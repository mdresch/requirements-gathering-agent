# Collectrequirementsprocess

**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Document Owner:** ADPA Product & Business Analysis Team  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

## 1. Purpose

The Collect Requirements process for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework defines the systematic approach for gathering, analyzing, and managing requirements from diverse stakeholders to ensure successful delivery of enterprise-grade, standards-compliant document automation solutions. This process ensures alignment with business analysis and project management best practices (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7, DMBOK 2), regulatory compliance, and enterprise integration needs.

---

## 2. Process Overview

The process leverages both AI-powered automation and structured stakeholder engagement to elicit, document, validate, and baseline functional and non-functional requirements. It is tailored for large-scale, regulated, and integration-heavy enterprise environments, supporting multiple input channels (CLI, REST API, Admin Web UI), and accommodating industry frameworks and regulatory standards.

---

## 3. Inputs

- **Business Case, Project Charter, and Initial Scope Documents**
- **Stakeholder Register and Analysis**
- **Existing Standards and Frameworks:** BABOK v3, PMBOK 7, DMBOK 2.0, regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.)
- **Technical Constraints:** Platform, integration endpoints (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, etc.), security requirements
- **Organizational Process Assets:** Templates, historical data, lessons learned

---

## 4. Tools & Techniques

- **ADPA Document Generator:** Template-driven, standards-compliant document creation
- **AI Provider Integration:** Context-aware requirement elicitation using OpenAI, Google AI, Copilot, Ollama
- **REST API & CLI:** Multi-modal requirements submission and management
- **Confluence/SharePoint Integration:** Direct publishing for collaborative review
- **Workshops & Interviews:** Facilitated by business analysts, leveraging ADPA-generated guides
- **Surveys & Questionnaires:** Automated distribution and analysis
- **Prototyping & Mockups:** Generated via Adobe Document Services for visual requirement validation
- **Approval & Traceability Workflows:** Built-in role-based access (Active Directory, SAML, OAuth2)

---

## 5. Process Steps

### 5.1 Preparation

- **Identify Stakeholders:** Use the Stakeholder Analysis module, synchronize with Active Directory or manual input.
- **Select Standards/Frameworks:** Determine which (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK) are applicable; configure in ADPA.
- **Establish Document Types:** Define which documents are required (e.g., Requirements Specification, Risk Register, Data Governance Plan).

### 5.2 Requirement Elicitation

- **AI-Assisted Workshops:**  
  - Use ADPA’s guided templates and AI context management to structure sessions.
  - Capture requirements in real time via CLI, API, or Admin Web UI.
- **Surveys & Forms:**  
  - Distribute via integrated channels, auto-ingest responses.
- **Document Analysis:**  
  - Upload existing documents for AI-powered extraction and synthesis.

### 5.3 Requirement Documentation

- **Template-Based Generation:**  
  - Select or customize standards-compliant templates (e.g., BABOK Requirements Elicitation).
  - Auto-populate with elicited content, stakeholder data, and traceability links.
- **Formatting & Output:**  
  - Generate outputs in Markdown, PDF, or JSON.
  - Publish directly to Confluence, SharePoint, or export locally.

### 5.4 Requirement Validation

- **Stakeholder Review:**  
  - Distribute generated documents via email, Confluence, or SharePoint for review.
  - Capture feedback through ADPA’s integrated feedback mechanisms.
- **Automated Consistency Checks:**  
  - Use AI to flag conflicting, vague, or incomplete requirements.
- **Approval Workflow:**  
  - Route documents for electronic sign-off via integrated identity management.

### 5.5 Requirement Management

- **Version Control:**  
  - Track all changes via built-in VCS integration (GitHub, Azure DevOps).
- **Change Management:**  
  - Log, review, and approve requirement changes; maintain traceability matrix.
- **Audit & Compliance:**  
  - Automated logging and regulatory audit trail generation for all requirement activities.

---

## 6. Outputs

- **Requirements Documentation:**  
  - Baseline requirements specification (BABOK/PMBOK/DMBOK compliant)
  - Traceability matrix
  - Stakeholder analysis and approval records
  - Integration-ready output (API, CLI, or document export)
- **Regulatory Compliance Artifacts:**  
  - Evidence of GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, and other standard adherence, auto-generated as needed
- **Versioned & Auditable Requirement Sets:**  
  - All requirement artifacts are versioned, signed, and accessible for audit

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Business Analyst      | Lead requirement elicitation and documentation    |
| Project Manager       | Ensure requirements align with scope and schedule |
| Technical Lead        | Validate technical feasibility and constraints    |
| Stakeholders          | Provide inputs and approve requirements           |
| Compliance Officer    | Validate regulatory adherence                     |
| AI Orchestration Lead | Configure and monitor AI provider integrations    |

## 8. Unique Project Considerations

- **AI-Driven Contextualization:**  
  Leverage multi-provider AI for dynamic, context-aware requirement gathering and smart document population.
- **API-First, Multi-Modal Input:**  
  Accept requirements via CLI, REST API, or Web UI for maximum flexibility.
- **Enterprise Integration:**  
  Direct hooks to Confluence, SharePoint, and version control for seamless enterprise workflow.
- **Full Standards Coverage:**  
  Templates and requirements management aligned to BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK, and evolving regulatory standards.
- **Security and Compliance:**  
  All requirements handling is secured, logged, and audit-ready; supports SSO and granular permissions.

---

## 9. Practical Guidance

- **Configure AI providers and frameworks before workshops to maximize automation.**
- **Use built-in template libraries as a starting point; customize as needed for unique business domains.**
- **Publish and manage requirements through integrated enterprise tools to streamline collaboration and approvals.**
- **Leverage automated checks and traceability to minimize risk of incomplete or conflicting requirements.**
- **Utilize ADPA’s analytics and reporting features for continuous improvement of the requirements process.**
