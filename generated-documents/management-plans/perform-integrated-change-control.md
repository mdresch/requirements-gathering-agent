## Perform Integrated Change Control for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the Perform Integrated Change Control process for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.

**1. Identify Change:**

* **Method:** Changes are identified through various channels including:
    * **Stakeholder Requests:**  Formal requests from stakeholders (e.g., feature requests, bug reports) submitted via a designated change request form.  The form should include a description of the change, justification, impact assessment, and priority.
    * **Project Team Identification:**  The project team identifies changes during project execution (e.g., risks realized, scope creep, technical issues).  These are documented using the same change request form.
    * **Regular Reviews:**  Change requests are reviewed during project status meetings and other relevant meetings.
    * **Issue Tracking System:** A dedicated issue tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) is used to manage and track change requests.
* **Documentation:**  All change requests are documented using a standardized change request form, including a unique identifier, date submitted, submitter, description, justification, impact analysis (schedule, cost, quality, risk), priority, and proposed solution.

**2. Evaluate Change:**

* **Process:** The Change Control Board (CCB), comprising stakeholders with decision-making authority (e.g., Project Manager, Product Owner, Technical Lead), evaluates each change request.  The evaluation includes:
    * **Impact Assessment:**  A thorough assessment of the impact of the change on project scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risks.
    * **Feasibility Analysis:**  Determining the technical feasibility and practicality of implementing the change.
    * **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Evaluating the costs and benefits of implementing the change against the potential risks.
    * **Prioritization:**  Ranking change requests based on urgency, impact, and alignment with project objectives.
* **Documentation:**  The CCB documents their evaluation and decision for each change request, including rationale and any associated risks.

**3. Approve or Reject Change:**

* **Process:** The CCB formally approves or rejects the change request based on the evaluation.  Approval requires a documented decision with justification and assigned resources. Rejection includes a documented explanation.
* **Documentation:**  The decision (approval or rejection) is formally documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.  Approved changes are added to the project's integrated change control system.

**4. Implement Approved Change:**

* **Process:**  The project team implements approved changes according to the approved change request.  This may involve updating project documents, adjusting the schedule, allocating resources, and performing necessary testing and validation.  The implementation process should adhere to the project's quality management plan.
* **Documentation:**  The implementation process is documented, including any updates to project plans, code, or other relevant documents.  Testing results and validation are also documented.

**5. Verify Implemented Change:**

* **Process:**  After implementation, the project team verifies that the change has been successfully implemented and meets the requirements outlined in the approved change request.  This involves testing the change and validating that it functions as expected and doesn't introduce new issues.
* **Documentation:**  Verification results, including test reports and validation data, are documented.

**6. Update Project Management Plan:**

* **Process:**  The project management plan is updated to reflect the approved changes. This includes updates to the scope statement, schedule, budget, and risk register.
* **Documentation:**  The updated project management plan is formally documented and distributed to all relevant stakeholders.

**7. Close Change Request:**

* **Process:**  Once the change has been implemented, verified, and the project management plan updated, the change request is formally closed.
* **Documentation:**  The change request is marked as closed in the change management system, along with a summary of the implementation and verification results.

**Change Control Board (CCB) Composition:**

* Project Manager (Chair)
* Product Owner
* Lead Developer
* QA Lead
* Relevant Stakeholders (as needed)


**Tools and Techniques:**

* Change Request Form
* Project Management Software (e.g., Jira, Asana)
* Issue Tracking System (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues)
* Version Control System (e.g., Git)


This process ensures that all changes are properly managed, controlled, and documented, minimizing disruptions and maintaining project integrity.  Regular review of the change control process is essential to ensure its effectiveness and adapt it to evolving project needs.
