## Perform Integrated Change Control for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the Perform Integrated Change Control process for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The process will be iterative and adapt as the project progresses.

**1. Identify Change:**

* **Source:** Changes can originate from various sources, including:
    * **Stakeholders:** Requests for new features, modifications to existing features, or changes to project requirements.  This includes feedback from the 175 weekly downloads milestone report (MILESTONE-175-DOWNLOADS.md).
    * **Project Team:** Identification of risks, issues, or defects requiring corrective actions.  This includes any issues identified in the `CHANGELOG.md` file, particularly those marked as “Bug Fixes” and “Improvements.”
    * **Project Management Office (PMO):** Directives, policy changes, or resource allocation adjustments.
    * **External Factors:** Changes in market conditions, technology, or regulations.

* **Documentation:** All change requests will be documented using a standardized Change Request Form (CRF).  The CRF will include:
    * Unique identifier
    * Date submitted
    * Requestor
    * Description of the change
    * Justification for the change
    * Impact assessment (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk)
    * Proposed solution
    * Priority

**2. Evaluate Change Request:**

* **Change Control Board (CCB):** A CCB will be established, comprising key stakeholders (Project Manager, Development Lead, Product Owner, PMO representative).
* **Evaluation Criteria:** The CCB will evaluate each CRF based on:
    * Alignment with project objectives
    * Feasibility
    * Impact on project constraints (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk)
    * Risk assessment
    * Cost-benefit analysis

* **Documentation:** The CCB's evaluation and decision will be documented in the CRF, including rationale for approval or rejection.

**3. Approve or Reject Change Request:**

* **Decision:** The CCB will make a decision to approve, reject, or defer the change request.  Deferral will require a clear rationale and a defined review date.
* **Notification:** The requestor will be notified of the CCB's decision.

**4. Integrate Change:**

* **Update Project Documents:** If approved, the change will be integrated into the relevant project documents (e.g., project charter, scope statement, WBS, schedule, budget).  This will be tracked using the version control system (VCS) built into the Requirements Gathering Agent (see README).
* **Configuration Management:** Changes to the software will be managed through a formal configuration management system, including version control, testing, and deployment procedures.  The modular processor architecture will facilitate change implementation.
* **Communication:** Stakeholders will be informed of the approved change and its impact.
* **Documentation:** All changes and their integration will be documented in the CRF and project management logs.

**5. Monitor and Control Integrated Changes:**

* **Tracking:** The impact of the integrated change will be monitored and tracked against the project baseline. This includes reviewing the `context-report`, `context-metrics`, and `analyze-context` outputs for assessing the impact on context utilization and model performance.
* **Variance Analysis:** Any deviations from the baseline will be analyzed and addressed through corrective actions, if necessary.  This includes monitoring for any issues reported in the `CHANGELOG.md` file related to the integrated change.
* **Lessons Learned:** Lessons learned from the change management process will be documented and used to improve future change management processes.
