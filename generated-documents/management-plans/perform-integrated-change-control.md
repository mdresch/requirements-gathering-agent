# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

This document outlines the process for managing and controlling changes impacting the integration aspects of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This includes changes to the integration with AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama), Azure services (Azure Identity, Azure AI Inference), and any potential third-party project management tools.

**1.  Change Request Submission:**

* **Method:**  Changes are submitted via a formal change request form (see Appendix A).  This form requires a detailed description of the proposed change, its impact on the existing integration, justification for the change, and an estimated cost and timeline.
* **Initiator:** Any stakeholder (developer, project manager, client) can initiate a change request.
* **Distribution:** The change request is submitted to the Integration Change Control Board (ICCB) (see Section 3).

**2. Change Request Evaluation:**

* **ICCB Review:** The ICCB reviews the change request, assessing its feasibility, impact on project timelines and budget, and alignment with project objectives.  This includes a technical assessment of the integration implications.
* **Impact Analysis:** A detailed impact analysis is performed, considering potential effects on existing integrations, data integrity, security, and performance.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Risks associated with the change are identified and evaluated. Mitigation strategies are developed and documented.
* **Decision:** The ICCB approves, rejects, or requests modifications to the change request.  The decision is documented and communicated to the requestor.

**3. Integration Change Control Board (ICCB):**

* **Membership:** The ICCB comprises representatives from the development team (lead architect, integration specialist), project management, and relevant stakeholders (e.g., client representative if applicable).
* **Responsibilities:** The ICCB is responsible for reviewing, evaluating, and approving/rejecting change requests related to integrations.
* **Meeting Frequency:** Meetings are held as needed, based on the volume of change requests.

**4. Change Implementation:**

* **Approved Changes:**  For approved changes, a detailed implementation plan is created, outlining tasks, responsibilities, timelines, and testing procedures.
* **Version Control:** All code changes are managed using Git, with clear commit messages detailing the change and its corresponding change request ID.
* **Testing:**  Thorough testing is conducted to ensure the integration continues to function correctly after the change is implemented. This includes unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT) where appropriate.  Test cases are documented in Appendix B.
* **Documentation Update:**  All relevant documentation (e.g., architecture diagrams, integration specifications) is updated to reflect the change.

**5. Change Closure:**

* **Verification:** Once testing is complete and the change is verified, the change request is closed.
* **Post-Implementation Review:** A post-implementation review is conducted to assess the effectiveness of the change and identify any lessons learned.  This review is documented and shared with the ICCB.

**6. Change Request Tracking:**

* **System:** A change request tracking system (e.g., a spreadsheet, a project management tool) is used to track the status of all change requests.
* **Reporting:** Regular reports are generated to monitor the status of change requests and overall change management effectiveness.

**Appendix A: Change Request Form**

**(Include a detailed form template here, with fields for: Change Request ID, Date Submitted, Requestor, Description of Change, Justification, Impact Assessment, Risk Assessment, Proposed Solution, Cost Estimate, Timeline, Approval/Rejection Status, and Approver Signature.)**

**Appendix B: Test Cases**

**(Include a detailed list of test cases for verifying the integration after a change is implemented.  These should cover both positive and negative scenarios, and address different integration points.)**


This process ensures that changes to the Requirements Gathering Agent's integrations are managed effectively, minimizing disruption and maximizing the chances of successful implementation.  The specific tools and techniques used for change management might be adjusted based on the project's needs and available resources.  However, the core principles of change control – request, evaluation, implementation, and closure – remain crucial.
