## Perform Integrated Change Control for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the Perform Integrated Change Control process for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The process will manage changes to the project scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risks.

**1.  Identify and Document Changes:**

* **Method:** Changes will be identified through various channels, including:
    * **Stakeholder Requests:**  Formal requests from stakeholders (using a standardized change request form).
    * **Issue Log:**  Issues identified during project execution that require changes.
    * **Risk Register:**  Triggered responses to identified risks.
    * **Project Team Meetings:**  Discussions and decisions made during regular project meetings.
    * **Defect Tracking System:** Bugs and defects found during testing.
* **Documentation:** Each change will be documented using a standardized Change Request Form including:
    * **Change Request ID:** Unique identifier.
    * **Date Submitted:** Date of submission.
    * **Requester:** Name and contact information of the person requesting the change.
    * **Description of Change:** Clear and concise description of the proposed change.
    * **Impact Assessment:** Analysis of the change's impact on scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, and risks.  This should include quantitative data where possible.
    * **Proposed Solution:** Description of how the change will be implemented.
    * **Cost Estimate:** Estimate of the cost to implement the change.
    * **Schedule Impact:** Estimate of the impact on the project schedule.
    * **Risk Assessment:** Assessment of the risks associated with implementing the change.
    * **Priority:**  Prioritization of the change request (High, Medium, Low).
    * **Approval Status:** Tracks the approval status of the change request.


**2. Change Request Review and Analysis:**

* **Change Control Board (CCB):**  A CCB will be established consisting of key stakeholders (Project Manager, Development Lead, Product Owner, etc.).
* **Review Process:** The CCB will review each change request, considering its impact and feasibility.
* **Analysis:** The CCB will analyze the impact assessment, proposed solution, cost estimate, schedule impact, and risk assessment.  They will consider the project's constraints and objectives.
* **Documentation:** The CCB's review and analysis will be documented in the change request form.

**3. Change Request Evaluation and Approval:**

* **Decision Criteria:**  The CCB will use pre-defined criteria to evaluate change requests. These criteria should align with the project's goals and constraints.
* **Approval Authority:**  The CCB will have the authority to approve, reject, or defer change requests.  For significant changes, escalation to higher management might be necessary.
* **Documentation:**  The CCB's decision (approved, rejected, deferred) and rationale will be documented in the change request form.

**4. Change Implementation:**

* **Integration:** Approved changes will be integrated into the project plan.  This may involve updating the WBS, schedule, budget, and other project documents.
* **Communication:**  The project team will be notified of the approved changes and their impact.
* **Tracking:** The implementation of the change will be tracked and monitored.

**5. Change Verification and Closure:**

* **Verification:** Once the change is implemented, it will be verified to ensure that it meets the requirements and has not introduced any new issues.  Testing will be crucial.
* **Closure:** The change request will be closed once the change has been verified and the project documents updated.
* **Lessons Learned:**  The entire change process will be reviewed to identify lessons learned and improve future change management.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Change Request Form (Template):**  A standardized form for documenting change requests.
* **Project Management Software:**  Software to track change requests and manage the project plan. (e.g., Jira, Asana, MS Project)
* **CCB Meeting Minutes:**  Records of CCB meetings, decisions, and discussions.
* **Impact Analysis Matrix:**  A tool to assess the impact of changes on different project aspects.
* **Risk Management Plan:**  Identifies and mitigates risks associated with change implementation.

**Change Request Categories:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent project will categorize change requests for better tracking and analysis:

* **Scope Changes:** Additions, deletions, or modifications to the project scope.
* **Schedule Changes:** Changes to the project schedule, including deadlines and milestones.
* **Cost Changes:** Changes to the project budget.
* **Quality Changes:** Changes to the project quality standards.
* **Resource Changes:** Changes to the project resources, including personnel, equipment, and materials.
* **Risk Changes:** Changes to the project's risk profile.

This comprehensive Perform Integrated Change Control process will ensure that changes to the Requirements Gathering Agent project are managed effectively, minimizing disruption and maximizing the likelihood of project success.  Regular reviews of the process will ensure its ongoing effectiveness and adaptation to changing project needs.
