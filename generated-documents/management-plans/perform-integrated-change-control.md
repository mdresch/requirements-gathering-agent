# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicles (SCEV)

This document outlines the process for managing changes to the integration of the various energy harvesting systems within the SCEV project.  This process adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines for managing changes and integrates specific considerations for the unique technological challenges of this project.

**1.0 Purpose:**

This process ensures that any changes to the integration of the photovoltaic body panels, regenerative suspension system, thermoelectric generation (TEG) units, and the AI-powered Energy Management Unit (EMU) are properly evaluated, approved, and implemented, minimizing disruption and maintaining project integrity.

**2.0 Process:**

**2.1 Change Request Submission:**

Any proposed change to the integration must be formally submitted using the "SCEV Integration Change Request Form" (Appendix A).  The form requires:

* **Change Description:** A clear and concise description of the proposed change, including its rationale and impact on other system components.
* **Proposed Solution:** A detailed explanation of how the change will be implemented.
* **Impact Assessment:** An assessment of the potential impact on schedule, cost, and functionality. This should include consideration of:
    * **Technical Feasibility:**  Can the change be implemented with existing resources and technology?
    * **Integration Compatibility:** Will the change affect the functionality or performance of other integrated systems?
    * **Testing Requirements:** What testing is required to validate the change?
* **Requester Information:** Name, role, and contact information of the person requesting the change.

**2.2 Change Request Review:**

The Integration Change Control Board (ICCB) (membership listed in Appendix B) will review all change requests.  The ICCB will assess the request based on the information provided in the form and may request additional information or clarification.  The review process will consider:

* **Alignment with Project Objectives:** Does the change support the overall project goals?
* **Risk Assessment:** What are the potential risks associated with implementing the change?
* **Resource Availability:** Are the necessary resources (time, budget, personnel) available?
* **Technical Viability:** Is the proposed solution technically sound and feasible?


**2.3 Change Request Approval/Rejection:**

The ICCB will approve or reject the change request.  Approval will be documented and communicated to the requester. Rejected requests will include justification for the rejection.

**2.4 Change Implementation:**

Approved changes will be implemented according to the approved solution.  This will include:

* **Configuration Management:**  Updating relevant documentation (design specifications, integration plans, etc.).
* **Testing:**  Thorough testing to verify the functionality and performance of the integrated system after the change.  This will include unit testing of individual components and integration testing of the entire system.  Specific testing protocols are defined in Appendix C.
* **Version Control:**  Maintaining version control of all software and hardware components using a robust system (e.g., Git).

**2.5 Change Verification and Closure:**

After implementation and testing, the change will be verified to ensure it meets the requirements and has not introduced any unintended consequences.  The change request will then be formally closed.

**3.0 Documentation:**

All change requests, approvals, implementations, and verification results will be documented and maintained in the project's change management system.


**4.0 Communication:**

Regular updates on the status of change requests will be communicated to relevant stakeholders.

* **Appendix C:** Integration Testing Protocols


**Note:** This process is iterative and will be refined as the project progresses and more experience is gained.  Regular reviews of this process will be conducted by the project management team.  The unique nature of integrating multiple energy harvesting systems requires a rigorous change control process to ensure the system's overall stability and efficiency.  Any deviation from this process requires explicit approval from the Project Manager.
