## Perform Integrated Change Control for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the Perform Integrated Change Control process for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The process will be iterative and responsive to the evolving needs of the project.

**1. Identify Change:**

* **Source:** Changes can originate from various sources, including:
    * **Stakeholders:** Requests for new features, modifications to existing features, or changes in priorities.  This includes feedback from the 175 weekly downloads milestone report and user feedback from GitHub issues and discussions.
    * **Project Team:** Identification of risks, issues, or defects requiring corrective action.  This includes findings from testing and validation reports.
    * **External Factors:** Changes in technology, regulations, or market conditions.  For example, changes in Azure OpenAI pricing or API limitations.
* **Documentation:** All change requests will be documented using a standardized Change Request Form (CRF).  The CRF will include:
    * Change Request ID
    * Date Submitted
    * Requestor
    * Description of the Change
    * Justification for the Change
    * Impact Assessment (Schedule, Cost, Scope, Quality, Risk)
    * Proposed Solution
    * Priority
    * Approval Status

**2.  Change Request Review:**

* **Change Control Board (CCB):** A CCB will be established, consisting of representatives from key stakeholders (developers, PM, product owner).
* **Review Criteria:** The CCB will evaluate each CRF based on:
    * Alignment with project objectives
    * Feasibility of implementation
    * Impact on project schedule, budget, and resources
    * Risk assessment
    * Compliance with PMBOK standards
* **Decision:** The CCB will approve, reject, or defer the change request.  The decision and rationale will be documented.

**3. Change Implementation:**

* **Approved Changes:** For approved changes, a detailed implementation plan will be created, including tasks, responsibilities, timelines, and resource allocation.  This plan will be integrated into the project management plan.
* **Configuration Management:**  The change will be implemented through the version control system (Git), adhering to established branching and merging strategies.
* **Testing:** Thorough testing will be conducted to ensure the implemented change meets requirements and doesn't introduce new defects. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

**4. Change Verification and Validation:**

* **Verification:** Confirmation that the implemented change conforms to the approved specifications.  This will involve reviewing the code, test results, and documentation.
* **Validation:** Confirmation that the implemented change meets the intended purpose and satisfies stakeholder needs.  This will involve UAT and feedback from stakeholders.

**5. Change Closure:**

* **Documentation:** The change implementation process, test results, and verification/validation results will be documented.
* **Update Project Documents:** The project management plan, schedule, budget, and other relevant documents will be updated to reflect the implemented change.
* **Lessons Learned:**  A post-implementation review will be conducted to identify lessons learned and improve future change management processes.


**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Change Request Form (CRF):**  A standardized form for capturing change requests.
* **CCB Meetings:** Regular meetings to review and approve change requests.
* **Project Management Software:**  (e.g., Jira, Asana) to track changes, tasks, and progress.
* **Version Control System (Git):**  To manage code changes and maintain version history.
* **Test Management Tool:** (e.g., TestRail) to manage testing activities.


**Metrics:**

* **Number of Change Requests:** Track the volume of change requests over time.
* **Change Request Cycle Time:** Measure the time it takes to process a change request from submission to closure.
* **Change Request Approval Rate:** Monitor the percentage of change requests approved.
* **Defect Rate After Change Implementation:** Track the number of defects introduced after a change is implemented.


This Perform Integrated Change Control process ensures that changes are managed effectively, minimizing disruption to the project and maximizing the likelihood of successful project delivery.  The process will be reviewed and refined regularly based on project experience and lessons learned.  The specific tools and techniques may be adjusted based on project needs and available resources.
