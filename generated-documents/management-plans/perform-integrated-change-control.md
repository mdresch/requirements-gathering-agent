# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

This document outlines the process for managing integration changes within the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This process adheres to best practices derived from PMBOK and ensures the integrity and stability of the system while accommodating necessary modifications.

**1.0 Initiation of Change Request:**

* **Triggering Events:** Any proposed change to the system's integrations (e.g., new AI provider, updated API endpoint, altered data schema) must be initiated via a formal change request.  This can be done through a designated issue tracker (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) or a change request form.
* **Request Content:** The change request must include:
    * **Change Description:** A clear and concise description of the proposed change, including its purpose and impact.
    * **Justification:** A rationale explaining the need for the change, including business benefits and potential risks.
    * **Impact Assessment:** A preliminary assessment of the impact on other system components, performance, and timelines.
    * **Proposed Solution:** A detailed description of the proposed implementation, including technical specifications and dependencies.
    * **Testing Plan:** A plan outlining the testing procedures to validate the implemented change.
    * **Rollback Plan:** A plan detailing how to revert the change if necessary.
    * **Requested Completion Date:** A realistic estimate of the completion date.
* **Request Submission:** Change requests are submitted to the designated change control board (CCB) for review and approval.

**2.0 Change Request Evaluation:**

* **CCB Review:** The CCB assesses the change request based on the provided information. This includes verifying the justification, evaluating the impact assessment, and reviewing the proposed solution and testing plan.
* **Prioritization:** The CCB prioritizes change requests based on urgency, impact, and feasibility.
* **Approval/Rejection:** The CCB approves or rejects the change request.  Rejection requires a clear explanation of the reasons.  Approved requests are assigned a unique change request ID.

**3.0 Change Implementation:**

* **Implementation Plan:** Upon approval, a detailed implementation plan is created, outlining the tasks, responsibilities, and timelines.
* **Development & Testing:** The development team implements the change according to the approved plan.  Thorough testing is performed, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, to ensure the change functions correctly and does not introduce new defects. The testing plan from the change request is followed rigorously.
* **Version Control:** All changes are managed using a robust version control system (e.g., Git) to track modifications, facilitate rollback, and maintain code integrity.

**4.0 Change Verification & Closure:**

* **Verification:** Once testing is complete, the CCB verifies that the change meets the requirements and has been successfully implemented. This may involve a formal sign-off process.
* **Documentation Update:** Project documentation (including architecture diagrams, API specifications, and user manuals) is updated to reflect the implemented change.
* **Closure:**  The change request is formally closed once verification is complete.  Lessons learned are documented for future reference.

**5.0 Change Request Tracking & Reporting:**

* **Centralized Repository:** A centralized repository (e.g., a project management tool) is used to track all change requests, their status, and related documentation.
* **Regular Reporting:** Regular reports are generated to monitor the status of open change requests and identify potential issues.

**6.0 Emergency Changes:**

Emergency changes, required to address critical issues, follow an expedited process.  While the formal steps are still adhered to, the review and approval cycles may be shortened with appropriate authorization.  Post-incident reviews are mandatory to assess the situation and prevent similar issues in the future.


**7.0 Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **CCB (Change Control Board):** Responsible for reviewing, approving, and monitoring change requests.  Members include representatives from development, testing, operations, and business stakeholders.
* **Project Manager:** Oversees the change management process and ensures adherence to established procedures.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing and testing approved changes.
* **Testing Team:** Responsible for verifying the functionality and quality of implemented changes.


This process ensures that all integration changes are carefully managed, minimizing disruption and maximizing the value of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  Regular reviews of this process will ensure its continued effectiveness.
