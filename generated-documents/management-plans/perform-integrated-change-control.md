# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**1. Purpose:** This document outlines the process for managing and controlling changes to the integration components within the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project.  This process ensures that changes are properly evaluated, approved, and implemented while maintaining system stability, security, and compliance with project goals and industry standards (PMBOK 7th Edition).

**2. Scope:** This process covers all changes impacting the integrations with external systems, including but not limited to:

* **AI Providers:** OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama
* **Document Management Systems:** Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services
* **Identity Management Systems:** Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Active Directory, SAML providers.
* **Other Enterprise Systems:** Jira, Azure DevOps, ServiceNow (future integrations)

**3. Process Steps:**

**3.1. Change Request Submission:**

* All integration changes must be initiated through a formal change request. This can be submitted via the ADPA admin interface, or, if unavailable, via email to the designated change management team.
* The change request must include:
    * **Requestor:** Name and contact information.
    * **Description:** Clear and concise description of the proposed change, including its purpose and impact.
    * **Justification:** Explanation of the business need for the change and its benefits.
    * **Impact Assessment:** Preliminary assessment of the potential impact on other systems, performance, security, and compliance.  This should include potential risks and mitigation strategies.
    * **Proposed Solution:** Detailed description of the proposed solution, including technical specifications where applicable.
    * **Timeline:** Estimated time required for implementation and testing.
    * **Resources:** Required resources (personnel, tools, etc.).
    * **Priority:**  Prioritization based on business impact and urgency.

**3.2. Change Request Review and Evaluation:**

* The change management team reviews the change request and assesses its feasibility, impact, and risk.
* This may involve consultation with relevant stakeholders (e.g., integration engineers, security team, compliance officers).
* A thorough impact analysis is conducted using available tools and expertise to assess the impact across all affected areas.
* The review team provides a recommendation for approval or rejection, along with any necessary modifications to the proposed solution.

**3.3. Change Request Approval:**

* The approved change request is documented with the appropriate approvals based on the project's authority matrix.
* This might involve different levels of approval depending on the scope and impact of the change (e.g., minor changes may only require team lead approval, while major changes may require project manager or steering committee approval).

**3.4. Change Implementation:**

* The change is implemented according to the approved change request and documented implementation plan.
* This involves rigorous testing and quality assurance procedures to ensure that the change functions as intended and does not negatively impact other systems.
* Version control is strictly enforced throughout this process using Git or a similar system.

**3.5. Change Verification and Closure:**

* After implementation, the change is verified to ensure it meets the requirements outlined in the approved change request.
* This involves thorough testing and validation by the integration team.
* Documentation is updated to reflect the implemented changes.
* The change request is officially closed, and any associated documentation is archived.

**4. Tools and Technologies:**

* **ADPA Admin Interface:**  Provides a centralized platform for change request submission, tracking, and approval.
* **Version Control System (Git):**  Manages code changes and ensures traceability.
* **Issue Tracking System (e.g., Jira):** Tracks bugs and issues related to integration changes.
* **Automated Testing Framework:** Ensures thorough testing of integration changes.

**5. Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Change Requestor:** Submits change requests.
* **Change Management Team:** Reviews, evaluates, and approves change requests.
* **Integration Engineers:** Implement and test integration changes.
* **Security Team:** Reviews changes for security vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance Officer:** Reviews changes for compliance with relevant regulations.
* **Project Manager:** Oversees the change control process.


**6. Metrics and Reporting:**

* The change management team tracks key metrics, including:
    * Number of change requests submitted.
    * Average time to implement changes.
    * Number of rejected change requests.
    * Number of integration-related incidents.
    * PMBOK compliance adherence.

Regular reports are generated to monitor the effectiveness of the integration change control process and identify areas for improvement.


**7. Process Improvements:**

This process will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect best practices and address any identified shortcomings.  Feedback from stakeholders is encouraged to continually improve the efficiency and effectiveness of change management within ADPA.
