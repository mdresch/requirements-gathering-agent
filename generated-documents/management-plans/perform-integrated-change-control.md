# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

This document outlines the process for managing integration changes within the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This process ensures that changes are properly evaluated, approved, and implemented, minimizing disruption and maintaining the integrity of the system.

**1.0 Change Request Initiation:**

* **Source:** Changes can originate from various sources, including:
    * Project stakeholders (e.g., identification of gaps in functionality, new requirements).
    * Development team (e.g., bug fixes, performance improvements, technical debt reduction).
    * External factors (e.g., updates to API dependencies, changes in regulatory compliance).
* **Submission:** All change requests must be submitted using the designated change request form (Appendix A).  This form requires a clear description of the proposed change, its impact, and justification.  Priority levels (High, Medium, Low) should be assigned based on urgency and business impact.
* **Initial Assessment:** The Project Manager (PM) will acknowledge receipt of the change request and perform an initial assessment to determine its feasibility and potential impact.  This may involve consultation with relevant stakeholders and technical experts.

**2.0 Change Request Evaluation:**

* **Impact Analysis:** A detailed impact analysis will be conducted to assess the effects of the proposed change on:
    * Functionality: Will the change affect existing features?
    * Performance: Will the change improve or degrade system performance?
    * Security: Will the change introduce security vulnerabilities?
    * Compliance: Will the change affect compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, SOX)?
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**  The PM will evaluate the costs (development time, testing, deployment) and benefits (improved functionality, reduced risk) associated with the change.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Potential risks associated with the implementation of the change will be identified and assessed.  Mitigation strategies will be developed to address these risks.

**3.0 Change Request Approval:**

* **Review Board:** The Change Request Review Board (CRRB), consisting of the PM, lead developer, and key stakeholders, will review the change request and its associated documentation.
* **Approval Criteria:** The CRRB will approve the change request if it meets the following criteria:
    * The change is justified and aligns with project objectives.
    * The potential benefits outweigh the costs and risks.
    * The change can be implemented within the project constraints (time, budget, resources).
* **Rejection:** If the change request is rejected, the reasons for rejection will be communicated to the requestor.  The requestor may resubmit a revised change request.

**4.0 Change Implementation:**

* **Planning:** A detailed implementation plan will be created, outlining the tasks, timelines, and resources required.  This plan will include testing and deployment strategies.
* **Development:** The change will be implemented by the development team according to the implementation plan.  Version control (Git) will be used to track all changes.
* **Testing:** Rigorous testing will be conducted to ensure the change functions correctly and does not introduce new bugs or regressions.  This includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  Automated testing will be leveraged wherever possible.
* **Deployment:** The change will be deployed to the production environment according to the deployment plan.  This may involve a phased rollout to minimize disruption.

**5.0 Change Closure:**

* **Verification:** After deployment, the PM will verify that the change has been implemented successfully and meets the requirements.
* **Documentation Update:**  Project documentation will be updated to reflect the implemented change.
* **Lessons Learned:**  A lessons learned review will be conducted to identify any improvements to the change management process.

This process will be adapted and refined as needed based on project experience.  Regular reviews of this process will ensure its effectiveness in managing integration changes.
