# Cost Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2024

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the cost management plan for the ADPA project.  It details the methods and procedures used to plan, estimate, budget, and control project costs, ensuring the project stays within its allocated budget and delivers maximum value.  The plan adheres to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.


## 2. Cost Management Approach

A bottom-up estimating approach will be primarily used, leveraging detailed work package estimations from the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  This will be supplemented by analogous estimating based on similar projects and expert judgment where necessary.  Contingency reserves will be included to account for unforeseen costs and risks identified in the Risk Register.


## 3. Cost Estimation

### 3.1 Estimating Techniques

* **Bottom-up Estimating:**  Detailed cost estimation for each work package in the WBS, including resource allocation (labor, software licenses, cloud services, etc.).
* **Analogous Estimating:**  Comparison with similar past projects to estimate effort and costs for analogous tasks.
* **Expert Judgment:**  Input from experienced project team members and stakeholders for refining estimates based on their expertise.
* **Three-point Estimating:**  Using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely estimates for major work packages to account for uncertainty.


### 3.2 Cost Baseline

The cost baseline will be developed by aggregating the individual work package estimates, incorporating contingency reserves, and management reserves.  This baseline will serve as the primary benchmark against which actual project costs will be measured.  The baseline will be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses and new information becomes available.


### 3.3 Cost Elements

The project cost will encompass the following elements:

* **Labor Costs:**  Salaries and benefits for developers, testers, project managers, and other personnel involved in the project.  This will be based on the allocated resources and their hourly rates.
* **Software Costs:**  Costs associated with software licenses, tools, and development environments (e.g., TypeScript development tools, Azure DevOps, testing frameworks).
* **Cloud Services Costs:**  Expenses related to Azure OpenAI service usage, including API calls and storage. This will be monitored and managed using Azure's cost management tools.
* **Hardware Costs:**  If any new hardware is needed (unlikely given the cloud-based nature of the project), this cost will be documented.
* **Contingency Reserve:**  A percentage of the total estimated cost (to be determined based on risk analysis) to cover unforeseen expenses and risks.  This will be clearly identified and tracked separately.
* **Management Reserve:**  A reserve controlled by project management to address significant changes in scope or unforeseen circumstances.


## 4. Budget

The budget will be created based on the cost baseline.  It will be presented in a clear and concise format, including a detailed breakdown of costs by category.  Regular budget reviews will be conducted to monitor variances and take corrective actions as needed.  The budget will be documented in a separate budget document.


## 5. Cost Control

### 5.1 Earned Value Management (EVM)

Earned Value Management (EVM) will be used to monitor and control project costs throughout the project lifecycle.  Key EVM metrics (BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, SV, CV, SPI, CPI) will be regularly calculated and reported to track progress against the cost baseline.


### 5.2 Cost Variance Analysis

Regular cost variance analysis will identify any deviations from the planned budget.  These variances will be investigated to determine their causes and appropriate corrective actions will be implemented.


### 5.3 Change Control

A formal change control process will be followed for any changes to the project scope that might impact costs.  All change requests will be evaluated for their cost implications before approval.


## 6. Reporting

Regular cost reports will be generated and distributed to stakeholders.  These reports will include:

* **Cost Performance Baseline:** The planned cost baseline.
* **Earned Value Metrics:**  BCWS, BCWP, ACWP, SV, CV, SPI, CPI.
* **Cost Variances:**  Analysis of deviations from the planned budget.
* **Forecasted Costs:**  Predictions of future costs.
* **Contingency Reserve Usage:**  Tracking of contingency reserve utilization.
* **Management Reserve Usage:** Tracking of management reserve utilization.

Reports will be generated at least monthly, or more frequently if necessary, and distributed to the project sponsor and stakeholders.


## 7.  Tools and Techniques

The following tools and techniques will be used for cost management:

* **Microsoft Project (or similar):** For scheduling and cost tracking.
* **Spreadsheets (e.g., Excel):** For detailed cost breakdowns and analysis.
* **Azure Cost Management:** For monitoring and managing Azure OpenAI costs.
* **Earned Value Management (EVM) software (optional):** For advanced EVM calculations and reporting.

## 8.  Contingency and Management Reserves

A contingency reserve of 10% of the total estimated project cost will be established to address foreseeable risks. A management reserve of 5% will be set aside to handle unforeseen risks or changes in project scope.  These reserves will be managed according to the established change control process.

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints

* The cost estimates are based on current market rates and resource availability.
* The project schedule is assumed to be adhered to.
* The scope of the project is assumed to remain relatively stable.  Significant changes will require a formal change request.
* Access to Azure OpenAI and other necessary resources is assumed.


This Cost Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in scope, cost estimates, or risk assessments.
