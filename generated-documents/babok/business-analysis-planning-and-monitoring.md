This document outlines the Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring approach for the Advanced Document Processing & Automation (ADPA) framework project.  The purpose is to ensure effective coordination of business analysis activities, alignment with project goals, and timely delivery of high-quality deliverables.  This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle.

**Scope:** This plan covers all business analysis activities related to ADPA, including requirements elicitation, analysis, modeling, and communication.

**Key Stakeholders:**

* **Subject Matter Experts (SMEs):** [List Areas of Expertise]


## 2. Planning Approach

**Methodology:**  A combination of Agile and iterative approaches will be used, leveraging ADPA's capabilities for automated document generation where appropriate. This allows for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements.  The BABOK v3 guide will serve as the primary framework for guiding the business analysis activities.

**Deliverables:**

* **Business Analysis Plan:** This document.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  Linking requirements to design, development, and testing activities.
* **Stakeholder Register:**  Identifying and documenting key stakeholders and their interests.
* **Use Case Models:** Describing user interactions with the system.
* **Process Models:**  Illustrating key business processes supported by ADPA.
* **Data Models:** Defining data structures and relationships.
* **Requirements Specification Document:** A comprehensive document detailing all approved requirements.
* **Solution Evaluation Document (BABOK v3):**  Assessing implemented solutions against stakeholder needs and business value.
* **Regular Progress Reports:**  Tracking progress against the plan.
* **Lessons Learned Document:**  Capturing insights and improvements for future projects.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

## 3. Monitoring & Reporting

**Mechanisms for Tracking Progress:**

* **Project Management Software:** [Specify software, e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps] will be used to track tasks, bugs, and progress against the project schedule.
* **Regular Meetings:**  Weekly status meetings with key stakeholders will be held to discuss progress, identify roadblocks, and make decisions.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  The RTM will be used to track the status of each requirement throughout the lifecycle.
* **ADPA's Built-in Reporting:** Leverage ADPA's analytics and reporting features to monitor usage and identify areas for improvement.

**Reporting Structure:**

* **Weekly Status Reports:**  Summarizing progress against the plan, highlighting risks and issues.
* **Monthly Progress Reports:**  Providing a more detailed overview of progress, including key achievements and challenges.
* **Stakeholder Communication:** Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders through email, meetings, and other communication channels.


## 4. Review & Validation

**Stakeholder Review Process:**

All major deliverables (e.g., Requirements Specification Document) will be reviewed by relevant stakeholders before approval.  This will involve formal reviews and feedback sessions, documented using review comments and sign-off forms.

**Approval Workflow:**

A formal approval workflow will be established, ensuring that all deliverables are reviewed and approved by the appropriate stakeholders before proceeding to the next phase.  This workflow will be documented in a separate process document.
