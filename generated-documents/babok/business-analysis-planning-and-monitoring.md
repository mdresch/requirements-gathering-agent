# Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring for ADPA

**Project:** Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (ADPA)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (Business Analysis Expert)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for managing and monitoring the business analysis activities for the ADPA project.  The purpose is to ensure that business analysis work is aligned with project objectives, completed efficiently, and delivers the expected value.  This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle.

**Scope:** This plan covers all business analysis activities, including requirements elicitation, analysis, modeling, documentation, and stakeholder management.  It specifically addresses the BABOK v3 knowledge areas relevant to ADPA's development and implementation.

**Key Stakeholders:**

* **Project Sponsor:** [Name/Title]
* **Project Manager:** [Name/Title]
* **Business Analysts:** [Names/Titles]
* **Development Team:** [Lead Name/Title]
* **IT Operations:** [Lead Name/Title]
* **Key Stakeholders (End Users):** [List representative roles/departments]


## 2. Planning Approach

**Methodology:**  This project will utilize an iterative, Agile approach to business analysis, aligning with the overall project methodology.  We will leverage ADPA's own capabilities for generating BABOK compliant documentation where possible.

**Deliverables:**

* **Business Analysis Plan:** This document.
* **Stakeholder Register:**  A comprehensive list of stakeholders, their interests, and influence.  This will be maintained and updated throughout the project.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  Mapping requirements to design, development, and testing activities.  This will be dynamically updated using ADPA's capabilities.
* **Business Requirements Document (BRD):** A consolidated document outlining the high-level business needs and requirements for ADPA.
* **User Stories:**  Detailed descriptions of user interactions and expected system behavior.  This will be managed using ADPA's workflow features.
* **Process Models:**  Diagrams illustrating key business processes that ADPA will support or automate.
* **Data Models:**  Representations of the data ADPA will process and manage.
* **Solution Evaluation Plan:**  A detailed plan for evaluating the implemented solution against business objectives. This will leverage ADPA's BABOK v3 compliant reporting features.
* **Progress Reports:** Regular updates on the status of business analysis activities.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:** Overall project oversight, resource allocation, and risk management.
* **Business Analysts:** Requirements elicitation, analysis, modeling, documentation, and stakeholder management.  They will utilize ADPA for automation where feasible.
* **Development Team:**  Implementation of the ADPA system based on the approved requirements.
* **IT Operations:** Deployment and ongoing support of the ADPA system.


## 3. Monitoring & Reporting

**Mechanisms for Tracking Progress:**

* **Project Management Software:**  [Specify tool, e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps] will be used to track tasks, deadlines, and progress.
* **Requirements Management Tool:**  ADPA itself will be used to manage and track requirements throughout the lifecycle.
* **Regular Meetings:**  Weekly meetings with the project team to review progress and address any issues.
* **Progress Reports:**  Weekly/bi-weekly reports summarizing progress, risks, and issues.  These will leverage ADPA's reporting capabilities.

**Reporting Structure:**

* **Weekly Status Reports:**  To the Project Manager, highlighting progress against key milestones and any roadblocks.
* **Monthly Progress Reports:**  To the Project Sponsor, summarizing key achievements and upcoming activities.
* **Ad-hoc Reports:**  As needed to address specific stakeholder inquiries or concerns.


## 4. Review & Validation

**Stakeholder Review Process:**

* **Requirements Review:**  Formal reviews of the BRD, user stories, and other requirements artifacts with key stakeholders at various stages.
* **Solution Evaluation:**  Regular reviews of the implemented solution to ensure alignment with business needs. This will align with the Solution Evaluation Plan.

**Approval Workflow:**

* All major deliverables (BRD, RTM, etc.) will require formal approval from the Project Sponsor before proceeding to the next phase.
* A formal change management process will be implemented to handle any changes to the approved requirements.

This Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring document will be reviewed and updated at least monthly, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in project scope, priorities, or risks.  The ADPA framework itself will be a key tool in managing and tracking these changes, ensuring efficient and effective business analysis throughout the project lifecycle.
