# Requirements Analysis & Design Definition for ADPA

**Category:** BABOK v3

**Document ID:** ADPA-RAD-001

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Author:** AI-powered ADPA Framework


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Requirements Analysis & Design Definition for the Advanced Document Processing & Automation (ADPA) framework.  It details the approach to structuring, specifying, and validating requirements and designs to ensure the ADPA framework meets business needs and stakeholder expectations.  This document focuses specifically on the requirements related to the core functionalities,  excluding detailed specifications for integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services etc.), which are documented separately.


## 2. Business Need and Objectives

ADPA aims to provide a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis. The primary business objectives are:

* **Increased Efficiency:** Automate document creation and project management tasks, reducing manual effort and improving turnaround times.
* **Improved Compliance:** Ensure generated documents adhere to industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0).
* **Enhanced Quality:** Leverage AI to produce high-quality, consistent documentation.
* **Scalability and Maintainability:** Design a robust, scalable, and maintainable framework adaptable to future needs.
* **Reduced Costs:** Streamline processes and reduce reliance on manual labor.


## 3. Stakeholder Analysis

Key stakeholders include:

* **Business Analysts:**  Require tools to efficiently generate compliant documentation and manage requirements.
* **Project Managers:** Need support for project planning, tracking, and reporting, adhering to PMBOK guidelines.
* **Data Managers:**  Will utilize the DMBOK capabilities for data governance and management (future implementation).
* **IT Developers:** Responsible for framework development, maintenance, and integration.
* **End-Users:** Will interact with the CLI and/or API to generate documents.


## 4. Requirements Elicitation and Analysis

Requirements were elicited through a combination of methods, including:

* **Review of existing documentation:** Existing project specifications, industry standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
* **Stakeholder interviews:** Gathering feedback and requirements from key stakeholders.
* **Use case analysis:** Defining how stakeholders will interact with the system.
* **Prototyping and user feedback:** Iterative development and testing to refine requirements.

The following key functional and non-functional requirements were identified:

### 4.1 Functional Requirements:

* **Document Generation:** Generate various document types based on selected frameworks (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).  Support multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, PDF).
* **AI Integration:** Seamless integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) with automatic failover.
* **Framework Compliance:** Ensure generated documents comply with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and future DMBOK 2.0 standards.
* **CLI and API Interfaces:** Provide both command-line and REST API access for flexibility.
* **Template Management:** Allow users to create, manage, and update document templates.
* **User Authentication and Authorization:** Secure access control mechanisms (currently planned for Microsoft Entra ID integration).
* **Reporting and Analytics:** Track usage metrics and provide insights into system performance.

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements:

* **Performance:**  Fast and efficient document generation.
* **Scalability:**  Handle large volumes of requests and data.
* **Security:**  Protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Reliability:**  Ensure system stability and minimal downtime.
* **Maintainability:**  Easy to update, maintain, and extend.
* **Usability:**  Intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.


## 5. Solution Design

The ADPA framework utilizes a modular microservices architecture based on Node.js and TypeScript.  Key components include:

* **AI Processing Engine:** Orchestrates AI provider interactions.
* **Document Generator:**  Generates documents based on templates and AI input.
* **REST API Server:**  Provides a standardized interface for external applications.
* **CLI Interface:**  Allows for command-line interaction.
* **Data Storage:**  Stores configurations, templates, and generated documents (details to be specified in separate document).


## 6. Solution Evaluation

The ADPA framework will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* **Meeting functional and non-functional requirements.**
* **User acceptance testing (UAT).**
* **Performance benchmarks.**
* **Security audits.**
* **Compliance validation against BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK standards.**


## 7. Recommendations

Based on the requirements analysis and design, the following recommendations are made:

* Prioritize the implementation of Microsoft Entra ID integration for enhanced security.
* Continue iterative development and testing to ensure user satisfaction and system stability.
* Develop comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the framework.
* Establish a robust monitoring and logging system for performance tracking and troubleshooting.


## 8. Appendix

This section will include detailed specifications for data models, API endpoints, and other technical details.  These will be documented in separate, linked documents.
