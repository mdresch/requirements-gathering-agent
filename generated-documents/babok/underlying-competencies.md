# Underlying Competencies for Business Analysis (BABOK Guide v6 Compliant)

This document outlines the underlying competencies necessary for effective business analysis, aligning with the BABOK® Guide, Version 6.  These competencies are not isolated skills, but rather interwoven capabilities that enable business analysts to perform their roles effectively.  This document expands upon the high-level competencies presented in the BABOK Guide to provide a more detailed and actionable understanding.

**I.  Analytical Thinking & Problem Solving**

This competency encompasses the ability to critically examine information, identify patterns, draw conclusions, and develop creative solutions.

* **Critical Thinking:**  Objectively analyzing information, identifying biases, evaluating assumptions, and forming reasoned judgments.  This includes the ability to distinguish fact from opinion, identify fallacies in reasoning, and construct well-supported arguments.
* **Systems Thinking:** Understanding the interdependencies between different components of a system and how changes in one area can impact others. This includes the ability to model systems, identify feedback loops, and analyze system behavior.
* **Problem Decomposition:** Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts to facilitate analysis and solution development.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the underlying causes of problems, rather than just addressing symptoms. Techniques such as the "5 Whys" and fault tree analysis are relevant here.
* **Decision-Making:**  Using analytical skills and available information to make informed decisions, considering risks and trade-offs.  This includes understanding different decision-making frameworks and techniques.
* **Data Analysis:** Interpreting and drawing meaning from data, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. This involves understanding different data types, statistical methods, and data visualization techniques.
* **Modeling:** Creating visual representations of systems, processes, or data to facilitate understanding and communication.  This includes using various diagramming techniques (e.g., UML, BPMN).


**II.  Behavioral Characteristics**

These characteristics represent the ethical and professional conduct expected of a business analyst.

* **Professionalism:** Maintaining high ethical standards, exhibiting appropriate conduct, and demonstrating respect for others.
