# Elicitation & Collaboration

**Purpose:**  
This document outlines the approach, tasks, and techniques for requirements elicitation and stakeholder collaboration within the ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework project. It is aligned with BABOK v3 standards and tailored to the enterprise automation, integration, and compliance context of ADPA.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this Elicitation & Collaboration document is to define a structured approach for gathering, clarifying, and validating business, technical, and compliance requirements for ADPA. It ensures all stakeholder needs are captured and that the resulting requirements support the delivery of a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework.

### 1.2 Key Stakeholders
- **Project Sponsor:** Product Owner/Steering Committee  
- **Project Manager:** Sarah Johnson  
- **Business Analyst:** Mike Chen  
- **Technical Lead:** David Wilson  
- **QA Manager:** Lisa Brown  
- **Security and Compliance Officer** (for regulatory alignment)  
- **Enterprise Integration Leads:** SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe, API, and AI Provider SMEs  
- **End Users:** Enterprise project managers, analysts, and technical staff

## 2. Elicitation Preparation

### 2.1 Stakeholder and Source Identification
- Compile a comprehensive stakeholder register covering all functional areas (project management, document automation, data management, compliance, IT security).
- Identify external dependencies: AI providers (OpenAI, Google, GitHub Copilot, Ollama), integration partners (Atlassian, Microsoft), and compliance/legal advisors.

### 2.2 Elicitation Technique Selection
Based on project complexity and stakeholder landscape, the following techniques will be used:
- **Workshops:** Cross-functional sessions for requirements alignment and prioritization.
- **Interviews:** Targeted sessions with SMEs for technical, security, and compliance requirements.
- **Surveys/Questionnaires:** To gather input from distributed user groups.
- **Document Analysis:** Review of existing standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK), prior documentation, and regulatory materials.
- **Prototyping/Demo Sessions:** Showcasing CLI, API, and web interface features for early feedback.

### 2.3 Preparation Activities
- Develop workshop/interview agendas and question sets tailored to integration, security, AI, and compliance topics.
- Prepare supporting materials, including process diagrams, sample documents, and workflow maps.
- Set up logistics: schedule sessions, ensure remote access, and distribute materials in advance.

## 3. Conduct Elicitation

### 3.1 Execution of Elicitation Activities
- **Workshops:** Facilitate multi-stakeholder workshops focusing on key capabilities (document generation, workflow automation, compliance reporting, integration scenarios).
- **Interviews:** One-on-one or small group discussions to deep-dive on technical architecture, AI orchestration, and regulatory requirements.
- **Surveys:** Distribute and analyze targeted surveys for broader user input on usability and integration preferences.
- **Prototyping:** Live demonstrations of CLI, REST API, and admin interface; gather immediate feedback.

### 3.2 Documentation of Elicitation Results
- Record all workshop/interview outcomes, capturing decisions, requirements, pain points, and constraints.
- Document each elicited requirement with clear traceability to source and rationale.
- Use ADPA’s document generator to produce interim and final elicitation outputs in standardized formats.

---

## 4. Confirm Elicitation Results

### 4.1 Validation with Stakeholders
- Circulate documented requirements and elicitation summaries for stakeholder review and sign-off.
- Conduct follow-up sessions to clarify ambiguities, resolve conflicts, and ensure shared understanding.

### 4.2 Addressing Gaps and Ambiguities
- Perform gap analysis against BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK coverage to identify missing or ambiguous requirements.
- Update requirements artifacts based on stakeholder feedback and further analysis.

---

## 5. Collaboration & Communication

### 5.1 Ongoing Stakeholder Engagement
- Establish regular cadence for status updates, review meetings, and ad-hoc collaboration (e.g., bi-weekly standups, monthly steering reviews).
- Maintain open channels for stakeholder input via Confluence, SharePoint, and version control (GitHub Enterprise).

### 5.2 Communication Methods and Frequency
- **Email Updates:** Weekly summaries of progress and key decisions.
- **Confluence/SharePoint:** Centralized documentation repository; real-time updates and feedback.
- **Workshops/Meetings:** As per project plan (see Project Timeline).
- **Issue Tracker/Discussions:** GitHub Issues/Discussions for requirement clarifications and tracking.
