# Elicitation & Collaboration Plan: ADPA Framework

**Purpose:** This document outlines the strategy for eliciting requirements and fostering collaboration among stakeholders throughout the development and implementation of the Advanced Document Processing & Automation (ADPA) framework.

## 1. Introduction

**1.1 Project Overview:** The ADPA framework is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation solution for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.  It integrates with multiple AI providers and enterprise systems (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services).

**1.2 Scope:** This plan covers the elicitation and collaboration activities required to define the functional and non-functional requirements for ADPA, including its core features, integrations, and security aspects.

**1.3 Key Stakeholders:**

* **Product Owner (PO):** Menno Drescher (and any future POs)
* **Development Team:**  Software engineers responsible for ADPA development.
* **Business Analysts (BA):** Responsible for requirements gathering and analysis.
* **Enterprise Architects:**  Responsible for integration with existing enterprise systems.
* **Security Team:** Responsible for ensuring the security and compliance of the ADPA framework.
* **Beta Testers (Fortune 500 Companies):**  Provide feedback on usability and functionality.


## 2. Elicitation Preparation

**2.1 Stakeholder Analysis:**  A detailed stakeholder analysis has been conducted (see attached document:  `Stakeholder_Analysis.docx`). This analysis identifies key stakeholders, their interests, influence, and communication preferences.

**2.2 Requirements Elicitation Techniques:** The following techniques will be employed:

* **Interviews:**  Structured and semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (PO, Enterprise Architects, Security Team).
* **Surveys:**  Online surveys to gather feedback from a broader range of users.
* **Document Analysis:** Review of existing documentation (e.g., BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK) to identify relevant requirements.
* **Prototyping:**  Development of prototypes to gather feedback on usability and functionality.
* **Workshops:**  Facilitated workshops to collaboratively define requirements and resolve conflicts.
* **Observation:** Observing current document processing workflows to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.


**2.3 Elicitation Plan:**  A detailed schedule of elicitation activities will be created (see attached document: `Elicitation_Schedule.xlsx`). This schedule will include specific dates, times, participants, and locations for each activity.


## 3. Conduct Elicitation

**3.1 Interviews:** Interviews will be conducted using a structured approach, with pre-defined questions based on the stakeholder analysis.  Interview recordings and notes will be meticulously documented.

**3.2 Surveys:**  Surveys will be distributed using a reputable online survey platform (e.g., SurveyMonkey, Typeform). The survey will be designed to collect quantitative and qualitative data.

**3.3 Document Analysis:**  Review of existing standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK) will be conducted to ensure ADPA aligns with industry best practices.

**3.4 Prototyping:**  Prototypes will be developed iteratively, with feedback incorporated at each stage.  This will involve close collaboration with the development team and beta testers.

**3.5 Workshops:**  Workshops will be held to facilitate collaborative requirements definition and conflict resolution.  Minutes from each workshop will be documented and distributed to participants.

**3.6 Observation:**  Observation of current document processing workflows will be conducted to understand existing processes and identify areas for improvement.


## 4. Confirm Elicitation Results

**4.1 Requirements Validation:**  The elicited requirements will be validated with stakeholders through reviews and walkthroughs.  This will ensure that the requirements are accurate, complete, and consistent.

**4.2 Requirements Traceability:**  A traceability matrix will be created to link requirements to design, implementation, and testing activities.  This will ensure that all requirements are addressed throughout the development lifecycle.

**4.3 Requirements Prioritization:**  Requirements will be prioritized based on business value, risk, and feasibility.  This will help to focus development efforts on the most important features.


## 5. Collaboration & Communication

**5.1 Communication Plan:**  A communication plan will be developed to ensure effective communication among stakeholders.  This plan will outline communication methods (email, meetings, project management tools), frequency, and responsible parties.

**5.2 Collaboration Tools:**  Collaboration tools such as Jira, Confluence, or Microsoft Teams will be used to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing.

**5.3 Regular Meetings:**  Regular meetings will be held with stakeholders to review progress, address issues, and make decisions.  Meeting minutes will be documented and distributed.

**5.4 Feedback Mechanisms:**  Mechanisms for providing feedback will be established, including regular feedback sessions with beta testers.


## 6. Revision History
