**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Project Manager:** [TO BE ASSIGNED]
**Executive Sponsor:** [EXECUTIVE SPONSOR NAME]
**PMO Director:** [PMO DIRECTOR NAME]


## 1. Executive Summary

This Project Charter authorizes the initiation of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  This strategic initiative directly addresses the persistent challenge of inefficient and inconsistent project documentation across the organization.  ADPA offers a transformative solution by leveraging AI to automate the generation of PMBOK 7.0-compliant project documentation, resulting in significant time savings, improved accuracy, enhanced stakeholder alignment, and reduced compliance risks.  The project’s success is critical to improving project delivery predictability and organizational efficiency, directly supporting [mention specific corporate strategic objective, e.g., the company's initiative to accelerate digital transformation]. The robust business case, detailed in [link to Business Case document], projects a strong ROI based on [mention key ROI drivers, e.g., reduced administrative overhead, improved project success rates].  This charter grants the Project Manager full authority to execute the project within the defined scope and budget.


## 2. Project Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives:**

* **Automate PMBOK 7.0 compliant documentation generation:** Reduce manual effort in creating project documentation by at least 75%, as measured by time tracking data compared to pre-ADPA processes.
* **Improve documentation consistency and accuracy:** Achieve a 95% consistency score across all generated documents, as measured by automated PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation, and a reduction in identified errors by at least 80%, based on historical error rates.
* **Enhance stakeholder alignment:** Achieve a 90% stakeholder satisfaction rating on the clarity and usefulness of project documentation, as measured by post-project stakeholder surveys.
* **Increase Project Delivery Efficiency:** Shorten project initiation time by 50% and improve project completion rates by 15%, based on historical data.


**Success Criteria:**

* Successful deployment of ADPA and integration into existing workflows.
* Achievement of primary objectives listed above.
* Positive ROI as projected in the business case.
* Successful completion of all major deliverables outlined in the Scope Statement [link to Scope Statement document].


**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

* Percentage of project documentation tasks automated.
* Documentation consistency score (PMBOK 7.0 compliance).
* Stakeholder satisfaction rating (survey results).
* Reduction in project initiation time.
* Improvement in project completion rates.
* Actual vs. projected ROI.


## 3. Project Scope and Deliverables

**High-Level Scope:**  The ADPA project encompasses the development, testing, deployment, and integration of an AI-powered tool that automatically generates a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents. This includes, but is not limited to, project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and other planning artifacts. ADPA will also include a robust technical design documentation generation system, and a business communication translator system.  The tool will be delivered as a command-line interface (CLI) application for ease of use and integration into existing workflows.

**Major Deliverables:**

* Fully functional ADPA CLI application with integrated AI capabilities.
* Comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant document templates.
* Automated testing and validation framework for generated documents.
* User documentation and training materials.
* Integrated version control system for generated documents.
* Successful integration of ADPA into at least three pilot projects.


**Scope Boundaries:**

**In Scope:** Development, testing, and deployment of the ADPA CLI application, including all features outlined in the Scope Statement.  Integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama AI platforms.

**Out of Scope:** Integration with third-party project management software beyond initial pilot projects.  Development of customized document templates beyond the standard PMBOK suite.  Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial post-deployment period.
