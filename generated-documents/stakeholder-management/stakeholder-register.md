## Document Purpose

This Stakeholder Register identifies and documents detailed information about project stakeholders, their requirements, expectations, and influence levels. This document serves as the foundation for stakeholder engagement planning and communication strategy.  It leverages information synthesized from the project README,  and anticipates the need for organizational input to complete certain sections.

## 1. Stakeholder Identification Summary

**Primary Stakeholders (High Power, High Interest):**  Based on the project's README, the primary stakeholders are likely:

* **Project Managers:** Individuals directly using ADPA to generate project documentation.  Their high interest stems from the tool's direct impact on their workflow efficiency and PMBOK compliance. Their power is derived from their project leadership roles.
* **Business Analysts:** Similar to Project Managers, Business Analysts benefit directly from ADPA's capabilities for requirements gathering and documentation. Their high interest and power are aligned with their roles in defining project needs and specifications.
* **Software Developers:**  While not explicitly mentioned as users in the README, developers are implicit stakeholders due to ADPA's reliance on AI technology and potential future integrations.  Their interest is moderate to high, depending on involvement in integrations. Their power is moderate, based on their technical expertise and contribution to the project's success.


**Secondary Stakeholders (Variable Power/Interest):**  These stakeholders are inferred based on the project's scope and functionality:

* **Executive Management:**  High power, potentially low initial interest, unless specific executive sponsorship is assigned.  Their approval and support are crucial for resource allocation and project success.
* **IT Department:** Moderate power and interest. Responsible for infrastructure, security, and potential integrations with existing systems.
* **Legal/Compliance Department:** Low to moderate power and interest, dependent on data handling and regulatory aspects.
* **Marketing/Sales:** Low to moderate power and interest, depending on the strategy for promoting ADPA.
