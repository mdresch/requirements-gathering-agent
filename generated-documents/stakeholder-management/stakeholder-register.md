## 1. Stakeholder Identification Summary

**Primary Stakeholders (High Power, High Interest)**  These stakeholders have significant influence over the project and a high level of interest in its success.  They are typically the direct users and project sponsors.  Based on the provided README, primary stakeholders include:

* **Project Managers:**  Individuals directly using ADPA to generate PMBOK documentation.  They require a user-friendly tool, accurate document generation, and PMBOK compliance.
* **Business Analysts:** Individuals using ADPA to translate technical context into business-ready documents. They need a tool that accurately reflects project essence in strategic communications.
* **Software Developers (Internal):** The team responsible for developing and maintaining ADPA. They need access to project documentation, clear requirements, and tools for testing and deployment.

**Secondary Stakeholders (Variable Power/Interest)** These stakeholders may have varying levels of power and interest in the project.  Their involvement may be indirect but still crucial for success.  Based on the README and inferred organizational structure, secondary stakeholders include:

* **Executive Leadership:** (CEO, CTO, VP of Engineering)  Interested in the strategic impact of ADPA, ROI, and alignment with company goals.  Power level is high, interest level is medium to high, depending on the individual and their familiarity with the project.
* **Marketing/Sales:** Interested in ADPA's market positioning and contribution to sales. Power level is medium, interest level is high.
* **Customer Support:** May receive questions about ADPA usage. Power level is low, interest level is medium.
* **Azure Cloud Team (Microsoft):**  Their involvement is indirect, but crucial for ensuring the ongoing stability and access to Azure OpenAI services. Power level is high (in terms of technical impact), interest level is low (unless there are specific integration issues).
* **OpenAI/Google AI/GitHub AI Teams (External):** These teams are indirectly involved as ADPA utilizes their AI models. Their power level is high (in terms of model availability and performance), and their interest level is low unless there are issues with the models.
* **NPM Community:** The users downloading and utilizing ADPA from the NPM registry.  Their power level is low individually, but their collective impact (through feedback, reviews, and downloads) is high. Their interest level is high.
