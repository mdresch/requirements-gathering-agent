## 1. Stakeholder Identification Summary

**Primary Stakeholders (High Power, High Interest)**

These stakeholders have a direct interest in the success of the project and significant influence on its direction.  Based on the provided documents, the primary stakeholders are:

* **Development Team:**  High power due to their direct involvement in building the system. High interest in creating a high-quality, maintainable product.
* **Product Owner:** High power due to their responsibility for defining the product vision and requirements. High interest in ensuring the product meets user needs and business goals.
* **Architecture Team:** High power in influencing the technical design and implementation. High interest in ensuring scalability, maintainability, and integration with existing systems.
* **Testing Team:** High interest in thorough testing and quality assurance.  Power level is moderate as they influence the process but don't directly define requirements.


**Secondary Stakeholders (Variable Power/Interest)**

These stakeholders have some level of interest or influence on the project, but their involvement is less direct than primary stakeholders. Based on inferred needs from the documents:

* **Executive Management:** High power, but interest level depends on the project's strategic importance.  Requires engagement to secure buy-in and resources.
* **Legal/Compliance:** Moderate power and interest if the system handles sensitive data or needs to comply with specific regulations.
* **IT Operations:** Moderate power and interest, responsible for deploying and maintaining the system.
* **End Users (other teams):** Low power but high interest in using the tool effectively.  Their feedback is crucial.
