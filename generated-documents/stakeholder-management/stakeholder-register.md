## 1. Stakeholder Identification Summary

### Primary Stakeholders (High Power, High Interest)

This category includes individuals directly involved in the project's success and who have significant decision-making power.  Based on the project README, these are likely:

* **Project Manager:**  (Internal, High Power, High Interest)  Responsible for overall project execution and success.  Requires regular updates and key decision-making input.
* **Lead Developer:** (Internal, High Power, Medium Interest)  Responsible for technical implementation and architecture. Requires technical specifications and progress updates.
