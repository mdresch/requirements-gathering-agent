## 4. Stakeholder Engagement Plan (Summary)

A detailed Stakeholder Engagement Plan will be developed separately, outlining specific communication strategies, meeting schedules, and feedback mechanisms for each stakeholder group.  This plan will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect changing project needs and stakeholder expectations.


## 5.  Communication Matrix

A comprehensive communication matrix will be created outlining specific communication methods, frequency, and responsible parties for each stakeholder.  This will ensure timely and relevant communication throughout the project.
