## Stakeholder Assessment

**Power/Interest Grid:**

This grid categorizes stakeholders based on their power (influence) and interest in the project.

| Power/Interest Quadrant | Stakeholders                                      | Engagement Strategy                                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Power/High Interest** | Menno Drescher, Engineering Team, Product Team     | Manage Closely: Frequent communication, collaboration, active involvement in decision-making. |
| **High Power/Low Interest** | Legal Team                                         | Keep Satisfied: Regular updates, address concerns promptly, ensure compliance.                   |
| **Low Power/High Interest** | NPM Users                                          | Keep Informed: Regular updates, feedback mechanisms, community building.                        |
| **Low Power/Low Interest** |  External AI Providers (unless actively engaged)   | Monitor: Occasional check-ins, maintain awareness.                                     |


**Stakeholder Attitudes:**

Currently, most internal stakeholders exhibit a positive attitude towards ADPA, driven by its successful inception and recent milestones.  NPM users represent a largely untapped but potentially significant group of supporters. External AI providers may be neutral or even slightly resistant depending on their competitive landscape and potential for integration with ADPA.

## Monitoring and Control

Regular stakeholder meetings (weekly or bi-weekly) will track progress, address concerns, and ensure alignment.  A dedicated communication channel (e.g., Slack channel, project management tool) will facilitate ongoing communication and issue resolution.

2. **Feedback Mechanisms:**  Establish clear channels for collecting feedback from users and incorporating it into future development.
3. **Continuous Improvement:**  Regularly review and update the stakeholder analysis and engagement strategies based on feedback and changing project needs.
4. **Transparency:**  Maintain transparency about project progress, challenges, and decisions.


This stakeholder analysis provides a framework for effective engagement.  Regular review and adaptation will be crucial to ensure continued alignment and project success.
