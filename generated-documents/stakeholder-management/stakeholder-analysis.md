# Stakeholder Analysis: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## Executive Summary

This stakeholder analysis identifies key individuals and groups impacted by the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, assesses their influence and interest, and proposes engagement strategies to ensure project success.  Key stakeholders include the development team, project management office (PMO), executive sponsors, end-users (project managers and business analysts), and potentially external parties such as AI service providers (Azure, Google, etc.).  The analysis highlights the need for proactive communication, addressing potential resistance from those accustomed to manual processes, and leveraging early successes to build momentum and support.
