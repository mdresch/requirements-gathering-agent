# Stakeholder Analysis: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## Executive Summary

This stakeholder analysis identifies key individuals and groups impacted by the ADPA project, assesses their influence and interest, and proposes tailored engagement strategies to ensure project success.  The analysis reveals a diverse stakeholder landscape requiring a multi-faceted approach, prioritizing close management of high-influence, high-interest stakeholders (primarily the development team and product owner) while maintaining satisfaction among executive leadership and keeping informed those with high interest but limited influence (e.g., early adopters).  Effective communication, proactive risk mitigation, and regular feedback loops are crucial for successful stakeholder management.
