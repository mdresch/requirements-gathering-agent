# Stakeholder Analysis: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

## Executive Summary

This stakeholder analysis identifies key individuals and groups impacted by the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, assesses their influence and interest, and proposes tailored engagement strategies to ensure project success.  The analysis reveals a need for proactive communication with the development team and product owner (high influence, high interest), consistent updates for the architecture and testing teams (high influence, moderate interest), and transparent information sharing for other stakeholders.  Addressing potential resistance from stakeholders concerned about the project's impact on existing processes is crucial.

### External Stakeholders (Potentially impacted, requires further investigation)

* **Banking Clients:**  Indirectly impacted by the improved API.  Interest and influence are currently low but could increase significantly with successful implementation and adoption.
* **Regulatory Bodies:**  Interest is high due to compliance requirements. Influence is high due to potential regulatory actions.
* **Third-Party Vendors:**  If the RGA integrates with third-party tools, these vendors would be stakeholders.  Interest and influence vary depending on the vendor.
