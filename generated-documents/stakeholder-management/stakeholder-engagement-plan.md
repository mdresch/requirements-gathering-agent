**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2025

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the stakeholder engagement plan for the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project.  Given ADPA's unique capabilities – including self-authorization and the generation of its own strategic documents – a robust and multifaceted stakeholder engagement strategy is crucial for successful adoption and ongoing support.  This plan details how we will identify, analyze, plan, execute, monitor, and manage engagement with all stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.


## 2. Stakeholder Identification and Analysis

ADPA's stakeholder ecosystem is complex, extending beyond typical software projects due to its AI-driven strategic capabilities. The following categories represent key stakeholder groups:

**2.1 Internal Stakeholders:**

* **Development Team:** Responsible for ADPA's development, maintenance, and improvement.  High engagement required throughout the lifecycle.
* **Product Management:** Defining the product vision, roadmap, and prioritizing features.  High engagement, particularly during planning and release phases.
* **Marketing & Sales:** Promoting ADPA and managing customer relationships. High engagement during launch and ongoing marketing campaigns.

* **IT Infrastructure Team:** Ensuring adequate infrastructure for ADPA's operation.  Engagement required during deployment and ongoing maintenance.
* **Legal & Compliance:** Ensuring ADPA's compliance with relevant regulations and policies.  Engagement during development and before release.


**2.2 External Stakeholders:**

* **Current Users:** Individuals and organizations currently using the Requirements Gathering Agent (predecessor to ADPA).  High engagement needed to manage the transition and gather feedback.
* **Potential Users:** Project managers, business analysts, and other professionals who could benefit from ADPA's capabilities.  Targeted marketing and outreach are crucial.
* **AI Provider Representatives (Azure, Google, GitHub, Ollama):**  Maintaining relationships with AI providers for technical support and potential future integrations.  Engagement needed for technical queries and troubleshooting.
* **Open Source Community:**  Managing contributions and feedback from the open-source community.  Engagement vital for sustaining community involvement.
