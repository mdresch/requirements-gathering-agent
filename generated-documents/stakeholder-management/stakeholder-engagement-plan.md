**Project:** Self-Charging Electric Vehicles (SCEV)

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the stakeholder engagement plan for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project.  The plan details the strategies and methods for effectively communicating with and managing expectations of all stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.  The success of this ambitious project hinges on securing buy-in and collaboration from a diverse range of stakeholders.


**2. Project Goals & Objectives**

This project aims to develop a self-charging electric vehicle that significantly reduces reliance on traditional charging infrastructure by harvesting ambient energy.  Key objectives include:
