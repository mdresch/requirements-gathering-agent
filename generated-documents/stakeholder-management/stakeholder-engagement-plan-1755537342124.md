## 3. Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

This section outlines the communication requirements for the current project phase (Initiation & Planning).

### 3.1 Scope and Impact of Change

The ADPA project introduces significant changes: a new AI-powered framework replacing existing manual processes. This impacts all stakeholders, particularly end users who will adopt the new system and business analysts responsible for requirements. Sponsors will experience changes in reporting and decision-making.  The PMO will need to oversee a new technology implementation.

### 3.2 Interrelationships and Overlaps

The Project Sponsor provides overall direction and authorization. The PMO provides oversight and guidance.  The project team executes the development.  Business analysts define requirements. IT ensures infrastructure compatibility. End-users provide feedback on usability. External partners provide AI capabilities. Regulatory bodies ensure compliance.

Significant overlap exists between the business analysts and the project team concerning requirements. The IT department and the project team overlap in integration.

* **Monthly:** Formal review with the PMO and key stakeholders to assess progress and identify any necessary changes to the engagement strategy.
* **End of Each Phase:** Comprehensive review to plan for the next phase, based on lessons learned and feedback.


## 5. Issue Resolution

Any issues related to stakeholder engagement will be documented, escalated appropriately, and addressed promptly.  A formal issue log will be maintained.


This Stakeholder Engagement Plan serves as a living document and will be adapted as the project progresses and new information becomes available.  Effective stakeholder management is crucial for the success of the ADPA project.
