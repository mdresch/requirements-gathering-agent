## Test Case Specifications: Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the test cases for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) application.  The tests are categorized for clarity and traceability.

**1. Test Case Structure:**

| Test Case ID | Test Case Name | Category | Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Results | Pass/Fail Criteria | Test Data Requirements | Test Environment | Test Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|


**2. Test Case Categories:**

* **Installation & Basic Usage:** Verify successful installation and basic functionality across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and Node.js versions.
* **PMBOK Document Generation:** Test the generation of all 29 PMBOK documents, verifying completeness, accuracy, and adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Enhanced Project Analysis:** Validate the intelligent source discovery, relevance scoring, and automatic categorization of project files.
* **Context Manager:** Test the three-phase context strategy, ensuring optimal context utilization for different AI models (Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, Ollama).
* **AI Provider Integration:** Verify seamless integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama, handling authentication and API calls correctly.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Test all CLI options and flags, ensuring correct functionality and error handling.
* **Validation & Quality Assurance:** Verify PMBOK compliance validation, quality assessment scoring, and cross-document consistency checks.
* **Version Control System (VCS):** Test the built-in VCS features, including commit history, diffs, revert, push, and pull functionalities.
* **Error Handling & Robustness:** Test various error conditions (network issues, API errors, invalid input) and verify appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms.
* **Modular Processor Architecture:** Verify the addition, update, and removal of document processors using the modular architecture.
* **Configuration:** Test the loading and usage of configurations from `.env` files for different AI providers.
* **Output Formats:** Verify correct generation of output in markdown, JSON, and YAML formats.


**3. Test Data Requirements:**

* **Sample Projects:**  A set of sample projects with varying complexities and documentation structures (small, medium, large projects with different file structures and content) will be used.  These will include README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, and other relevant files.
* **Configuration Files:** Different `.env` files with valid and invalid configurations for each AI provider will be used.
* **Invalid Input:** A range of invalid inputs for CLI commands and configuration parameters will be used to test error handling.
* **Existing Documents:**  Existing PMBOK documents will be used for validation tests.


**4.  Specific Test Cases (Examples):**

**Category: Installation & Basic Usage**

| Test Case ID | Test Case Name | Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Results | Pass/Fail Criteria | Test Data Requirements | Test Environment | Test Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC_INSTALL_001 | Successful Global Installation | Verify successful installation using `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent` | Node.js 18+ installed | 1. Execute installation command. 2. Verify installation in global directory. | Installation completes successfully without errors. RGA command is accessible globally. | Installation completes successfully, command is accessible. | Node.js 18+ | Windows, macOS, Linux | None |
| TC_INSTALL_002 | Successful Local Installation (npx) | Verify successful installation using `npx requirements-gathering-agent` | Node.js 18+ installed | 1. Execute installation command. 2. Verify execution without errors. | Execution completes successfully without errors. | Execution completes successfully. | Node.js 18+ | Windows, macOS, Linux | None |


**Category: PMBOK Document Generation**

| Test Case ID | Test Case Name | Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Results | Pass/Fail Criteria | Test Data Requirements | Test Environment | Test Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC_PMBOK_001 | Generate All Documents | Verify generation of all 29 PMBOK documents. | RGA installed, valid AI provider configured | 1. Execute `requirements-gathering-agent`. 2. Verify the existence of all 29 documents in the output directory. | All 29 documents are generated without errors.  | All 29 documents are present and correctly formatted. | Sample project with README.md | Node.js environment, valid API keys |  Valid API keys for selected AI provider |


**Category: Enhanced Project Analysis**

| Test Case ID | Test Case Name | Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Results | Pass/Fail Criteria | Test Data Requirements | Test Environment | Test Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC_ANALYSIS_001 | Discover Relevant Files | Verify that RGA correctly discovers and analyzes all relevant files in a project directory. | RGA installed and configured | 1. Run RGA with a sample project. 2. Observe the analysis output. | RGA identifies all relevant files, categorizes them correctly, and assigns relevance scores. | All relevant files are identified, categorized correctly, and scored appropriately.  | Sample project with diverse file types and structures | Node.js environment | None |


**(Continue this pattern for all categories and specific test cases.)**


**5. Preconditions:**

* RGA is successfully installed and configured.
* Necessary environment variables (API keys, endpoints) are set correctly.
* Test data (sample projects, configuration files) is prepared.
* Network connectivity is available.


**6. Test Steps:**  Detailed steps for each test case will be documented separately.


**7. Expected Results:**  Specific expected outcomes for each test case will be detailed.


**8. Pass/Fail Criteria:** Clear criteria to determine if a test case passed or failed.


**9. Test Environment:** The operating system, Node.js version, and other relevant software details will be specified for each test case.


**10. Test Dependencies:**  Any dependencies between test cases will be noted.


**11. Traceability Matrix:** A traceability matrix will link requirements to test cases, ensuring complete test coverage.  (This will be a separate document.)


This detailed framework ensures comprehensive testing of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Individual test cases will be fleshed out with more detailed steps, expected results, and test data.  The traceability matrix will provide a clear link between requirements and test cases.
