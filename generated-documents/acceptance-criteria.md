# Acceptance Criteria: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Acceptance will be determined by successful completion of all criteria listed below, categorized by feature area.  Testing will be performed using a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and manual verification against expected outputs.


**I. Core Functionality: PMBOK Document Generation**

* **AC1.1 - Comprehensive Document Suite:** The system shall generate all 29 PMBOK-defined documents (as listed in the project README) from a provided README.md file and supporting project documentation.  Each document shall adhere to the specified PMBOK 7.0 standard.
* **AC1.2 - Accurate Content:** The generated documents shall accurately reflect the information contained within the input README.md and discovered supporting project documentation.  Manual review will be conducted to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* **AC1.3 - PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:** All generated documents shall be validated against PMBOK 7.0 standards.  A compliance report shall be generated, identifying any discrepancies.  A compliance score of 95% or higher is required for acceptance.
* **AC1.4 - Consistent Terminology:**  The system shall maintain consistent terminology across all generated documents.  A consistency check will be performed to identify and resolve any inconsistencies.
* **AC1.5 -  Organized Output:** Generated documents shall be organized into a clear, well-structured directory as specified in the project README.
* **AC1.6 -  Markdown Output:** The default output format shall be Markdown (.md).  The system should also support JSON and YAML output formats as specified in the CLI options.


**II. Enhanced Project Analysis**

* **AC2.1 - Source Discovery:** The system shall automatically discover and analyze relevant project documentation files (including README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, etc.) from specified directories.
* **AC2.2 - Relevance Scoring:** Each discovered file shall be assigned a relevance score (0-100) based on content, location, and naming patterns, reflecting its importance to the document generation process.
* **AC2.3 - Context Building:** The system shall utilize the discovered and scored files to build a comprehensive project context for the AI model, prioritizing high-scoring, relevant sources.
* **AC2.4 - Context Reporting:** The system shall provide a report detailing the discovered files, their relevance scores, and the context utilized for document generation.


**III. Enhanced Context Manager**

* **AC3.1 -  Context Utilization:** The system shall utilize at least 50% of the available context window for large language models (like GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro) and at least 20% for smaller models, maximizing the accuracy of generated documents.  A context utilization report shall be generated.
* **AC3.2 - Adaptive Context Strategy:** The system shall adapt its context strategy based on the capabilities of the chosen AI model, as outlined in the project README.
* **AC3.3 -  Model-Specific Optimization:** The system shall automatically detect and optimize for different AI models (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), employing the appropriate context strategy.
* **AC3.4 - Reporting and Analytics:** The system shall provide detailed reporting and analytics on context performance, including token usage, model type, and utilization percentage.


**IV.  Technical Design Document System**

* **AC4.1 -  Ten Specialized Processors:** The system shall include ten functional processors for generating the specified technical design documents (as listed in the project README).
* **AC4.2 -  Professional Templates:** Each processor shall utilize professional, comprehensive markdown templates for enterprise-grade documentation.
* **AC4.3 -  CLI Integration:**  All technical design documents shall be accessible via individual CLI commands (`--generate <documenttype>`).
* **AC4.4 -  Context-Aware Generation:** The generated technical documents shall leverage the project context for personalized and relevant content.


**V. Business Communication Translator System**

* **AC5.1 -  Strategic Document Generation:** The system shall successfully generate professional Company Values and Purpose Statements, reflecting the project's mission and capabilities.
* **AC5.2 -  Authenticity and Intelligence:** The generated strategic documents shall accurately reflect the project's essence and include appropriate expansions on technical details.
* **AC5.3 -  Professional Quality Output:** The generated documents shall be of professional quality, suitable for executive presentations and corporate websites.


**VI.  Version Control System (VCS)**

* **AC6.1 - Automatic Versioning:** The system shall automatically commit changes to a local git repository after each document generation.
* **AC6.2 - CLI VCS Commands:** The system shall provide CLI commands (`vcs log`, `vcs diff`, `vcs revert`, `vcs status`, `vcs push`, `vcs pull`) for managing the generated documents' version control.
* **AC6.3 -  Remote Sync (Optional):** The system shall allow optional configuration of a remote git repository for collaboration and backup.


**VII.  Error Handling and Robustness**

* **AC7.1 -  Retry Logic:** The system shall include retry logic for handling failed API calls or other errors during document generation.
* **AC7.2 -  Comprehensive Error Reporting:** The system shall provide detailed error messages and logs to aid in troubleshooting.
* **AC7.3 -  Graceful Degradation:**  The system shall handle unexpected inputs or errors gracefully, preventing crashes or data loss.


**VIII.  User Interface and Experience (CLI)**

* **AC8.1 -  Clear and Concise Help:** The CLI shall provide clear and concise help messages (`-h`, `--help`) explaining all available options and commands.
* **AC8.2 -  Intuitive Commands:** The CLI commands shall be intuitive and easy to use.
* **AC8.3 -  User Feedback:** The CLI shall provide informative feedback to the user during the document generation process.


**IX.  Modular Architecture**

* **AC9.1 - Extensibility:** The modular architecture shall allow for easy addition of new document types and AI providers without significant code changes.  This will be demonstrated by adding a new simple document type during testing.


These acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating the success of the ADPA project.  Any deviation from these criteria will require investigation and resolution before project acceptance.
