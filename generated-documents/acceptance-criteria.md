# Acceptance Criteria: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, ensuring that the final product meets the defined requirements and expectations.  Acceptance will be determined by successful completion of all criteria listed below, categorized by feature set.


**I. Core Functionality: PMBOK Document Generation**

* **AC1.1 Comprehensive Document Set:**  The system shall generate all 29 PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents (as listed in the README) from a provided project README.md file and any supplementary project documentation discovered via the enhanced project analysis.  Each document shall be structurally and semantically correct according to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.
* **AC1.2 Accurate Content:** The generated documents shall accurately reflect the information contained within the input README.md file and supplementary documentation, with minimal factual errors or omissions.  Any assumptions made by the AI shall be clearly stated within the document.
* **AC1.3  Consistent Terminology:**  The system shall maintain consistent terminology across all generated documents.  Project-specific terms should be consistently used throughout.
* **AC1.4  Proper Formatting:** All generated documents shall adhere to a professional and consistent markdown formatting style, including clear headings, sections, and bullet points.
* **AC1.5  Organized Output:** The generated documents shall be organized into a clear and logical directory structure (as defined in the README).
* **AC1.6  Error Handling:** The system shall gracefully handle invalid input data or unexpected errors during document generation, providing informative error messages to the user.  Incomplete documents should not be generated.  A retry mechanism should be available and function correctly.
* **AC1.7  JSON Output (Optional):** The system shall provide an option to output all documents in a validated JSON format, ensuring interoperability with other systems.


**II. Enhanced Project Analysis**

* **AC2.1  Comprehensive Source Discovery:** The system shall automatically identify and process all relevant markdown files within a specified project directory, including those located in subdirectories (up to three levels deep), correctly categorizing them based on content and location.
* **AC2.2  Accurate Relevance Scoring:** The relevance scoring system (0-100) shall accurately reflect the relevance of each discovered file to PMBOK documentation generation.  The scoring methodology should be documented and auditable.
* **AC2.3  Intelligent Context Building:** The system shall prioritize and integrate information from multiple sources to build a comprehensive project context for AI processing, balancing context size to avoid token overflow while maximizing information.  The system should provide feedback on the context used.
* **AC2.4  Source File Suggestions:** The system shall suggest the most valuable source files for manual review, based on relevance scores and content analysis.


**III. Enhanced Context Manager**

* **AC3.1  Adaptive Context Strategy:** The Enhanced Context Manager shall automatically adapt its context strategy (Core, Ultra-Large, Large Supplementary) to the capabilities of the chosen AI model, maximizing context utilization.
* **AC3.2  Large Model Support:** The system shall support ultra-large context models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) with up to 90% context utilization.
* **AC3.3  Context Reporting:** The system shall provide detailed reports on context utilization, including token counts and performance metrics.


**IV.  Technical Design Document System**

* **AC4.1  Complete Document Set:** The system shall generate all 10 technical design documents (as listed in the README) using specialized AI prompts and professional templates.
* **AC4.2  Context-Aware Generation:** The generated technical documents shall incorporate relevant project context from the project analysis for personalized and relevant content.
* **AC4.3  CLI Integration:**  Individual technical document generation commands should function correctly, as detailed in the README examples.
* **AC4.4  Professional Templates:** The templates used for technical documents should meet professional standards for clarity, completeness, and consistency.


**V. Business Communication Translator System**

* **AC5.1  Strategic Document Generation:** The system shall successfully generate professional Company Values, Purpose Statements, and other executive-ready strategic documents.
* **AC5.2  Authenticity and Relevance:** The generated strategic documents shall accurately reflect the project's mission, capabilities, and context.
* **AC5.3  Professional Quality:** The output of the system should be of a quality suitable for executive presentations and corporate websites.


**VI.  Version Control System**

* **AC6.1  Automatic Versioning:**  Every document generation or update shall be automatically committed to a local Git repository.
* **AC6.2  CLI Access:**  All Git commands listed in the README shall function correctly.
* **AC6.3  Remote Sync (Optional):** If configured, the system shall successfully push and pull changes from a remote Git repository.


**VII.  PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation**

* **AC7.1  Compliance Checking:** The system shall validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, identifying missing elements or inconsistencies.
* **AC7.2  Quality Assessment:** The system shall provide detailed quality scores (0-100) for each document, with actionable recommendations for improvement.
* **AC7.3  Consistency Validation:** The system shall verify consistency in terminology and information across all generated documents.


**VIII.  Multiple AI Provider Support**

* **AC8.1  Provider Selection:** The system shall allow the user to select an AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) through a clear and intuitive mechanism (CLI or Config File).
* **AC8.2  Successful Execution:** The system shall successfully generate documents using each supported AI provider.
* **AC8.3  Fallback Mechanism:** If the primary AI provider fails, the system shall gracefully fallback to a secondary provider, if available.


**IX.  Modular Processor Architecture**

* **AC9.1  Extensibility:** The system's modular architecture shall allow for the easy addition of new document processors without modifying core code.  A new document type should be easily added following the documented process.


These acceptance criteria will be used to formally test and validate the ADPA system before release.  Any deviations from these criteria will require remediation before the system is considered complete and acceptable.
