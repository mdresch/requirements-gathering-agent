# Procurement Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Procurement Management Plan outlines the processes for acquiring goods and services required for the successful completion of the ADPA project.  Given the project's reliance on AI services (Azure OpenAI, potentially Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama), procurement will primarily focus on these cloud-based services and any necessary third-party libraries or tools.  This plan adheres to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.

**2. Procurement Planning**

**2.1 Procurement Strategy:**  The procurement strategy will be a combination of direct purchase (for cloud services with established pricing models) and competitive bidding (for any significant third-party tools or services that may arise during the project).  The primary objective is to secure cost-effective, high-quality AI services and tools while minimizing procurement risks.

**2.2 Make-or-Buy Decisions:**  The core functionality of the ADPA (AI model interaction, document generation, and CLI) will be developed in-house.  AI services will be procured from cloud providers.  Any specialized libraries or tools deemed necessary will be evaluated on a make-or-buy basis, considering factors such as cost, time, expertise, and risk.

**2.3 Procurement Process:**  The procurement process will follow these steps:

    * **Needs Assessment:** Identify and document specific AI service requirements (model type, token limits, throughput, etc.) and any necessary third-party tools.
    * **Supplier Selection:** Identify potential suppliers based on needs assessment, reputation, and cost.
    * **Request for Proposal (RFP)/Quotation (RFQ):**  Develop and issue RFPs/RFQs for competitive bidding where appropriate.
    * **Supplier Evaluation:** Evaluate proposals/quotations based on predefined criteria (cost, quality, risk, compliance).
    * **Contract Negotiation:** Negotiate contract terms and conditions with selected suppliers.
    * **Contract Administration:**  Manage contracts throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring compliance and resolving any disputes.
    * **Contract Closure:** Formalize contract closure upon completion of the procurement process.

**2.4 Procurement Documents:**

    * **Procurement Management Plan:** This document.
    * **Procurement Statement of Work (SOW):**  Detailed description of required services for each AI provider or third-party tool.
    * **Contracts:** Formal agreements with suppliers outlining deliverables, payment terms, and other relevant conditions.
    * **Change Requests:** Formal documentation for any changes to the procurement scope or contracts.
    * **Supplier Performance Evaluation:** Records of supplier performance throughout the project.

**2.5 Risk Management:**  The primary procurement risks include:

    * **Vendor Lock-in:**  Mitigation: Evaluate multiple AI providers and choose solutions with open APIs and standards-based interfaces where possible.
    * **Cost Overruns:** Mitigation:  Establish clear budgets, obtain multiple quotes, and closely monitor costs.
    * **Service Outages:** Mitigation: Select reputable providers with strong SLAs and service guarantees.
    * **Data Security and Privacy:** Mitigation:  Ensure selected providers comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    * **Compliance Issues:** Mitigation:  Verify compliance with PMBOK standards and relevant regulatory requirements for all procured goods and services.


**3. Conduct Procurements**

This phase involves executing the procurement processes defined in Section 2.  This will include:

* **Sending RFPs/RFQs:** To relevant AI providers and potential third-party tool vendors.
* **Evaluating Proposals:**  Using a weighted scoring system based on pre-defined criteria (cost, quality, risk, compliance).
* **Negotiating Contracts:**  Ensuring favorable terms and conditions.
* **Awarding Contracts:**  Formally selecting and contracting with chosen suppliers.


**4. Control Procurements**

This phase involves managing the procured goods and services throughout the project lifecycle. This includes:

* **Contract Administration:**  Monitoring supplier performance, managing change requests, and resolving any disputes.
* **Payment Processing:**  Making timely payments to suppliers as per contract terms.
* **Performance Reporting:**  Regularly reporting on procurement status and performance to project stakeholders.

**5. Procurement Closure**

This final phase involves formally closing out the procurement processes.  This includes:

* **Final Payment:**  Making final payments to suppliers.
* **Contract Closure:**  Formally terminating contracts.
* **Document Archiving:**  Archiving all procurement-related documents for future reference.
* **Lessons Learned:**  Documenting lessons learned from the procurement process to improve future procurement activities.


**6. Procurement Budget**

A detailed budget for AI services will be established based on estimated usage and pricing from selected providers.  This budget will be regularly monitored and reported upon.  Contingency funds will be included to account for potential cost overruns.


**7.  Stakeholders**

Key stakeholders involved in procurement decisions include:

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall procurement management.
* **Technical Lead:**  Provides technical expertise for evaluating AI services and tools.
* **Finance Manager:**  Reviews and approves procurement budgets and payments.
* **Legal Counsel:**  Reviews and approves contract terms and conditions.


This Procurement Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the ADPA project lifecycle.  Any significant changes will be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
