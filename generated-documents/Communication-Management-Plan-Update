To: ADPA Project Manager From: PMO Director Date: 2025-07-29 Subject: Directive: Integration of Strategic Language into all ADPA Program Communications

This directive is effective immediately.

1. Purpose

To ensure all communications related to the ADPA program accurately reflect its strategic importance and value to the organization, as defined in the Strategic Business Case. This will align all stakeholders—from the core team to executive leadership—with a unified and powerful vision for the program.

2. Mandated Strategic Language

The following key phrases, drawn directly from the Strategic Business Case, must be incorporated into relevant stakeholder communications where appropriate. These concepts frame ADPA not as a simple IT project, but as a core business transformation initiative.

Core Identity:

"Platform for Innovation"
"Sustainable Competitive Advantage"
"Thought leadership in digital transformation"
Value Proposition & Benefits:

"AI-Driven Automation"
"Enhanced Organizational Agility"
"Drives data-driven decision-making"
"Accelerates time-to-market"
3. Implementation in Communication Channels

This strategic language shall be integrated into the following communication artifacts, as defined in the Communication Management Plan:

Communication Artifact	Audience	Required Action
Project Status Reports	Sponsor, Steering Committee, Business Leads	The executive summary section must connect progress and milestones back to these strategic themes (e.g., "This milestone enhances our 'Platform for Innovation' by...").
Steering Committee Presentations	Executive Leadership	All presentations must open by reinforcing the program's role in achieving "Sustainable Competitive Advantage" and "digital transformation."
Program Kick-offs & Town Halls	All Stakeholders	The program's vision must be explicitly stated using this language to set the context and inspire the team.
External Communications (if any)	Partners, Industry	Position ADPA as a source of "Thought leadership" and a key differentiator in the market.
Change Requests (e.g., CR-001)	Steering Committee	The justification for any significant change must be linked to its impact on achieving these strategic outcomes.
4. Rationale

Consistent use of this language is a critical change management tool. It elevates the team's perspective from completing tasks to delivering strategic value. It ensures that when we request resources, justify changes, or report progress, we are speaking the language of the business and reinforcing the executive commitment to this program.

The Palantir Foundry integration (CR-001) is the first major test of this directive. The Change Request and all supporting communications must clearly articulate how the integration is essential for realizing our vision of ADPA as a true "Platform for Innovation."

Please ensure the entire project team understands and adopts this communication strategy. This is a non-negotiable element of our program governance moving forward.
