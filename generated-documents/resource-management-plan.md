# Resource Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This Resource Management Plan outlines the approach for identifying, acquiring, managing, and utilizing resources required for the successful completion of the ADPA project.  The plan addresses human resources, material resources, and financial resources, aligning with the project's objectives and constraints.  Given the project's AI-driven nature, resource allocation will focus on efficient utilization of computational resources and expertise in AI development and project management.


## 2. Resource Identification

The ADPA project requires the following resources:

**2.1 Human Resources:**

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project planning, execution, monitoring, and control.  Requires expertise in Agile methodologies and AI project management.  (1 FTE, dedicated)
* **Software Developers (2 FTEs):**  Experienced in TypeScript, Node.js, and AI integration.  Proficiency in testing and deployment is crucial. (2 FTEs, dedicated)
* **AI/ML Specialist (0.5 FTE):** Expertise in large language model interaction, prompt engineering, and optimization of AI models for document generation.  (0.5 FTE, initially part-time, potentially full-time based on project needs)
* **Technical Writer (0.25 FTE):** Responsible for creating and maintaining user documentation, tutorials, and training materials. (0.25 FTE, initially part-time)
* **QA Tester (0.25 FTE):** Responsible for testing functionality and verifying PMBOK compliance. (0.25 FTE, part-time)


**2.2 Material Resources:**

* **Software Licenses:**  Access to Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and potentially GitHub AI or other relevant AI providers.  Licenses will be procured based on usage requirements and cost-effectiveness analysis.
* **Hardware:**  Development machines with sufficient processing power and memory for AI model interaction.  Cloud computing resources (Azure) will be utilized for computationally intensive tasks.
* **Collaboration Tools:**  Git repository (GitHub), project management software (Jira or equivalent), communication platforms (Slack or equivalent).


**2.3 Financial Resources:**

* **Personnel Costs:** Salaries and benefits for the project team.
* **Software Licenses:** Costs associated with AI provider subscriptions.
* **Cloud Computing:** Azure cloud infrastructure costs.
* **Hardware:** Costs of development machines, if required.
* **Contingency:**  A buffer for unforeseen expenses.


## 3. Resource Acquisition

Human resources will be acquired through internal allocation and potential external hiring, based on skills gaps and project needs.  Material resources, including software licenses and cloud computing resources, will be procured through established procurement processes.  Financial resources will be allocated from the project budget.


## 4. Resource Allocation

Resource allocation will follow a phased approach, prioritizing tasks based on the project critical path and dependencies.  The initial phase will focus on core functionality development and AI integration.  Subsequent phases will incorporate additional features and documentation.  A detailed resource allocation schedule will be maintained in the project's schedule management plan.


## 5. Resource Leveling and Smoothing

Resource leveling and smoothing techniques will be employed to balance workload across the project team and optimize resource utilization. This involves analyzing resource demands, identifying potential conflicts, and adjusting schedules to minimize resource overallocation and ensure timely project completion.  Tools like Microsoft Project or similar project management software will assist in this process.


## 6. Resource Control

Regular monitoring and control of resources will be carried out throughout the project lifecycle. This includes tracking actual resource usage against planned usage, identifying and addressing any deviations, and implementing corrective actions as needed.  Regular progress reports and resource utilization dashboards will be utilized to ensure transparency and accountability.


## 7. Resource Monitoring and Reporting

Resource utilization will be monitored weekly, with reports generated to track progress, identify potential issues, and inform decision-making.  Key metrics to be tracked include:

* **Burn-down charts:**  Tracking progress against planned effort.
* **Resource utilization:**  Percentage of allocated time actually utilized.
* **Cost tracking:**  Monitoring actual costs against the project budget.
* **AI model usage:**  Tracking the consumption of AI provider resources.


## 8. Risk Management

Potential risks related to resource management include:

* **Skill shortages:** Difficulty finding qualified personnel with AI expertise.
* **Cost overruns:** Exceeding the allocated budget.
* **AI provider limitations:**  Unexpected limitations or downtime of AI services.
* **Resource conflicts:**  Competition for resources across multiple projects.

Mitigation strategies for these risks will be developed and documented in the project's risk management plan.


## 9. Communication Plan

Regular communication will be maintained with stakeholders regarding resource allocation, utilization, and any potential issues.  This will involve weekly progress reports, regular team meetings, and ad-hoc communication as needed.


## 10.  Resource Release

Upon project completion, resources will be released according to the project closure procedures.  This includes returning unused licenses, releasing hardware, and reassigning personnel to other projects.  A post-project review will be conducted to evaluate resource utilization and identify areas for improvement in future projects.
