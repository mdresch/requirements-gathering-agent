# Schedule Network Diagram

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This schedule network diagram outlines the key tasks and dependencies for the development and launch of the ADPA project.  Due to the iterative and evolving nature of AI development, precise durations are estimates and subject to change.  This diagram focuses on major milestones and phases.

**Legend:**

* **Node:** Represents a task or milestone.
* **Arrow:** Indicates a dependency between tasks (task on arrow's tail must complete before task on arrow's head can begin).
* **Duration (Weeks):** Estimated duration of each task.  These are high-level estimates and may vary.
* **Critical Path:**  Highlighted in bold to show the sequence of tasks that directly impact the project's overall completion time.  Any delay on these tasks will delay the project.

**Critical Path (in bold):** Project Charter -> Core Feature Dev -> PMBOK Doc Gen -> VCS Integration -> Public Launch

**Task Descriptions:**

* **Project Charter:** Formal authorization and scope definition.
* **Core Feature Dev:** Development of core document generation capabilities (PMBOK documents).
* **Technical Design:** Design and implementation of the technical design document system.
* **AI Provider Int.:** Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* **Beta Testing:** Internal testing and feedback iteration.
* **PMBOK Doc Gen.:**  Development of PMBOK document generation templates and logic.
* **Context Manager:** Development and optimization of the context management system.
* **CLI Development:** Development and testing of the command-line interface.
* **Public Launch:** Official release to npm and public announcement.
* **VCS Integration:**  Implementation of the built-in version control system.
* **Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive testing and validation.
* **Documentation:** Creation and updating of user documentation.
* **Ongoing Support:** Maintenance, bug fixes, feature updates.


**Notes:**

* This diagram represents a simplified view.  Many sub-tasks exist within each major task.
* Task durations are estimates and may need adjustment based on resource availability and unforeseen challenges.
* Dependencies may be added or adjusted as the project progresses.
* The critical path highlights the most time-sensitive tasks.  Focus on these tasks to keep the project on schedule.


This diagram provides a visual representation of the project timeline and dependencies.  It is a living document and should be updated regularly to reflect the project's progress and any changes in scope or schedule.  A more detailed Gantt chart with specific task breakdowns would be beneficial for internal project management.
