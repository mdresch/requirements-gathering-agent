# Schedule Network Diagram

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This schedule network diagram outlines the key tasks and dependencies for the development and release of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project.  Due to the iterative and AI-driven nature of the project, precise durations are estimates and may fluctuate based on AI model performance and feedback loops.  This diagram uses a simplified representation for clarity; a more detailed Gantt chart is available in the project's planning artifacts.

**Key:**

* **Node:** Represents a task or milestone.
* **Arrow:** Indicates a dependency; the arrow points from the predecessor task to the successor task.
* **Duration:** Estimated duration in weeks (Wk). This is an approximation and subject to change.
* **Critical Path:** Highlighted in bold.  Delays on these tasks directly impact the project completion date.

**Critical Path:** Project Start -> Core Feature Dev -> Initial Testing -> Beta Release -> Feedback Cycle -> Final Release -> Project Complete (Total estimated time: 22 weeks)

**Note:** This is a high-level representation.  Individual tasks within each node (e.g., "Core Feature Dev") are detailed in the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and associated task lists.  The durations are estimates and are subject to change based on various factors including, but not limited to, testing, feedback incorporation, and AI model performance.  The actual schedule may be represented more accurately using a Gantt chart, which allows for more detailed task breakdown and resource allocation.
