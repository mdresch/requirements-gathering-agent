# Schedule Network Diagram

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This schedule network diagram represents a high-level overview of the ADPA project's key activities and their dependencies. Due to the iterative and AI-driven nature of the project, precise durations are difficult to estimate.  This diagram focuses on major milestones and dependencies rather than granular task scheduling.  Specific task durations would need to be further defined in a detailed project schedule.


**Legend:**

* **Node:** Represents a project activity or milestone.
* **Arrow:** Indicates a dependency between activities. The arrow points from the predecessor activity to the successor activity.
* **Duration:**  Estimated duration (in weeks, represented as "Wk").  Note: These are *rough estimates* and may vary significantly based on AI performance and unforeseen challenges.
* **Milestone:** Represented by a diamond shape.

**Activity Descriptions:**

1. **Project Inception & Authorization (Milestone):**  Securing executive sponsorship and formal project authorization.
2. **Strategic Foundation:** Defining project scope, objectives, stakeholders, and risks using the Context Foundation approach.
3. **Technical Design:**  Developing the Technical Design Document Generation System, including AI prompts and templates.
4. **Technical Design System Implementation:** Building and testing the 10 specialized technical document processors.
5. **Business Communication Translator:** Developing the system to translate technical context into strategic business documents.
6. **Beta Release (Milestone):** Initial release of the core functionality for testing and feedback.
7. **Version 2.1 Development (Milestone):**  Incorporating feedback and improvements from the beta release.
8. **Ongoing Development & Maintenance:** Continuous improvement, bug fixes, and new feature development.
9. **Version 2.2 Development (Ongoing):** Planning and execution of subsequent feature releases.


**Critical Path:**  The critical path (longest path through the network) is likely to be the sequence of activities from Project Inception to Ongoing Development & Maintenance, as these activities are highly interdependent.

**Note:** This is a simplified representation. A more detailed Gantt chart or project management software would be needed to capture all tasks, dependencies, and resource allocations. The durations are highly speculative and subject to change based on the performance of the AI models and the development process.
