Revised Action Plan: ADPA & Palantir Foundry Integration
To: ADPA Project Manager From: PMO Director Date: 2025-07-29 Subject: Formal Action Plan for ADPA-Palantir Foundry Integration Initiative

Further to our strategic review, the plan to integrate the ADPA framework with Palantir Foundry is approved to proceed. The following action plan, which incorporates key recommendations from our senior advisory review, will serve as the guiding directive. This initiative is to be managed via a formal Change Request against the ADPA Project Charter.

Phase 1: Discovery & Feasibility Analysis
Original Mandate: Define requirements and assess technical feasibility.
Enhanced Directive (incorporating recommendations):
Strategic Ontology Alignment (DMBOK): The Solution Architect and Business Analyst will not just map data models but will conduct a strategic alignment with the Foundry Ontology. The goal is to ensure ADPA understands and leverages Foundry's core business concepts (e.g., Projects, Risks, Milestones) and their relationships, not just raw data fields.
Explore "Write-Back" Capabilities: The feasibility study must extend beyond data querying. Assess the technical and business value of enabling ADPA to perform actions in Foundry (e.g., creating a new risk object based on analysis). This aligns with our core objective of moving from simple documentation to true enterprise automation.

Phase 2: Planning & Design
Original Mandate: Formalize the project plan, change request, and security design.
Enhanced Directive (incorporating recommendations):
Proactive & Specific Risk Management (PMBOK): The Project Manager will pre-populate the risk register with categories specific to this integration. At a minimum, this will include:
Technical Risk: Foundry API version changes, performance latency.
Data Risk: "Ontology Drift," data quality/freshness issues from Foundry.
Operational Risk: Lack of skilled maintenance personnel post-deployment.
Adoption Risk: User trust erosion due to early-stage AI errors.
Inherit Foundry Security Controls (ISO 27002): The security design must prioritize inheriting and leveraging Foundry's native granular security model. The integration must operate on behalf of the authenticated user, ensuring ADPA can only access context that the user is already authorized to see in Foundry. This is a more secure and efficient approach than rebuilding parallel controls.
Phase 3: Implementation & Testing
Mandate: Build and validate the integration.
(No changes to this phase's directive, as it remains fundamentally sound.)
Phase 4: Deployment & Operationalization
Original Mandate: Roll out the integration and monitor performance.
Enhanced Directive (incorporating recommendations):
Formalize AI Performance & Feedback Loop: A dedicated workstream for "AI Performance & Feedback Management" will be established.
Mechanism: Implement a user feedback system (e.g., "thumbs up/down") within the ADPA interface.
Triage Process: All feedback must be captured, triaged, and routed. This process will differentiate between issues related to the user's prompt, the context from Foundry, or the LLM's reasoning.
Actionable Insights: This feedback loop is not just for bug-fixing; it is a strategic asset for driving the continuous improvement of our data quality, integration logic, and AI performance, directly supporting our KPI for user satisfaction.
