# Validate Scope Process: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the process for validating the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The RGA project aims to deliver an AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  This validation process ensures that the delivered system meets the defined requirements and is acceptable to stakeholders.  Given the project's focus on automated documentation generation, the validation process emphasizes both functional correctness and the quality of the generated documents.

## 2. Process Overview

The validation process is a phased approach, aligning with the project's iterative development methodology.  Validation occurs at key milestones: after each major feature implementation and upon final project completion.

**Key Objectives:**

* Verify that the generated documents are compliant with PMBOK standards.
* Confirm the accuracy and completeness of the generated content.
* Ensure the system's usability and performance meet expectations.
* Obtain formal acceptance from key stakeholders (Development Team, Product Owner, Architecture Team).
* Document all validation activities and results.

**Process Timing:**

* **Milestone Validation:** Following completion of each major functional area (e.g., PMBOK charter generation, stakeholder register generation).
* **Final Validation:** Upon completion of all features and before project closure.

## 3. Validation Approach

The validation approach employs a combination of automated testing, manual reviews, and stakeholder feedback.

**Inspection Methods:**

* **Automated Unit and Integration Tests:** Verify individual components and their interactions.  These tests will cover the core functionality of generating various PMBOK documents.
* **Manual Code Review:**  Ensuring code quality, adherence to coding standards, and maintainability.
* **Functional Testing:**  Testing the generation of various PMBOK documents with different input datasets to verify accuracy and completeness.
* **Performance Testing:**  Measuring the system's speed and resource consumption under various load conditions.
* **Documentation Review:**  Assessing the clarity, accuracy, and completeness of the user documentation and any generated templates.
* **Compliance Testing:**  Verifying adherence to PMBOK standards using a checklist and potentially automated tools.


**Review Techniques:**

* **Formal Walkthroughs:**  Structured reviews of the system's functionality and generated documents with the development team and stakeholders.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  End-users will test the system's ease of use and effectiveness in generating relevant documentation.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria are categorized into functional, non-functional, and documentation requirements.  These are based on the requirements outlined in `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` and `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`.

**Functional Criteria:**

* Successful generation of PMBOK-compliant project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.
* Accurate and complete information in generated documents.
* Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) as defined in the architecture document.
* Successful integration with specified APIs (`@azure-rest/ai-inference`, etc.).
* Correct handling of various input data formats and structures.
* Robust error handling and reporting.

**Non-Functional Criteria:**

* Performance:  Document generation within acceptable timeframes (defined in performance testing plan).
* Usability:  Intuitive and user-friendly command-line interface.
* Maintainability:  Clean, well-documented, and modular codebase.
* Scalability:  Ability to handle increasing data volumes and project complexity.


**Documentation Criteria:**

* Comprehensive and user-friendly user documentation.
* Clear and concise instructions for using the CLI interface.
* Well-structured and easily navigable documentation.


## 5. Validation Activities

**Pre-validation:**

* Ensure all test cases are prepared and automated tests are ready to run.
* Prepare the test data sets representing diverse project scenarios.
* Notify stakeholders of upcoming validation activities and schedule review meetings.

**Validation Execution:**

1. **Automated Testing:** Execute all unit, integration, and performance tests.  Document the results.
2. **Manual Testing:** Conduct functional testing using various input data sets.
3. **Stakeholder Review:** Present the system and generated documents to stakeholders for review and feedback.
4. **UAT:** Conduct user acceptance testing with representative end-users.

**Post-validation:**

* Document all validation results, including test results, stakeholder feedback, and any identified issues.
* Address any identified issues and re-run tests as necessary.
* Obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders.
* Update the project documentation to reflect the validation results.


## 6. Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities

* **Development Team:** Executes automated and manual testing, addresses identified issues, and provides technical support during validation.
* **Product Owner:** Reviews generated documents for accuracy and completeness, provides feedback on usability, and approves the final product.
* **Architecture Team:** Reviews the system's architecture and design for compliance with established standards.

## 7. Documentation Framework

All validation activities, results, and issues will be documented in a dedicated validation report.  This report will include:

* Test plans and test cases.
* Test results and logs.
* Stakeholder feedback.
* Identified issues and their resolutions.
* Acceptance criteria checklist.
* Formal acceptance documentation.


## 8. Non-conformance Management

Any identified issues that prevent the system from meeting the acceptance criteria will be logged, analyzed, and addressed.  A prioritized list of issues will be maintained, with resolutions tracked and documented.  Re-validation will be performed after issue resolution.


## 9. Continuous Improvement

Lessons learned from the validation process will be documented and used to improve future releases of the RGA tool.  This includes reviewing the validation process itself for effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement.  Stakeholder feedback will be a key input to this process.
