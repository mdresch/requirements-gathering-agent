# Define Scope Process: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, focusing on establishing a clear and comprehensive understanding of the project's boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  This process leverages the project's unique AI-driven capabilities and the existing foundational documents generated by ADPA itself (e.g., `BusinessCase.md`, `StakeholderRegister.md`, `RiskRegister.md`).

## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Define the scope of ADPA's functionality, including core features and planned enhancements.
* Clearly delineate the boundaries of the project, specifying what is included and excluded.
* Establish measurable and verifiable acceptance criteria for all deliverables.
* Establish a formal scope baseline for change control and management.
* Leverage ADPA's existing output to inform and refine the scope definition.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Leverage Existing ADPA Output:** Analyze and refine the scope based on the already generated documents (`BusinessCase.md`, `StakeholderRegister.md`, `ProjectScopeStatement.md`, etc.).  Identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing further clarification.
2. **Requirements Analysis and Refinement:** Review existing functional and non-functional requirements, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and addressing any newly identified needs.  Prioritize requirements based on value and feasibility.
3. **Scope Statement Development:**  Create a comprehensive project scope statement, including product scope description, project deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, assumptions, and exclusions.  This statement will be a formal document, building upon the existing `ProjectScopeStatement.md` generated by ADPA.
4. **Stakeholder Validation and Review:** Present the draft scope statement to key stakeholders for review and approval.  Address any feedback and iterate until consensus is achieved. This review will leverage the stakeholder engagement plan (`StakeholderEngagementPlan.md`).
5. **Formal Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:** Obtain formal sign-off on the finalized scope statement from the project sponsor. This approved document serves as the project's scope baseline.
6. **Scope Management Plan Development:** Develop a detailed Scope Management Plan outlining the process for managing scope changes throughout the project lifecycle. This plan will address change request processes, variance analysis, and reporting mechanisms.


## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* Project Charter (`ProjectCharter.md`): Defines high-level scope, objectives, and authority.
* Requirements Documentation: Existing functional and non-functional requirements, including those identified within ADPA's generated documents.
* Stakeholder Register (`StakeholderRegister.md`): Identifies key stakeholders and their interests.
* Risk Register (`RiskRegister.md`): Identifies potential risks that could impact scope.
* Enterprise Environmental Factors: Organizational policies, standards, and constraints.
* ADPA Generated Documents:  All relevant documents produced by ADPA, particularly the initial `ProjectScopeStatement.md`.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* Expert Judgment: Leverage the expertise of project team members and stakeholders.
* Product Analysis: Analyze the current capabilities of ADPA and identify areas for improvement.
* Alternative Identification: Explore alternative approaches and solutions to meet project objectives.
* Facilitated Workshops: Conduct collaborative workshops to gather stakeholder input and address concerns.
* Document Review and Analysis: Critically examine existing documentation to identify gaps and potential issues.


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis and Refinement:**

* Review and refine the existing requirements documented in various sources (including ADPA's output).
* Prioritize requirements based on business value, feasibility, and risk.
* Address any conflicting requirements or ambiguities.
* Add new requirements as needed, ensuring they align with the overall project goals.

**Scope Boundaries Definition:**

* Clearly define what functionalities and features are included within the scope of ADPA.
* Explicitly list what is excluded from the project scope to avoid scope creep.
* Define interfaces and dependencies with other systems or tools.
* Identify any constraints that may limit the project's scope.

**Acceptance Criteria Definition:**

* Define clear and measurable acceptance criteria for each deliverable.
* Specify the standards and benchmarks that must be met for successful project completion.
* Define how success will be measured and verified.  This includes performance metrics, quality standards, and adherence to PMBOK guidelines.


## 5. Project Scope Statement (Revised)

The project scope statement will be a formal document, building upon and revising the existing `ProjectScopeStatement.md` generated by ADPA.  It will include:

* **Product Scope Description:** A detailed description of the capabilities and functionalities of ADPA.
* **Project Deliverables:** A list of specific outputs that will be produced by the project.  This includes software releases, documentation, training materials, and any other tangible outputs.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Measurable criteria that define when each deliverable is considered complete and acceptable.
* **Project Constraints:** Any limitations or restrictions on the project, such as budget, timeline, or resource availability.
* **Assumptions:** Any factors that are assumed to be true but may not be guaranteed.
* **Project Exclusions:** A clear list of features, functionalities, or tasks that are explicitly excluded from the project scope.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

The deliverables framework will be organized to reflect the project's phases and objectives.  This will include:

* **Software Deliverables:** Specific software releases, including version numbers and features.
* **Documentation Deliverables:**  User manuals, technical documentation, API specifications, training materials, etc.
* **Quality Assurance Deliverables:**  Test plans, test results, and quality reports.
* **Project Management Deliverables:**  Status reports, risk assessments, and change requests.


## 7. Validation Process

The validation process will ensure that the defined scope is accurate, complete, and meets stakeholder expectations.  This involves:

* **Internal Review:**  Project team members will review the scope statement to ensure completeness and accuracy.
* **Stakeholder Review:**  The scope statement will be presented to key stakeholders for review and feedback.  This will utilize the stakeholder engagement plan.
* **Formal Approval:**  The project sponsor will provide formal approval of the finalized scope statement.
* **Baseline Establishment:** The approved scope statement will be established as the project's baseline for change control.

This rigorous process ensures that the project's scope is well-defined, understood, and agreed upon by all stakeholders, setting the stage for successful project execution.  The iterative nature of this process, leveraging ADPA's own capabilities, ensures a dynamic and responsive approach to scope management.
