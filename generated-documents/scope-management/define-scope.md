# Define Scope Process: Project Backup Vermigerous

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automating the monthly backup process and ensuring secure and reliable data recovery.  The project aims to improve the existing backup system by implementing robust automation, enhanced security measures, and rigorous validation procedures.

## 2. Process Overview

This process defines the project scope, boundaries, and acceptance criteria, laying the groundwork for successful project execution.  The primary objective is to create a fully automated, secure, and verifiable monthly backup system for Project Backup Vermigerous.

**Key Objectives:**

* Develop a comprehensive scope statement detailing all project inclusions and exclusions.
* Define clear boundaries between the project and other systems or processes.
* Establish measurable and verifiable acceptance criteria for successful project completion.
* Create a baseline scope for future reference and change management.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**  Analyze existing backup procedures, identify shortcomings, and define the necessary functionalities for the automated system. This includes defining the scope of data to be backed up, storage requirements, recovery time objectives (RTOs), and recovery point objectives (RPOs).
2. **Scope Statement Development:**  Document the project scope, including all deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, constraints, and exclusions.  This will be a living document, subject to review and approval.
3. **Stakeholder Validation:**  Present the scope statement to key stakeholders (IT, Operations, Management) for review and feedback.  Address any concerns or ambiguities.
4. **Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:**  Obtain formal approval of the scope statement from relevant stakeholders.  This approved document serves as the project scope baseline.

## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* **Project Charter:**  The initiating document outlining the project's high-level goals and objectives.
* **Existing Backup System Documentation:**  Details of the current backup procedures, including software, hardware, and processes.
* **System Architecture Diagrams:**  Visual representation of the current system and proposed changes.
* **Security Requirements:**  Policies and guidelines for data security and compliance.
* **Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs):**  Defined service level agreements (SLAs) for data recovery.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment:**  Leveraging the experience of IT professionals to assess risks and define appropriate solutions.
* **Prototyping:**  Developing a proof-of-concept to validate technical feasibility and user requirements.
* **SWOT Analysis:** Identifying strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to the project.
* **Cost-Benefit Analysis:**  Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of different solutions.


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:**

* **Functional Requirements:**  Automated monthly backups, incremental/differential backup strategies, secure storage, metadata tagging, automated recovery testing, monitoring and alerting, data integrity checks (checksums).
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**  Security (encryption at rest and in transit), scalability, maintainability, reliability, performance (backup and recovery times).
* **Data Identification:**  Precisely define all data sources that require backup.
* **Backup Strategy:**  Determine the optimal backup strategy (full, incremental, differential) based on storage capacity, RPOs, and RTOs.
* **Storage Selection:**  Choose a secure and reliable storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM).


**Scope Boundaries:**

* **Inclusions:**  Automated backup scheduling, data encryption, integrity checks, metadata tagging, automated recovery testing, monitoring and alerting, secure storage.
* **Exclusions:**  Development of new applications or systems, data migration from legacy systems (unless explicitly included), user training beyond initial system onboarding.
* **Interfaces:**  Integration with existing monitoring systems, storage platforms, and applications.


## 5. Project Scope Statement (Example)

**Project:** Project Backup Vermigerous - Automated Backup System

**Product Scope Description:**  This project will deliver a fully automated monthly backup system for Project Backup Vermigerous, ensuring data integrity, security, and reliable recovery. The system will utilize incremental backups, secure storage (Azure Blob Storage with WORM), and automated validation procedures.

**Project Deliverables:**

* Automated backup script (PowerShell or equivalent).
* Secure storage infrastructure in Azure Blob Storage.
* Monitoring and alerting system integrated with Azure Monitor.
* Automated recovery testing procedures.
* Comprehensive documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Successful completion of 3 consecutive monthly automated backups without errors.
* Successful restoration of a complete system from backup within the defined RTO.
* All backups encrypted using AES-256.
* System monitoring and alerting function correctly.

**Project Constraints:**

* Budget limitations.
* Timeline constraints.
* Existing infrastructure limitations.

**Assumptions:**

* Access to Azure subscription and necessary resources.
* Availability of skilled personnel.

**Project Exclusions:**

* Data migration from legacy systems.
* Development of new applications.
* User training beyond initial system setup.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

This section will detail each deliverable in more depth, including specifications, acceptance criteria, and responsibilities.  This will be a separate document.


## 7. Validation Process

The scope will be validated through multiple reviews and approvals:

* **Technical Review:**  IT team will review the technical feasibility and design.
* **Business Review:**  Business stakeholders will validate that the scope meets their requirements.
* **Management Approval:**  Project sponsor will formally approve the scope.

Upon approval, the scope statement will be baselined and any changes will be managed through a formal change control process.


This Define Scope document provides a framework.  Further details will be elaborated in subsequent documentation.
