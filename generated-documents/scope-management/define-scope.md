# Define Scope Process Document  
**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.9

---

## 1. Introduction

The Define Scope process for the ADPA project establishes a detailed and actionable description of the project and product scope. This process is critical to ensure alignment with enterprise standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0), compliance requirements, and stakeholder expectations. It provides the foundation for planning, execution, and control of the development and deployment of the ADPA modular automation framework.

## 2. Process Overview

### Key Objectives

- Develop a comprehensive project scope statement reflecting ADPA’s multi-framework automation capabilities.
- Clearly delineate project inclusions and exclusions, focusing on AI-powered document generation, multi-provider AI integration, and enterprise-grade security.
- Establish measurable acceptance criteria aligned with industry standards and enterprise compliance.
- Create a robust scope baseline to guide development, integration, and deployment activities.

### Process Flow

1. **Requirements Analysis** — Gather and analyze business, technical, and regulatory requirements related to ADPA’s automation framework.
2. **Scope Statement Development** — Formulate the detailed project and product scope, including deliverables and boundaries.
3. **Stakeholder Validation** — Engage key stakeholders across business analysis, project management, and IT security for review and feedback.
4. **Scope Approval & Baseline Establishment** — Secure formal approval from project sponsors and establish the scope baseline for monitoring.
