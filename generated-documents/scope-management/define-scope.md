# Define Scope Process: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This project aims to revolutionize enterprise business analysis by automating the generation of BABOK v3-compliant frameworks using an API-first approach. The Define Scope process will establish a clear and concise understanding of the project's boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria, ensuring alignment among stakeholders and providing a solid foundation for successful project execution.  The unique nature of this project, focusing on AI-driven automation of complex business analysis tasks, requires a meticulous approach to scope definition.

## 2. Process Overview

The Define Scope process for this project will follow these key objectives and a structured flow:

**Key Objectives:**

*   Define the functional and non-functional requirements for the ADPA API and its associated components (CLI, documentation, etc.).
*   Clearly delineate the project boundaries, specifying what is included and, crucially, what is explicitly excluded from the project scope.  This includes addressing limitations in AI capabilities and the scope of supported standards (e.g., currently BABOK v3, with future expansion to PMBOK and DMBOK).
*   Establish measurable and verifiable acceptance criteria for all deliverables, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and the project's overall goals.  This will include performance benchmarks (generation speed, accuracy), output quality (compliance with standards, readability), and security considerations.
*   Create a comprehensive scope baseline that serves as the foundation for future change management and scope control.  This baseline will be meticulously documented and version-controlled.

**Process Flow:**

1.  **Requirements Elicitation and Analysis:**  Leveraging existing documentation (README, requirements documents, etc.) and stakeholder input,  thoroughly analyze functional and non-functional requirements.  This includes clarifying ambiguities and resolving conflicting requirements.
2.  **Scope Statement Development:**  Develop a formal project scope statement that incorporates the analyzed requirements, boundaries, exclusions, and acceptance criteria.  This will be a living document, subject to review and iteration.
3.  **Stakeholder Validation:**  Present the draft scope statement to key stakeholders (development team, product owner, business analysts, etc.) for review and feedback.  Address any concerns or disagreements through collaborative discussions and revisions.  This step leverages the project's existing stakeholder engagement framework.
4.  **Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:**  Once stakeholder consensus is achieved, formally approve the scope statement. This approved document constitutes the project's scope baseline, which will be managed and controlled throughout the project lifecycle.  Version control will be implemented using a suitable system (e.g., Git).

## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

*   Project Charter (existing project metadata and description)
*   Requirements Documentation (existing README, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md`, etc.)
*   Stakeholder Register (implied from project documentation; to be formally documented)
*   Enterprise Environmental Factors (implied from the Fortune 500 validation scenario and regulatory compliance requirements â€“ Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX)
*   API Specifications (`api-specs/`)
*   Existing Test Data (`test-data/`)

**Tools and Techniques:**

*   Expert Judgment (from the development team and business analysts)
*   Product Analysis (review of existing functionalities and capabilities)
*   Alternative Identification (consideration of alternative approaches and technologies)
*   Facilitated Workshops (for stakeholder validation and consensus-building)
*   Requirements Traceability Matrix (to link requirements to deliverables and acceptance criteria)


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:**

*   Detailed review of functional requirements (API endpoints, document generation capabilities, CLI functionality, etc.).
*   Analysis of non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, security, maintainability, usability, etc.).  This will include specific performance targets for document generation speed.
*   Identification of business rules and constraints (e.g., regulatory compliance requirements, data privacy considerations).
*   Analysis of dependencies on external systems and APIs (AI providers, SharePoint, etc.).

**Scope Boundaries:**

*   **Included:**  The development of a production-ready Express.js API for generating BABOK v3-compliant business analysis frameworks, including a comprehensive CLI interface and supporting documentation.  Specific document types to be generated will be explicitly defined. The API will include robust error handling, authentication, and rate limiting.  Integration with specified AI providers will be included.
*   **Excluded:**  Integration with PMBOK and DMBOK at this stage.  Support for custom templates beyond a defined set.  Advanced analytics and reporting features.  Specific integrations with other enterprise systems beyond those explicitly mentioned (e.g., Confluence).  Real-time collaboration features.

## 5. Project Scope Statement (Example Structure)

The complete scope statement will be a separate, formally approved document. This section provides a skeletal structure:

**1. Project Goal:** To develop a production-ready API for generating BABOK v3-compliant business analysis frameworks.

**2. Product Scope:**  An Express.js API with a CLI interface, capable of generating specified BABOK v3 documents from structured input data.  The API will include authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling.

**3. Project Deliverables:**  Functional API, CLI application, comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI spec, user guide), unit tests, integration tests, and deployment scripts.

**4. Acceptance Criteria:**  The API shall generate accurate and complete BABOK v3 documents within a defined timeframe (e.g., under 2 seconds for standard scenarios).  The API shall meet specified security and performance requirements.  All deliverables shall meet defined quality standards.

**5. Project Constraints:**  Budget, timeline, and resource availability.  Dependencies on external AI providers and their APIs.

**6. Assumptions:**  Availability of necessary data and access to required AI APIs.  Stable performance of the AI providers.

**7. Exclusions:**  (As detailed above)

*   **Technical Review:** The development team will review the scope statement for technical feasibility and completeness.
*   **Business Validation:**  Business stakeholders will validate the scope statement against business requirements and objectives.
*   **Sponsor Approval:** The project sponsor will formally approve the final scope statement.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** The approved scope statement will be established as the project baseline.


This detailed Define Scope process, tailored to the unique aspects of the ADPA project, ensures a clear, comprehensive, and achievable project scope, setting the stage for successful execution.
