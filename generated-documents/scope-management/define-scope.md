# Define Scope Process: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework project.  This process will establish a clear, comprehensive, and measurable description of the project and product scope, forming the basis for all subsequent project activities and decisions.  The unique aspects of ADPA, including its AI-powered generation, multi-framework compliance, and enterprise integration capabilities, will be carefully considered throughout this process.

## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Define the scope of the ADPA Framework, encompassing all planned features and functionalities.
* Explicitly define project boundaries and exclusions, preventing scope creep.
* Establish clear and measurable acceptance criteria for each deliverable.
* Create a robust scope baseline to serve as a reference point for future project management.
* Address the specific needs and challenges of integrating multiple AI providers and industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0).

**Process Flow:**

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**  Consolidate requirements from various sources (project charter, stakeholder interviews, documentation review). Analyze for completeness, consistency, and feasibility.  Prioritize requirements based on business value and technical feasibility.
2. **Scope Statement Development:** Draft a comprehensive project scope statement incorporating the refined requirements.  This statement will clearly define the projectâ€™s objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, assumptions, and exclusions.  Particular attention will be paid to defining the scope of AI integration for each provider and the extent of compliance with each targeted framework (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
3. **Stakeholder Review and Validation:** Conduct formal reviews with key stakeholders (development team, business users, project sponsors) to validate the scope statement. Address feedback and incorporate necessary revisions. This will involve demonstrations of core functionalities and discussions concerning the practical application of the framework.
4. **Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:** Obtain formal approval of the scope statement from relevant stakeholders.  Once approved, the scope statement becomes the project scope baseline, a critical element of change management.  A formal change control process will be established to manage any future scope modifications.

## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* **Project Charter:**  The initial project authorization document outlining high-level objectives and constraints.
* **Requirements Documentation:**  Existing documentation detailing functional and non-functional requirements. This will include the README documentation and any supplemental specifications.
* **Stakeholder Register:** A list of all stakeholders and their involvement in the project.
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors:**  Organizational policies, standards, and constraints that influence the project.  This includes the existing IT infrastructure, security policies, and compliance requirements.
* **Technical Specifications:** Detailed technical specifications for API interfaces, database design, and system architecture.


**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment:** Leverage the expertise of experienced developers, business analysts, and project managers to refine the scope definition.
* **Product Analysis:**  Analyze existing similar products and frameworks to identify best practices and potential challenges.
* **Alternative Identification:**  Explore alternative approaches to achieving project objectives and select the most suitable option.
* **Facilitated Workshops:**  Conduct workshops to engage stakeholders in the scope definition process, fostering collaboration and alignment.
* **Prototyping:** Develop functional prototypes to validate key aspects of the scope and gather stakeholder feedback.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  Decompose the project scope into manageable work packages.


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:**  This phase will meticulously analyze the requirements outlined in the project documentation, focusing on:

* **Functional Requirements:**  Detailed description of the system's functionalities, including document generation, AI integration, framework compliance, and API interactions.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**  Defining aspects such as performance, security, scalability, maintainability, and usability.
* **Business Rules:**  Identification and documentation of any business rules that govern the system's operation.
* **Constraint Analysis:**  Identification and assessment of any project constraints, including budgetary limitations, time constraints, technical limitations, and regulatory compliance requirements.

**Defining Scope Boundaries:**  This crucial step will clearly delineate:

* **Inclusions:**  Precisely define the features, functionalities, and deliverables that are part of the project.
* **Exclusions:**  Explicitly state what is *not* included in the project scope, avoiding ambiguity and preventing future disputes.
* **Interfaces:**  Define how the ADPA framework will interact with other systems and applications.
* **Dependencies:** Identify any external dependencies that might impact the project timeline or success.


## 5. Project Scope Statement

The project scope statement will be a comprehensive document containing:

* **Product Scope Description:**  A detailed description of the ADPA Framework, its functionalities, and intended use cases.
* **Project Deliverables:**  A list of all tangible and intangible outputs of the project, including the framework itself, documentation, API specifications, and integration guides.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria for accepting each deliverable.  This will include testing procedures and validation methods for ensuring compliance with industry standards.
* **Project Constraints:**  Any limitations or restrictions that may impact the project, such as budget, timeline, resources, or regulatory compliance.
* **Assumptions:**  Statements that are assumed to be true but have not yet been verified.
* **Project Exclusions:**  A clear list of functionalities or features that are explicitly excluded from the project scope.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

This section will define a detailed framework for all project deliverables, including:

* **Primary Deliverables:**  The core components of the ADPA Framework, such as the CLI, REST API, Admin Interface, and integration modules.
* **Supporting Documentation:**  Comprehensive documentation including user guides, API specifications, technical documentation, and testing reports.
* **Quality Artifacts:**  Test plans, test cases, test results, and code quality metrics.
* **Acceptance Deliverables:**  The final deliverables required for client acceptance, including a fully functional framework, complete documentation, and successful completion of all acceptance tests.


## 7. Validation Process

This process ensures that the defined scope accurately reflects stakeholder needs and expectations.

**Review Activities:**

* **Stakeholder Workshops:**  Conduct workshops to present the scope statement to key stakeholders, allowing for feedback and discussion.
* **Expert Reviews:**  Seek expert opinions on the completeness, accuracy, and feasibility of the scope statement.
* **Requirements Traceability:**  Ensure that all requirements are addressed within the defined scope, establishing clear traceability between requirements and deliverables.
* **Impact Assessment:**  Assess the potential impact of scope changes on project schedule, budget, and resources.

**Approval Workflow:**

1. **Technical Review:**  The development team reviews the scope statement for technical feasibility and completeness.
2. **Business Validation:**  Business users validate that the scope meets their needs and aligns with business objectives.
3. **Sponsor Approval:**  The project sponsor formally approves the scope statement.
4. **Baseline Establishment:**  The approved scope statement is formally established as the project baseline.  A change control process will be implemented to manage any future scope changes.


This detailed Define Scope process, tailored to the unique characteristics of the ADPA project, will ensure a clear, well-defined, and achievable project scope, maximizing the likelihood of project success.
