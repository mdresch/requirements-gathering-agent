# Define Scope Process: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) Project

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, outlining the project's objectives, deliverables, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.  The RGA project aims to develop a revolutionary AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  This tool will significantly improve project management efficiency by automating document creation and ensuring adherence to industry best practices.  A key differentiator is the support for multiple AI providers, offering flexibility and resilience.  However, this initial phase explicitly excludes advanced security features and regulatory compliance beyond basic data integrity.

## 2. Process Overview

This Define Scope process follows a phased approach:

**Phase 1: Requirements Consolidation and Analysis:**  This phase involves a thorough review of existing requirements documentation (including `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, and other relevant documents) to synthesize a comprehensive and unambiguous set of functional and non-functional requirements.

**Phase 2: Scope Statement Development:** A formal project scope statement will be drafted, clearly defining what is included and excluded from the project. This statement will serve as the baseline for all future project decisions.

**Phase 3: Stakeholder Review and Validation:** The draft scope statement will be reviewed and validated by key stakeholders (Development Team, Product Owner, Architecture Team, and Testing Team) to ensure alignment with project goals and feasibility.

**Phase 4: Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:**  Upon stakeholder approval, the scope statement will be formally approved and established as the project baseline.  Any future changes will require a formal change request process.


## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* Project Charter (implied from provided context)
* `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`
* `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`
* `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`
* `ARCHITECTURE.MD`
* Relevant sections from `BABOK-ENTERPRISE-DEMONSTRATION-GUIDE.MD` and `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE-PROVIDER-CHOICE-MENU.MD`
* Stakeholder input gathered during workshops and reviews.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** To map requirements to deliverables and ensure completeness.
* **Facilitated Workshops:** To gather stakeholder input and resolve ambiguities.
* **Prototyping:** To validate the feasibility of key functional aspects.
* **Decision Matrix:** To prioritize features and manage trade-offs. (Example provided in `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`)


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**4.1 Requirements Analysis:** This will involve a detailed analysis of functional and non-functional requirements, focusing on:

* **Functional Requirements:**  Generating PMBOK-compliant documents (Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, etc.), supporting multiple AI providers, providing a CLI interface, template-based document creation, and simple file output management.  Specific document types and templates will be defined.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**  Performance (document generation speed), usability (CLI simplicity), maintainability (clean, modular code), extensibility (plugin architecture).  Specific performance targets will be established.
* **Explicit Exclusions:**  Security classifications, audit trail logging, compliance headers, regulatory metadata, and enterprise security features are explicitly out of scope for this initial release (as stated in `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`).  This will be revisited in future project phases.


**4.2 Scope Boundaries:**

* **Inclusions:**  The development of a functional RGA tool capable of generating PMBOK-compliant documents based on user input and selected AI provider.  This includes the CLI interface, core AI provider integrations (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), and basic template management.
* **Exclusions:**  Advanced security features (authentication beyond API keys, authorization, access control), integration with enterprise systems (SharePoint, Confluence - addressed in separate integration projects), comprehensive audit logging, and regulatory compliance beyond basic data validation.  These features are explicitly deferred to future releases.


## 5. Project Scope Statement

**5.1 Product Scope Description:** The RGA will be a command-line tool capable of generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI.  The tool will support multiple AI providers, offer template-based document creation, and provide basic file output management.

**5.2 Project Deliverables:**

* Functional RGA application with CLI interface.
* Core AI provider integrations (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* Basic template management system.
* User documentation and tutorials.
* Unit and integration tests.

**5.3 Acceptance Criteria:**  The RGA will be considered complete when it successfully generates accurate and complete PMBOK-compliant documents according to predefined templates, meets defined performance targets, and passes all unit and integration tests.

**5.4 Project Constraints:** The project is constrained by the available resources (budget, personnel, and time).

**5.5 Assumptions:**  The availability of stable and reliable AI provider APIs is assumed.

**5.6 Project Exclusions:** As detailed in section 4.2.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

This section will detail each deliverable with specific acceptance criteria.  This will be expanded upon in subsequent documentation.


## 7. Validation Process

The scope will be validated through a series of reviews and approvals:

1. **Technical Review:** The development team will review the scope statement for technical feasibility and completeness.
2. **Stakeholder Review:**  A workshop will be held with stakeholders to review and validate the scope.
3. **Management Approval:** The project sponsor will formally approve the scope statement.
4. **Baseline Establishment:** The approved scope statement will be formally documented and established as the project baseline.


This Define Scope document serves as a living document and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to the scope will be managed through a formal change control process.
