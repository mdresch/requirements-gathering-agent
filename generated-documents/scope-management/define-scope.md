# Define Scope Process  
**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.4

---

## 1. Introduction

The Define Scope process for ADPA establishes a comprehensive and standards-aligned description of the project and product scope. This process ensures that all stakeholders share a unified understanding of what ADPA will deliver—including its enterprise automation features, AI integrations, compliance requirements, and documentation capabilities—forming the foundation for effective project planning, execution, and control.

---

## 2. Process Overview

### Key Objectives

- **Develop a detailed project scope statement** for ADPA, reflecting compliance with BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK frameworks.
- **Define clear project boundaries and exclusions**, especially regarding framework coverage and integration limits.
- **Establish robust acceptance criteria** for modular deliverables, automation pipelines, and integration milestones.
- **Create the scope baseline** supporting enterprise deployment, security, and compliance.

### Process Flow

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Elicit and analyze requirements from enterprise standards, stakeholders, and regulatory bodies.
2. **Scope Statement Development:** Consolidate and document scope elements, leveraging industry best practices.
3. **Stakeholder Validation:** Review scope with business analysts, compliance officers, architects, and enterprise partners.
4. **Scope Approval and Baseline:** Secure formal approval and establish the scope baseline for change control.

## 3. Inputs and Tools

### Primary Inputs

- **Project Charter:** High-level vision, objectives, and constraints for ADPA.
- **Requirements Documentation:** Detailed functional/non-functional requirements, including compliance and integration needs.
- **Stakeholder Register:** Full mapping of internal and external stakeholders, including enterprise partners and AI providers.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** Organizational policies, technology stacks (Node.js, TypeScript), and regulatory frameworks.

### Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment:** Leverage domain experts in business analysis, project management, and data governance.
- **Product Analysis:** Decompose ADPA’s modular architecture to identify scope elements and limitations.
- **Alternative Identification:** Evaluate and select among AI providers, integration scenarios, and deployment models.
- **Facilitated Workshops:** Conduct workshops with cross-functional teams to resolve ambiguities and validate scope boundaries.

  - Integration with Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, and version control

- **Non-Functional Requirements Analysis:**  
  - Security (Entra ID, OAuth2, RBAC, MFA, audit logging)
  - Scalability (microservices, horizontal scaling, caching)
  - Performance and reliability (monitoring, failover, high availability)

- **Business Rules Identification:**  
  - Enterprise compliance mandates (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III, etc.)
  - Automated workflow triggers and approvals

- **Constraint Analysis:**  
  - Supported technology stack (Node.js ≥18, TypeScript ≥5.7)
  - Current framework coverage (DMBOK in progress, others production-ready)
  - Limitations on containerization and mobile support (roadmap items)

### Scope Boundaries

- **Included in Scope:**  
  - Modular framework for document generation
  - Implementation of BABOK v3, PMBOK 7, and DMBOK 2.0 (core artifacts)
  - REST API (TypeSpec/OpenAPI), CLI, and web admin portal
  - Integration with selected enterprise platforms
  - Security and compliance features for Fortune 500 readiness

- **Explicitly Excluded:**  
  - Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes templates in future releases)
  - Mobile application support (Q3 2025+)
  - Real-time collaboration and advanced analytics dashboard (roadmap)
  - Frameworks beyond BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK unless specified in roadmap

- **Interface Definitions:**  
  - API endpoints (OpenAPI 3.0, Swagger UI)
  - CLI commands (Yargs-based)
  - Integration touchpoints (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, VCS)

- **Dependencies Identification:**  
  - Third-party AI providers (OpenAI, Google, GitHub, Ollama)
  - Identity and access management systems
  - Enterprise document repositories
