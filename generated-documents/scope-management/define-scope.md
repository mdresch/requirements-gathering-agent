# Define Scope Process: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA) Project

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  This process establishes a clear and concise description of the project's scope, ensuring alignment with the project charter and stakeholder expectations.  The unique aspect of this project is its self-authorization via AI-driven strategic inception, requiring a scope definition process that accounts for this innovative approach.

## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Define the project's boundaries, both in terms of functionality and deliverables.
* Explicitly identify what is included (in-scope) and excluded (out-of-scope) from the project.
* Establish clear and measurable acceptance criteria for all deliverables.
* Create a formal project scope statement serving as the baseline for future scope control.
* Account for the project's unique self-authorization process via AI.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Initial Scope Review:** Analyze the existing project charter, README, and generated documents (Business Case, Stakeholder Register, etc.) to establish a preliminary scope.
2. **Requirements Elicitation:**  Refine the initial scope through analysis of user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, and feedback from key stakeholders (including the AI system itself, considering its role in project inception).
3. **Scope Definition:** Develop a detailed project scope statement, explicitly defining deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, constraints, and exclusions.  This includes defining the scope of the AI's role in ongoing document generation and maintenance.
4. **Stakeholder Validation:**  Present the scope statement to stakeholders for review and approval.  Address any concerns or ambiguities.
5. **Scope Baseline Establishment:**  Formalize the approved scope statement as the project's scope baseline. This baseline will be used to manage changes throughout the project lifecycle.


## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* **Project Charter:** The formal authorization document initiating the ADPA project. This includes high-level objectives and constraints.
* **README.md & Project Documentation:** The comprehensive project documentation detailing features, functionality, and design.
* **Generated Documents:** AI-generated documents like the Business Case, Stakeholder Register, and initial Project Scope Statement provide valuable insights.
* **Stakeholder Register:** Identifies key stakeholders and their expectations.
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** Relevant organizational policies, standards, and regulations.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment:** Leveraging the expertise of project managers, developers, and AI specialists.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** Mapping requirements to deliverables to ensure comprehensive coverage.
* **Prototyping:** Developing prototypes of key features to validate design and functionality.
* **Workshops and Meetings:** Facilitated sessions with stakeholders to discuss and refine the scope.
* **AI-Assisted Analysis:** Utilizing the AI capabilities of ADPA to analyze project documentation and identify potential scope gaps or inconsistencies.


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:**

* **Functional Requirements:**  Analyze the README and other project documentation to identify the core functionalities of ADPA, including document generation types, AI provider support, CLI functionality, and validation capabilities.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Define performance, security, scalability, and maintainability requirements.
* **Business Rules:**  Establish rules governing document generation, AI interaction, and data handling.
* **Constraints:** Identify resource limitations (budget, time, personnel) and technical constraints.

**Scope Boundaries:**

* **In-Scope:**  Specifically define the features and deliverables included in the ADPA project. This includes, but isn't limited to, the generation of specific PMBOK documents, support for multiple AI providers, CLI functionality, and the ongoing maintenance of the AI-driven generation process.
* **Out-of-Scope:** Explicitly list features or functionalities that are not included in the project.  This might include integration with specific third-party tools, advanced AI functionalities beyond the current scope, or support for non-markdown document formats.
* **Interfaces:** Define how ADPA interacts with other systems or tools.
* **Dependencies:** Identify any external dependencies or integrations required.


## 5. Project Scope Statement

The Project Scope Statement will be a formal document encompassing the following:

* **Project Goals and Objectives:** A clear statement of what the project aims to achieve.
* **Product Scope Description:** A detailed description of the ADPA tool, its functionalities, and its intended use.
* **Project Deliverables:** A comprehensive list of all project outputs, including documentation, code, and test artifacts.
* **Acceptance Criteria:** Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria for accepting each deliverable.
* **Project Constraints:**  Limitations on resources, time, budget, or technology.
* **Assumptions:**  Statements about factors that are assumed to be true during project execution.
* **Project Exclusions:** A clear listing of what is explicitly excluded from the project.
* **AI System Role Definition:**  A specific description of the AI's role in the project, including its contribution to scope definition, document generation, and ongoing maintenance.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

This section will detail the deliverables, categorized by functionality and type, including specific versions, acceptance criteria, and testing procedures.  This will include both code deliverables and documentation.


## 7. Validation Process

**Review Activities:**

* **Formal Reviews:**  Regular reviews of the scope statement by stakeholders and project team members to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* **Requirements Traceability:**  Verifying that all requirements are addressed in the scope statement and linked to specific deliverables.
* **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluating the impact of any proposed scope changes.

**Approval Workflow:**

1. **Technical Review:**  Review by the development team to ensure technical feasibility and alignment with the design.
2. **Business Validation:**  Review by stakeholders to ensure alignment with business needs and objectives.
3. **Sponsor Approval:**  Formal approval by the project sponsor.
4. **Baseline Establishment:**  The approved scope statement is formally baselined and becomes the basis for project execution and change management.


This Define Scope process, tailored to the unique context of the ADPA project, ensures a robust foundation for successful project execution.  The iterative nature of the process, coupled with the integration of AI-driven insights, will optimize the definition and management of the project scope.
