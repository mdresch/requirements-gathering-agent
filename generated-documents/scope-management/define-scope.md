# Define Scope Process  
**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

---

## 1. Introduction

The Define Scope process for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework establishes a comprehensive and detailed description of both the project and product scope. This document forms the foundation for all subsequent project planning, execution, and control activities. Given ADPA’s positioning as an enterprise-ready, standards-compliant automation platform, scope definition is critical to align diverse stakeholder expectations, ensure regulatory compliance, and support robust, scalable solution delivery.

---

## 2. Process Overview

### Key Objectives

- Develop a detailed project scope statement tailored to ADPA’s enterprise automation goals.
- Define clear project boundaries, inclusions, and exclusions for all supported standards and integrations.
- Establish acceptance criteria for deliverables, reflecting compliance, security, and performance requirements.
- Create a scope baseline serving as the reference for change control and project validation.

### Process Flow

1. **Requirements Analysis:** Elicit, analyze, and consolidate functional/non-functional requirements from enterprise users, regulatory mandates, and industry best practices (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
2. **Scope Statement Development:** Draft and iterate on the project scope statement, ensuring coverage of all frameworks, integrations, and compliance features.
3. **Stakeholder Validation:** Engage business analysts, project managers, compliance officers, and technical architects for feedback.
4. **Scope Approval and Baseline:** Secure formal approval from project sponsors and key stakeholders, establishing the definitive scope baseline.

## 3. Inputs and Tools

### Primary Inputs

- **Project Charter:** Outlines high-level objectives, justification, and initial boundaries for ADPA.
- **Requirements Documentation:** Includes functional requirements (e.g., standards compliance automation, AI provider support), non-functional requirements (e.g., security, scalability), and integration needs.
- **Stakeholder Register:** Identifies internal and external stakeholders including enterprise IT, compliance, business analysts, and end-users.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** Considers organizational standards, regulatory obligations (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.), existing IT infrastructure, and deployment models.

### Tools and Techniques

- **Expert Judgment:** Leverage subject matter experts in enterprise automation, AI, security, and standards compliance.
- **Product Analysis:** Decompose ADPA’s modular architecture, feature set, and integration points.
- **Alternative Identification:** Evaluate implementation approaches (e.g., REST API vs. CLI, different AI providers, multi-cloud strategies).
- **Facilitated Workshops:** Conduct collaborative sessions with business and technical stakeholders for scope clarification and consensus.

## 8. Practical Guidance for ADPA Scope Management

- **Leverage Standards:**  
  Use the included BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 frameworks as scope anchors to minimize ambiguity.
- **Modular Approach:**  
  Prioritize modularity in scope definition—each integration and feature should be independently testable and deliverable.
- **Continuous Validation:**  
  Integrate frequent reviews and demos throughout development to ensure ongoing alignment with evolving enterprise needs.
- **Change Control:**  
  All scope changes must follow the formal change control process to protect project integrity and timeline.
- **Documentation First:**  
  Treat all documentation, from API specs to user guides, as core deliverables with acceptance criteria.
