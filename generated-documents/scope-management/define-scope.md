# Define Scope Process: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This project aims to revolutionize enterprise business analysis by automating the generation of BABOK v3 compliant frameworks using AI.  The unique aspect of this project lies in its speed, accuracy, and ability to produce Fortune 500-grade deliverables, significantly reducing time and effort compared to traditional methods.  This scope definition ensures alignment across stakeholders and provides a clear baseline for project execution.


## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Define the project's deliverables precisely, including the scope of the API, generated documents, and supporting materials.
* Clearly delineate project boundaries, specifying what features are included and excluded.
* Establish comprehensive acceptance criteria for the API and generated documents, ensuring quality and compliance.
* Create a robust scope baseline to manage changes effectively throughout the project lifecycle.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Requirements Analysis:**  Review existing documentation (provided project README,  `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, etc.) to consolidate and refine functional and non-functional requirements.  This includes analyzing the needs for different document types (BABOK, PMBOK, etc.), API functionality (generation, template management, etc.), and integration with various AI providers.

2. **Scope Statement Development:**  Develop a comprehensive scope statement based on the refined requirements, addressing product scope, project deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, assumptions, and exclusions.  This will leverage the existing documentation and incorporate details from the `API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD` and `ARCHITECTURE.MD` documents to ensure alignment between the API's functionality and the generated documents.

3. **Stakeholder Validation:**  Present the draft scope statement to key stakeholders (development team, product owner, architecture team, testing team) for review and feedback.  Address any concerns or ambiguities and iterate on the scope statement as needed.  This phase will actively use the information and consensus described in `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`.

4. **Scope Approval and Baseline:** Obtain formal approval from project sponsors and stakeholders on the finalized scope statement. This approved document establishes the project scope baseline.


## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* Project Charter (implied from the provided README)
* Requirements Documentation (`02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, etc.)
* Stakeholder Register (implied from README and other documents)
* Enterprise Environmental Factors (implied context: Fortune 500 validation, regulatory compliance needs)
* API Specifications (`api-specs/`)
* Existing Documentation (all `.md` files in the `docs/` directory)


**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment:** Leverage the expertise of the development team and business analysts to refine requirements and define the scope.
* **Product Analysis:** Analyze the existing system architecture and functionality to inform scope decisions.
* **Alternative Identification:** Explore alternative approaches to document generation and API design to optimize the solution.
* **Facilitated Workshops:** Conduct workshops with stakeholders to ensure alignment and address concerns.
* **Prototyping:**  Develop prototypes of key features to validate design decisions and gather feedback.


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:**  This will involve a detailed review of all provided documentation to identify:

* **Functional Requirements:**  Specific functionalities of the API (document generation, template management, job management, authentication, etc.) and the generated documents (BABOK framework structure, content completeness, compliance, etc.).
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Performance criteria (generation speed, API response times), security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection), scalability, maintainability, and usability.
* **Business Rules:** Constraints and rules governing the generation process (e.g.,  BABOK v3 compliance rules, data validation rules).
* **Constraints:**  Technical limitations, budgetary constraints, time constraints, and regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOX).

**Scope Boundaries:**

* **Inclusions:**  Specifically define the features of the API and the types of documents generated (BABOK, PMBOK â€“ clarifying if PMBOK is in scope).  This will clearly state the supported AI providers and their integration details.
* **Exclusions:**  Explicitly state what is *not* included (e.g., specific integrations with third-party tools not explicitly mentioned, support for future versions of BABOK beyond v3, etc.).
* **Interfaces:** Define the API interfaces (endpoints, request/response formats) and the interaction with external systems (AI providers).
* **Dependencies:** Identify dependencies on external libraries, services, and infrastructure.


## 5. Project Scope Statement (Example Structure)

This section would contain a formal, approved document detailing the following:

* **Product Scope Description:** A concise description of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent and its capabilities.
* **Project Deliverables:**  List of all deliverables, including the production-ready API, documentation (user manuals, API specifications), and sample generated documents.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific criteria for accepting each deliverable (e.g., API performance benchmarks, document content completeness, BABOK compliance verification).
* **Project Constraints:**  Limitations on resources, time, budget, technology, and regulatory compliance.
* **Assumptions:**  Underlying assumptions made during scope definition (e.g., availability of AI provider APIs, stakeholder availability for validation).
* **Project Exclusions:**  Clearly stated items not included in the project scope.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

This section will provide a detailed breakdown of deliverables, including their format, content, and acceptance criteria.  It will specify the deliverables for both the API and the generated documents.


## 7. Validation Process

This section will outline the formal review and approval process, including:

* **Technical Review:** Verification of API functionality, performance, and security by the development team.
* **Business Validation:**  Assessment of the generated documents' usefulness and accuracy by business analysts and stakeholders.
* **Sponsor Approval:** Formal sign-off from project sponsors to confirm acceptance of the defined scope.
* **Baseline Establishment:**  The approved scope statement becomes the project's baseline, with a formal change management process for any future modifications.


This comprehensive Define Scope document provides a solid foundation for the successful execution of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The iterative approach to stakeholder validation and the detailed definition of deliverables and acceptance criteria ensure clarity, minimize risks, and maximize the chances of delivering a high-quality, impactful product.
