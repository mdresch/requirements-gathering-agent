# Define Scope Process: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## 1. Introduction

This Define Scope process establishes a detailed description of the ADPA project and product scope, creating a foundation for all subsequent project work and decision-making.  The process emphasizes the unique aspects of ADPA, including its AI-driven capabilities,  PMBOK 7.0 compliance, and the generation of both technical design and strategic business documents.

## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Develop a detailed project scope statement encompassing both functional and non-functional requirements.
* Define clear project boundaries and explicitly list exclusions to prevent scope creep.
* Establish comprehensive acceptance criteria aligned with PMBOK 7.0 standards and executive expectations.
* Create a robust scope baseline to manage changes effectively throughout the project lifecycle.
* Account for the unique challenges and opportunities presented by an AI-driven project.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Requirements Analysis:**  Analyze existing documentation (README, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md`, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`, etc.) to identify functional and non-functional requirements.  Prioritize requirements based on business value and feasibility.
2. **Scope Statement Development:**  Develop a detailed project scope statement incorporating the prioritized requirements, defining deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, assumptions, and exclusions.  This statement should address both the generation of PMBOK-compliant documents and the development of the core AI engine.
3. **Stakeholder Validation:**  Present the draft scope statement to key stakeholders (development team, product owner, architecture team, testing team) for review and feedback.  Address any concerns or ambiguities.
4. **Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:**  Obtain formal approval of the scope statement from project sponsors and stakeholders.  Establish the approved scope statement as the project baseline.  This baseline will be formally managed and updated through a change management process.
5. **Technical Design Specification Incorporation:**  Integrate the detailed technical design specifications (outlined in `ARCHITECTURE.MD` and associated documents) into the scope statement. This will ensure alignment between the high-level project goals and the technical implementation.
6. **Strategic Document Generation Scope Definition:** Clearly define the scope of strategic document generation, including but not limited to company values, purpose statements, and other executive-level communications.  This should involve defining the level of AI-driven synthesis required and the quality standards for the output.


## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* **Project Charter:** The initial project charter that authorized ADPA's existence.
* **Requirements Documentation:**  All available project documentation, including the README,  `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md`, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md`,  and other relevant files identified through the enhanced project analysis feature.
* **Stakeholder Register:**  A comprehensive list of stakeholders and their expectations, implicitly and explicitly defined across the project documents.
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors:**  Organizational policies, standards, and constraints relevant to the project.  This includes considerations for compliance and integration with existing systems (SharePoint, Confluence, etc.).
* **Technical Design Documents:** The comprehensive set of technical design documents generated by ADPA itself. This is a unique input reflecting the self-documenting nature of the project.

**Tools and Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment:**  Leverage the expertise of the development team and stakeholders to refine the scope and address technical challenges.
* **Product Analysis:**  Analyze existing project documentation and the capabilities of ADPA to define realistic deliverables.
* **Alternative Identification:**  Explore alternative approaches to generating documentation and achieving project objectives.
* **Facilitated Workshops:**  Conduct workshops with stakeholders to ensure consensus on the project scope.
* **Enhanced Project Analysis:** Employ ADPA's built-in project analysis capabilities to identify and prioritize relevant documents for scope definition.


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:**

* **Functional Requirements:**  Analyze requirements for generating PMBOK documents, supporting multiple AI providers, utilizing a CLI, handling large context models, and integrating with various platforms (SharePoint, etc.).  This includes the new technical design document generation capabilities.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** Analyze requirements for performance, scalability, maintainability, security (where applicable), usability, and compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Business Rules Identification:**  Define any business rules governing document generation, formatting, and content.
* **Constraint Analysis:**  Identify and document any constraints, such as time limitations, budget restrictions, and technology limitations.


**Scope Boundaries:**

* **Inclusions:**  Clearly define all features and functionalities to be included in ADPA, including the generation of all PMBOK documents, the technical design document suite, and the strategic business communication features.
* **Exclusions:** Explicitly list features or functionalities that are *not* included in the current scope.  Examples might include specific integrations with third-party tools not yet supported, advanced security features, or specific regulatory compliance beyond PMBOK.
* **Interface Definitions:** Define how ADPA interacts with external systems, such as AI providers and document repositories.
* **Dependencies Identification:**  Identify any dependencies on external tools or services.


## 5. Project Scope Statement (Example Structure)

This section should be a comprehensive document, produced as an output of the process above.  It would include the following sections:

* **1. Introduction:** A brief overview of the project and its purpose.
* **2. Project Objectives:** A clear statement of the project's goals and expected outcomes.
* **3. Product Scope Description:** A detailed description of the ADPA software, including its features and functionalities.  This should cover both PMBOK document generation and the technical design document system.
* **4. Project Deliverables:** A list of all deliverables, including specific document types, software components, and documentation.
* **5. Acceptance Criteria:**  Clearly defined criteria for accepting each deliverable, aligned with PMBOK 7.0 and stakeholder expectations. This would include quality metrics, functional tests, and compliance checks.
* **6. Project Constraints:**  Any limitations on time, resources, budget, or technology.
* **7. Assumptions:**  Any assumptions made during scope definition that could affect the project.
* **8. Project Exclusions:**  A clear list of features or functionalities that are explicitly *not* included in the project scope.
* **9. Stakeholder Sign-off:**  Space for stakeholders to formally approve the scope statement.


## 6. Deliverables Framework

This section would elaborate on the deliverables listed in the Project Scope Statement, providing more detail on each.

## 7. Validation Process

This section would outline the process for reviewing and approving the scope statement, including stakeholder workshops, formal reviews, and sign-off procedures.  It should specify the roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the validation process.  This section should also include a detailed Change Management Process outlining how future changes to the scope will be managed.


This detailed Define Scope process ensures that the ADPA project is well-defined, managed, and aligned with stakeholder expectations and PMBOK best practices.  The iterative nature of the process, incorporating feedback and incorporating the unique aspects of the project, ensures a high degree of clarity and success.
