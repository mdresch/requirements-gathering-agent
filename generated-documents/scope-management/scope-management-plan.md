## Scope Management Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th edition standards and aims to ensure that the project delivers the intended functionality and value while effectively managing changes and controlling costs.  The plan addresses scope planning, definition, verification, and control.

**2. Scope Management Methodology**

The project will utilize an iterative and incremental approach to scope management. This approach allows for flexibility in responding to changing requirements and incorporates continuous feedback from stakeholders.  The core principles of this methodology are:

* **Iterative Development:**  The project will be broken down into manageable iterations, with scope defined and delivered incrementally. This allows for early feedback and adaptation.
* **Stakeholder Collaboration:**  Active and continuous engagement with stakeholders will be crucial for refining scope and ensuring alignment.
* **Formal Documentation:**  All scope-related decisions, changes, and approvals will be formally documented and tracked.
* **Change Control:** A robust change control process will be implemented to manage and approve scope changes effectively.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:**  All scope management activities will align with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) 7th edition guidelines.


**3. Scope Planning**

**3.1 Scope Planning Process:**

This phase involves defining how the project scope will be managed.  Key activities include:

* **Requirements Gathering:**  Analyzing the project's existing README, documentation (including those automatically generated by ADPA itself), and stakeholder input to identify all functionalities and features.  The existing README's "Features" section provides an excellent starting point.  Additional requirements will be elicited through stakeholder interviews and workshops.
* **Scope Definition:**  Creating a detailed Project Scope Statement that clearly defines the project boundaries, deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and constraints.  This will leverage the existing `ProjectScopeStatement.md` as a foundation, refining and extending it based on further stakeholder input.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Development:**  Decomposing the project scope into smaller, manageable work packages.  The existing project structure and the README's "Generated Documents" section will be used as a basis for the initial WBS.
* **Scope Baseline Establishment:**  Formally documenting the approved scope, WBS, and WBS dictionary to establish a baseline against which future changes will be measured.
* **Resource Planning:**  Estimating the resources (time, cost, personnel) required for each work package.


**3.2 Scope Planning Inputs:**

* The project's README file.
* Existing project documentation (e.g., `BusinessCase.md`, `StakeholderRegister.md`, `ProjectScopeStatement.md`).
* Stakeholder input gathered through interviews and workshops.
* PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.
* Organizational process assets.


**3.3 Scope Planning Outputs:**

* Project Scope Statement (formal document).
* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
* WBS Dictionary.
* Scope Baseline.
* Resource estimates.
* Scope Management Plan (this document).


**4. Scope Definition**

**4.1 Scope Definition Process:**

This phase involves creating a precise description of the project's scope.

* **Develop Project Scope Statement:**  A formal document clearly defining what is included and excluded from the project. This will build upon the existing `ProjectScopeStatement.md` file.  Specific attention will be paid to defining acceptance criteria for each deliverable.
* **Create WBS and WBS Dictionary:**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into manageable work packages, along with detailed descriptions for each work package.
* **Define Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria for accepting each deliverable.


**4.2 Scope Definition Inputs:**

* Outputs from the Scope Planning phase.
* Stakeholder feedback.
* Expert judgment.


**4.3 Scope Definition Outputs:**

* Detailed Project Scope Statement.
* Approved WBS and WBS Dictionary.
* Defined Acceptance Criteria for each deliverable.


**5. Scope Verification**

**5.1 Scope Verification Process:**

This phase involves formally accepting the project deliverables.

* **Inspection and Testing:**  Rigorous testing of each deliverable against its defined acceptance criteria. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
* **Formal Acceptance:**  Obtaining formal sign-off from stakeholders confirming that the deliverables meet their requirements.


**5.2 Scope Verification Inputs:**

* Completed deliverables.
* Acceptance criteria.
* Test results.
* Stakeholder feedback.


**5.3 Scope Verification Outputs:**

* Verified and accepted deliverables.
* Sign-off documentation from stakeholders.
* Lessons learned documentation.


**6. Scope Control**

**6.1 Scope Control Process:**

This phase manages changes to the project scope.

* **Change Request Management:**  A formal process for submitting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes to the project scope. This includes assessing the impact of changes on the schedule, budget, and resources.
* **Scope Change Control Board (CCB):**  A designated group responsible for reviewing and approving/rejecting change requests.  The CCB will consist of key stakeholders, including the project sponsor, project manager, and representatives from relevant departments.
* **Scope Baseline Updates:**  Updating the project scope baseline to reflect approved changes.
* **Monitor and Control Scope:**  Tracking scope performance, identifying variances, and taking corrective actions.


**6.2 Scope Control Inputs:**

* Change requests.
* Performance reports.
* Stakeholder feedback.
* Project management plan updates.


**6.3 Scope Control Outputs:**

* Approved change requests.
* Updated project scope baseline.
* Corrective actions.
* Updated project schedule and budget.


**7.  Tools and Techniques**

* **Software:** Project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana, Microsoft Project) for tracking tasks, managing changes, and generating reports.
* **Documentation:**  Version control system (Git) for tracking changes to project documents.  The built-in VCS within ADPA will be utilized.
* **Communication:**  Regular meetings, email, and other communication tools to keep stakeholders informed.


**8.  Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:**  Overall responsibility for scope management.
* **Business Analyst:**  Responsible for requirements gathering and analysis.
* **Development Team:**  Responsible for delivering the project deliverables.
* **Testing Team:**  Responsible for verifying the deliverables.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):**  Responsible for approving/rejecting change requests.


**9.  Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete when all deliverables have been successfully verified and accepted by the stakeholders, as defined in the Project Scope Statement and documented acceptance criteria.  This includes satisfactory completion of all testing phases (unit, integration, system, and UAT).


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to ensure it remains relevant and effective.  The plan will be dynamically adjusted based on lessons learned and stakeholder feedback.
