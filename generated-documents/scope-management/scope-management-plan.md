## Scope Management Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th edition standards and leverages the project's existing documentation, particularly the comprehensive README.md file and associated markdown documents, as key inputs.  The plan details how scope will be planned, defined, verified, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Scope Management Processes**

The ADPA project will utilize the following scope management processes:

* **2.1 Planning Scope Management:** This process involves defining how the project scope will be managed. This will be achieved by leveraging the existing project documentation (README, Business Case, Project Charter, etc.) to establish a baseline scope.  The plan will define roles and responsibilities, methodologies, and tools for effective scope management.

* **2.2 Collecting Requirements:** This process focuses on determining, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs and requirements.  The ADPA project already has a robust requirements gathering process in place, as evidenced by the detailed README.md and associated documentation. This existing documentation will be the primary input, supplemented by feedback from the user community (via GitHub issues and discussions).

* **2.3 Defining Scope:**  This process involves developing a detailed project scope statement that clearly defines the project boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  The existing Project Scope Statement (`generated-documents/scope-management/project-scope-statement.md`) will be the starting point.  This statement will be reviewed and updated based on feedback and further requirements identified during the project.

* **2.4 Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  The project will use a WBS to decompose the project scope into smaller, manageable work packages. The WBS will be based on the project's existing structure and will be detailed enough to support accurate estimation and tracking of progress.

* **2.5 Validating Scope:** This process ensures that the project scope accurately reflects stakeholder needs and expectations.  Regular reviews and feedback sessions with the user community will be conducted to validate the scope.

* **2.6 Controlling Scope:** This process manages changes to the project scope throughout the project lifecycle. A formal change control process will be implemented, incorporating change requests, impact assessments, approvals, and documentation.  The existing Version Control System built into the ADPA tool will be leveraged to track changes.


**3. Scope Baseline**

The scope baseline will be established by consolidating the information from the existing project documentation, specifically:

* **Project Charter:** Provides high-level scope and authorization.
* **Project Scope Statement:** Defines the project boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.
* **README.md and associated markdown files:** Detailed description of features, functionality, and technical specifications.

Any discrepancies or ambiguities will be addressed through stakeholder consultation and documented in a revised scope baseline.

**4. Scope Change Control Process**

The following process will be used to manage scope changes:

* **4.1 Change Request Submission:**  Stakeholders submit change requests via GitHub issues, detailing the proposed changes, justifications, and impact assessments.

* **4.2 Change Request Evaluation:** The project team evaluates the change request, assessing its impact on the schedule, budget, and resources.

* **4.3 Change Request Approval:** The Project Manager approves or rejects the change request based on the evaluation. Major changes might require approval from higher management.

* **4.4 Change Implementation:**  Approved changes are implemented, and the scope baseline is updated accordingly.

* **4.5 Change Documentation:** All changes are meticulously documented and tracked using the integrated Version Control System.


**5. Scope Verification and Validation**

* **5.1 Verification:** The project team will regularly verify that the work performed conforms to the scope baseline. This will include reviews of deliverables, code quality checks, and testing.

* **5.2 Validation:**  Formal acceptance testing and stakeholder reviews will be conducted to validate that the deliverables meet the acceptance criteria defined in the scope statement.


**6. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be utilized for scope management:

* **Documentation Management:**  GitHub repository and integrated Version Control System.
* **Communication:** GitHub Issues, Discussions, and regular updates to the project's README.md.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix will be maintained to link requirements to deliverables and test cases.
* **WBS Charting:**  A visual representation of the project's work breakdown will be maintained.
* **Change Management Software (if necessary):**  A dedicated change management system might be implemented for complex or high-volume changes.


**7. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for scope management, change control, and communication.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for delivering the project deliverables according to the defined scope.
* **User Community:**  Provides feedback, identifies requirements, and validates the scope.


**8. Reporting**

Regular reports will be provided to stakeholders, highlighting scope progress, changes, and any identified issues.  These reports will be made available through the project's GitHub repository.


**9.  Scope Management Plan Updates**

This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated at least monthly, or more frequently if significant changes occur.  Updates will be communicated to all stakeholders.


This plan provides a robust framework for managing the scope of the ADPA project.  Its iterative nature and reliance on existing documentation ensure continuous alignment with stakeholder needs and project objectives, supporting the project's successful completion.
