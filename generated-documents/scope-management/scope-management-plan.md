## Scope Management Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project. It adheres to PMBOK 7th edition standards and aims to ensure that all necessary work, and only necessary work, is included within the project, meeting stakeholder expectations and organizational objectives.  This plan will be reviewed and updated at regular intervals (at least monthly, or as needed due to significant changes).

**2.  Scope Management Approach**

A combination of iterative and incremental approaches will be used.  The initial scope will be defined comprehensively, with subsequent iterations focusing on refining existing functionalities and adding new features (as defined in the project roadmap).  This approach allows for flexibility while maintaining control over scope creep.  The project will utilize a formal change control process (detailed in Section 6) to manage any deviations from the baseline scope.

**3. Scope Planning**

**3.1 Scope Planning Process:**

The scope planning process will involve the following activities:

* **Requirements Gathering:**  Leveraging the existing comprehensive README and associated documentation, along with stakeholder input (primarily the development team initially, with potential future expansion to include external stakeholders), the project's functional and non-functional requirements will be clearly defined. This includes prioritizing requirements using a MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).  Existing documents like `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.md` will be reviewed and updated to reflect the final scope.
* **Scope Definition:** A Project Scope Statement will be created, clearly defining the project boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  This document will be derived from the Project Charter, requirements documentation, and stakeholder input.  The existing `ProjectScopeStatement.md` (generated by ADPA itself) will serve as a starting point and will be reviewed and refined.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Development:** A detailed WBS will be developed, decomposing the project into smaller, manageable work packages. The WBS will be organized hierarchically, starting with major deliverables and progressing to individual tasks. The WBS Dictionary will define each WBS element, including responsibilities, time estimates, and dependencies.
* **Scope Baseline Establishment:** Once the Project Scope Statement and WBS are approved, a formal scope baseline will be established. This baseline will serve as the reference point for future scope changes.

**3.2 Scope Planning Inputs:**

* Project Charter (already exists)
* Stakeholder Register (already exists)
* Requirements documentation (existing documentation and refined requirements)
* Organizational Process Assets (PMBOK guidelines, existing templates)
* Enterprise Environmental Factors (available resources, technology constraints)

**3.3 Scope Planning Outputs:**

* Project Scope Statement (refined version of existing document)
* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
* WBS Dictionary
* Scope Baseline
* Requirements Traceability Matrix

**4. Scope Definition**

The scope definition will consist of:

* **Project Objectives:**  Clearly stated objectives derived from the Project Charter and README.  These will focus on the generation of accurate, complete, and PMBOK-compliant documentation.
* **Deliverables:**  A comprehensive list of all deliverables, including all PMBOK documents, technical design documents, and strategic statements as outlined in the README.  Specific versions and formats will be clearly defined.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria for each deliverable will be defined. These criteria will ensure that deliverables meet the project's quality standards and PMBOK compliance requirements.  Existing validation mechanisms within the ADPA tool will be used as a basis.
* **Exclusions:**  Explicitly defined items that are out of scope, such as integration with specific third-party systems not currently listed, or the development of entirely new features beyond those outlined in the roadmap.

**5. Scope Verification and Validation**

* **Verification:** The project team will conduct regular reviews of deliverables against the acceptance criteria. This will involve technical reviews, quality assurance checks, and stakeholder reviews.  Automated validation features within ADPA will be heavily utilized.
* **Validation:**  Formal acceptance will be obtained from stakeholders (initially the development team) for each deliverable. This will involve a sign-off process ensuring that the deliverables meet their expectations.

**6. Scope Change Control**

Any proposed changes to the scope will follow a formal change control process:

* **Change Request Submission:**  Changes must be documented formally using a standardized change request form. The form will include a description of the change, justification, impact analysis (scope, schedule, cost, risk), and proposed solution.
* **Change Evaluation:** The Change Control Board (CCB), consisting of key stakeholders (Project Manager, Development Lead, and relevant subject matter experts), will evaluate the change request.
* **Change Approval/Rejection:** The CCB will approve or reject the change request based on its impact and alignment with project objectives.  Approved changes will be documented and integrated into the scope baseline.
* **Change Implementation:**  Approved changes will be implemented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.  The impact on the project schedule and budget will be carefully monitored.

**7. Scope Control Monitoring and Reporting**

* **Regular Monitoring:** The project manager will monitor progress against the scope baseline, identifying any potential scope creep or issues.
* **Regular Reporting:**  Regular reports (weekly and monthly) will be generated, tracking scope progress, change requests, and any variances from the baseline.  These reports will be distributed to stakeholders.

**8.  Tools and Techniques**

* **Software:**  ADPA (for document generation and validation), Project Management software (for WBS and task management), Version Control System (Git)
* **Techniques:**  MoSCoW prioritization, SMART criteria definition, WBS decomposition, regular meetings and reviews.

**9.  Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for scope management.
* **Development Lead:**  Responsible for technical aspects of scope definition and verification.
* **CCB:**  Responsible for evaluating and approving scope change requests.


This Scope Management Plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the ADPA project.  It will be a living document, regularly reviewed and updated to reflect project progress and changes.  The flexibility built into the iterative approach allows for adaptation while maintaining a strong focus on delivering the core project objectives as defined.
