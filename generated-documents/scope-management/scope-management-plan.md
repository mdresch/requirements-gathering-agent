## Scope Management Plan: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of Project Backup Vermigerous.  The project aims to automate the monthly backup process, ensuring sufficient and readily restorable backups in case of system failure, categorized by year and month. This plan adheres to PMBOK Guide 7th Edition standards.

**2. Project Scope Statement**

**2.1 Project Objectives:**

* Automate the monthly backup process for Project Backup Vermigerous.
* Implement incremental or differential backups to optimize storage and time.
* Ensure data integrity through automated validation and checksum verification.
* Securely store backups using immutable storage with encryption (at rest and in transit).
* Implement automated recovery testing in a sandbox environment.
* Establish monitoring and alerting for backup failures and storage thresholds.
* Categorize backups by year and month for easy retrieval.

**2.2 Project Deliverables:**

* Automated backup script (e.g., PowerShell, Azure Automation).
* Secure storage infrastructure (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM).
* Automated validation and checksum generation script.
* Automated recovery test script and procedures.
* Monitoring and alerting system integration (e.g., Azure Monitor).
* Documentation including user guides, technical specifications, and test results.

**2.3 Project Exclusions:**

* Development of new applications whose data needs backing up. This plan focuses solely on the backup *process* improvement.
* Hardware procurement. The project assumes existing hardware sufficient for backup operations.
*  Integration with non-specified systems.  Only current systems requiring backup are in scope.
* Ongoing maintenance beyond initial implementation and testing.

**3. Scope Planning**

**3.1 Scope Definition:** The detailed definition of all project deliverables, as outlined in section 2.2, will be documented in a Requirements Specification document. This will include functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and dependencies.  The project scope baseline will be established upon approval of this Requirements Specification document.

**3.2 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A WBS will be created to decompose the project into manageable work packages.  Example WBS structure:

* 1.0 Project Management
    * 1.1 Planning
    * 1.2 Execution
    * 1.3 Monitoring & Controlling
    * 1.4 Closure
* 2.0 Backup Automation
    * 2.1 Script Development
    * 2.2 Testing & Validation
    * 2.3 Deployment
* 3.0 Secure Storage
    * 3.1 Infrastructure Setup
    * 3.2 Security Configuration
* 4.0 Data Validation
    * 4.1 Checksum Implementation
    * 4.2 Validation Script Development
* 5.0 Recovery Testing
    * 5.1 Sandbox Environment Setup
    * 5.2 Test Script Development
* 6.0 Monitoring & Alerting
    * 6.1 System Integration
    * 6.2 Alert Configuration
* 7.0 Documentation
    * 7.1 User Guide
    * 7.2 Technical Documentation


**3.3 Requirements Traceability Matrix:** A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) will be used to link requirements to deliverables and test cases, ensuring complete coverage and facilitating change management.

**4. Scope Definition**

The project scope will be formally defined in a Requirements Specification document, detailing all functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and assumptions. This document will be reviewed and approved by all relevant stakeholders.

**5. Scope Verification**

**5.1 Verification Process:** Verification will be conducted throughout the project lifecycle, including:

* **Unit Testing:** Each component (script, infrastructure element) will be tested individually.
* **Integration Testing:**  Testing the interaction between different components.
* **System Testing:** Testing the entire backup system as a whole.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by end-users to ensure the system meets their needs.
* **Recovery Testing:** Testing the restoration process in the sandbox environment.

**5.2 Acceptance Criteria:** Each deliverable will have specific acceptance criteria defined in the Requirements Specification document.  For example:

* Backup script must complete successfully within [X] minutes.
* Backups must be encrypted using AES-256.
* Recovery testing must show successful restoration of data within [Y] minutes.
* All alerts must function correctly.


**6. Scope Control**

**6.1 Change Control Process:** A formal change control process will be implemented to manage any changes to the project scope. This process will include:

* **Change Request Submission:**  Formal requests for changes must be documented, including impact assessments.
* **Change Evaluation:** The Project Manager will assess the impact of the change on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
* **Change Approval:** Changes exceeding a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 10% of original scope) will require approval from the Project Sponsor.
* **Change Implementation:** Approved changes will be implemented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.
* **Change Verification:** The implemented changes will be verified through testing.

**6.2 Scope Baseline:** The approved Requirements Specification document and the WBS will constitute the project scope baseline.  Any deviations from this baseline will be handled via the change control process.

**7.  Scope Performance Measurement**

Regular monitoring of scope progress will be conducted using Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques.  Key metrics will include:

* **Schedule Variance:**  Difference between planned and actual schedule.
* **Cost Variance:** Difference between planned and actual cost.
* **Scope Variance:**  Difference between planned and actual scope.
* **Requirements Volatility:**  Measure of changes to requirements.


**8.  Stakeholder Engagement**

Regular communication with stakeholders will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle to ensure alignment on scope and to address any issues or concerns promptly.  Communication will be facilitated through regular meetings, email updates, and status reports.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes and ensure its effectiveness.
