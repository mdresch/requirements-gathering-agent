   - Ensure 100% scope coverage (no gaps or overlaps)
   - Apply the 100% rule at each level

2. **WBS Structure Guidelines**
   - Each level represents increasing detail and specificity
   - Work packages should be 8-80 hours of effort (1-2 weeks)
   - Each element should have clear, measurable deliverables
   - WBS should facilitate assignment of responsibility
   - Use noun-based naming (deliverables, not activities)
   - Maintain consistent numbering scheme throughout

3. **WBS Quality Criteria**
   - Mutually exclusive elements (no overlap)
   - Collectively exhaustive coverage (complete scope)
   - Appropriate level of detail for management
   - Clear deliverable orientation

### WBS Organization
The WBS will be organized using a deliverable-oriented structure:  (Placeholder example)

**Level 1:** Project Name ([object Object])
**Level 2:** Requirements Gathering, System Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Training
**Level 3:** Specific tasks within each Level 2 element
**Level 4:** Work Packages

### WBS Dictionary
For each WBS element, the following information will be documented:
- WBS element identifier and name
- Description of work to be performed
- Responsible organization/person
