## Scope Management Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th edition standards and ensures that the project delivers the intended value while controlling scope creep.  This plan will be reviewed and updated at each project phase closure.

**2. Scope Management Objectives**

*   Define and document a clear, concise, and comprehensive project scope.
*   Establish a baseline scope and control deviations from that baseline.
*   Maintain stakeholder alignment on the project scope.
*   Identify, assess, and manage scope changes effectively.
*   Ensure timely and efficient scope verification and validation.

**3. Scope Management Methodology**

We will employ a combination of iterative and incremental approaches to scope management. This will involve:

*   **Iterative Scope Definition:** Refining the scope based on feedback from stakeholders and lessons learned during development iterations.
*   **Incremental Delivery:** Delivering functional components of the ADPA in increments, allowing for continuous scope verification and validation.
*   **Agile Principles:** Incorporating agile principles for flexibility and responsiveness to changing requirements.

**4. Scope Planning**

**4.1 Scope Planning Process:**

1.  **Requirements Elicitation:**  Gathering requirements from the project charter, README.md, existing documentation (StakeholderRegister.md, BusinessCase.md, etc.), and stakeholder interviews.  This will leverage the ADPA's existing capabilities for analyzing project documentation and identifying key stakeholders.
2.  **Scope Definition:** Creating a detailed Project Scope Statement that clearly defines the project deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.  This will be based on the initial scope definition already established by the ADPA itself (ProjectScopeStatement.md) and refined further.
3.  **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Creation:**  Developing a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into manageable work packages.  This will build upon the inherent modularity of the ADPA's architecture.
4.  **Scope Baseline Establishment:**  Formally approving and documenting the WBS and Project Scope Statement to establish the project's baseline scope.
5.  **Scope Validation:**  Reviewing the Project Scope Statement and WBS with key stakeholders to ensure mutual understanding and agreement.

**4.2 Scope Planning Inputs:**

*   Project Charter (ProjectCharter.md)
*   README.md file
*   Stakeholder Register (StakeholderRegister.md)
*   Business Case (BusinessCase.md)
*   Existing project documentation (Architecture.md, Requirements Management Plan, etc.)
*   Organizational Process Assets (templates, standards)

**4.3 Scope Planning Outputs:**

*   Project Scope Statement (updated and refined)
*   Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
*   WBS Dictionary
*   Scope Baseline
*   Requirements Traceability Matrix

**5. Scope Definition**

**5.1 Project Scope Statement:**  The Project Scope Statement will include:

*   **Project Objectives:**  Clearly defined goals and aims of the ADPA project.
*   **Project Deliverables:**  A comprehensive list of all planned outputs, including the technical design documents, PMBOK documents, and strategic business communication documents.  Specifically, this will include the 10 specialized technical document processors, the comprehensive PMBOK document suite, and the business communication translator system.
*   **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific and measurable criteria for determining if each deliverable meets stakeholder expectations.  This will include PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation criteria.
*   **Project Exclusions:**  A clear list of items that are explicitly excluded from the project scope (e.g., integration with specific third-party tools not currently supported).
*   **Assumptions and Constraints:**  Identification of any assumptions made and constraints imposed on the project (e.g., budget, timeline, resource availability).

**5.2 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** The WBS will be a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope, reflecting the modular architecture of the ADPA.  It will be organized by document type and functionality, ensuring each work package is clearly defined and manageable.

**6. Scope Verification and Validation**

**6.1 Scope Verification:**  This process will involve:

*   **Inspection and Reviews:**  Regular reviews of the project deliverables against the acceptance criteria.
*   **Testing:**  Thorough testing of the ADPA's functionality to verify that the deliverables meet the specified requirements.  This will include unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
*   **Walkthroughs and Demonstrations:**  Presenting the ADPA and its outputs to stakeholders for feedback and approval.

**6.2 Scope Validation:**  Formal acceptance of the project deliverables by key stakeholders.  This will involve a sign-off process confirming that the deliverables meet the acceptance criteria and project objectives.

**7. Scope Change Control**

**7.1 Change Request Process:**  A formal process for managing scope changes, including:

1.  **Change Request Submission:**  A formal request documenting the proposed change, its justification, and impact analysis.
2.  **Change Request Evaluation:**  Assessment of the change's impact on scope, schedule, cost, and risk.
3.  **Change Request Approval:**  Approval or rejection of the change request by the designated authority (Project Manager or Change Control Board).
4.  **Change Implementation:**  Implementing the approved change and updating relevant documentation.
5.  **Change Verification:**  Verifying that the implemented change meets expectations.

**7.2 Change Control Board (CCB):**  A designated group responsible for reviewing and approving major scope changes.  The CCB will consist of key stakeholders, including the Project Manager, Sponsor, and representatives from relevant departments.

**8. Scope Control Tools and Techniques**

*   **Software tools:** Project management software (e.g., Jira, Microsoft Project) for tracking progress, managing tasks, and documenting changes.
*   **Document control system:** Version control system (Git) for managing project documentation and ensuring traceability.
*   **Regular meetings:** Frequent meetings with stakeholders to review progress, discuss issues, and manage changes.
*   **Regular reporting:** Providing regular reports on scope progress, changes, and risks.

**9.  Risk Management related to Scope**

The project will proactively identify and manage risks that could impact scope, including:

*   **Requirements Volatility:**  Changes in stakeholder requirements during project execution.  Mitigation: Iterative development, frequent stakeholder communication, and a robust change control process.
*   **Technical Challenges:**  Unexpected technical difficulties during development. Mitigation: Thorough planning, risk assessment, contingency planning, and experienced development team.
*   **Resource Constraints:**  Limited availability of resources (personnel, budget, time). Mitigation: Careful resource planning, prioritization of tasks, and effective resource allocation.


**10.  Scope Management Team Responsibilities**

*   **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for scope management, including planning, definition, verification, and control.
*   **Business Analyst:** Responsible for requirements elicitation, analysis, and documentation.
*   **Development Team:** Responsible for delivering the ADPA and its functionality according to the defined scope.
*   **Testing Team:** Responsible for verifying the deliverables meet the acceptance criteria.
*   **Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing and approving the scope, providing feedback, and participating in the change control process.


This Scope Management Plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the ADPA project.  It will be a living document, updated and refined as the project progresses to reflect changes and lessons learned.
