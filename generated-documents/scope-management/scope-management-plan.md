## 1. Purpose and Objectives

**Purpose**  
This Scope Management Plan describes how the scope of the ADPA project will be defined, validated, and controlled in accordance with PMBOK guidelines. It ensures the project delivers a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis, as per stakeholder expectations.

**Objectives**
- Establish systematic procedures for scope planning, definition, verification, and change control.
- Ensure all project deliverables align with business requirements and industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0).
- Prevent scope creep and manage scope changes in a controlled and transparent manner.
- Facilitate stakeholder visibility and alignment throughout the project lifecycle.
