## Scope Management Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th edition standards and addresses scope planning, definition, verification, and control.  The plan aims to ensure that all necessary work, and only the necessary work, is included within the project, meeting stakeholder expectations while remaining within defined constraints.  Given the AI-driven nature of the project, iterative processes and flexibility are crucial.

**2. Scope Management Methodology**

A combination of iterative and incremental approaches will be used for scope management.  The project will utilize a phased approach, with scope defined and verified at the end of each phase.  This allows for adjustments based on learnings and feedback, accommodating the evolving nature of AI technology and its application within this project.

**3. Scope Planning**

**3.1 Scope Planning Process:**

The scope planning process will involve the following activities:

* **Requirements Gathering:**  Leveraging the existing comprehensive project documentation (README, specifications, etc.), further requirements will be elicited through stakeholder interviews, workshops, and analysis of existing documentation.  The AI's own generated documents (Business Case, Stakeholder Register, Project Scope Statement) will be critically reviewed and incorporated.  Requirements will be documented using a consistent format (e.g., user stories, use cases).
* **Scope Definition:**  A detailed Project Scope Statement will be created, clearly defining the project deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and constraints.  This will include a comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with a WBS Dictionary providing detailed descriptions of each work package.
* **Scope Baseline Establishment:**  The approved Project Scope Statement and WBS will form the project scope baseline, serving as the benchmark against which future scope changes will be measured.
* **Scope Validation:**  The scope baseline will be reviewed and validated with key stakeholders to ensure alignment and agreement on the project scope.  This validation will be documented formally.

**3.2 Scope Planning Inputs:**

* Project Charter (already generated by the AI)
* Project README and associated documentation
* Stakeholder Register (already generated by the AI)
* Business Case (already generated by the AI)
* Risk Register (already generated by the AI)
* Lessons Learned from previous projects
* Expert Judgment (Project Manager and key stakeholders)

**3.3 Scope Planning Outputs:**

* Project Scope Statement (formal document)
* Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
* WBS Dictionary
* Scope Baseline
* Requirements Traceability Matrix
* Approved Scope Management Plan


**4. Scope Definition**

**4.1 Scope Definition Process:**

This phase will refine the initial scope, leveraging the AI's initial output as a starting point.

* **Refinement of AI-Generated Documents:** The AI-generated Project Scope Statement, Stakeholder Register, and Business Case will be reviewed and refined by the project team and stakeholders to ensure accuracy, completeness, and alignment with overall project goals.  This includes clarifying ambiguities and resolving any conflicts.
* **Detailed Requirements Definition:**  Functional and non-functional requirements will be documented and prioritized using a method such as MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
* **Deliverable Definition:**  A detailed list of deliverables will be created, including specific acceptance criteria for each deliverable.
* **WBS Decomposition:**  The WBS will be further decomposed into smaller, manageable work packages.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Preliminary allocation of resources (personnel, budget, tools) to work packages will be made.

**4.2 Scope Definition Inputs:**

* Outputs from Scope Planning
* Stakeholder feedback
* Technical feasibility assessments
* Resource availability

**4.3 Scope Definition Outputs:**

* Refined Project Scope Statement
* Detailed WBS
* Detailed WBS Dictionary
* Resource Allocation Plan
* Updated Requirements Traceability Matrix


**5. Scope Verification**

**5.1 Scope Verification Process:**

* **Inspection and Review:**  Regular inspections and reviews will be conducted throughout the project lifecycle to verify that the work performed conforms to the approved scope baseline.  This includes reviews of deliverables, code, and documentation.
* **Acceptance Testing:**  Rigorous testing will be conducted, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  UAT will involve key stakeholders to validate that the system meets their requirements.
* **Formal Acceptance:**  Formal sign-off will be obtained from stakeholders upon successful completion of UAT and verification that all acceptance criteria have been met.

**5.2 Scope Verification Inputs:**

* Deliverables
* Test results
* Stakeholder feedback
* Project Scope Statement
* Acceptance criteria

**5.3 Scope Verification Outputs:**

* Verified deliverables
* Acceptance sign-off documents
* Lessons learned


**6. Scope Control**

**6.1 Scope Change Control Process:**

* **Change Request Submission:**  All scope changes must be formally requested using a standardized change request form.  The form will include a description of the change, justification, impact analysis, and proposed solution.
* **Change Request Review:**  The Change Control Board (CCB), composed of the Project Manager, key stakeholders, and relevant technical experts, will review and evaluate each change request.
* **Change Approval/Rejection:**  The CCB will approve or reject change requests based on their impact on project scope, schedule, cost, and risk.
* **Change Implementation:**  Approved changes will be implemented according to a documented process, with updates to the scope baseline, project schedule, and cost estimates.  Communication of changes will be distributed to relevant stakeholders.

**6.2 Scope Change Control Inputs:**

* Change requests
* Impact analysis
* CCB decisions
* Updated documentation

**6.3 Scope Change Control Outputs:**

* Updated Project Scope Statement
* Updated WBS
* Updated WBS Dictionary
* Revised schedule
* Revised budget
* Change log


**7.  Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for scope management.
* **Business Analyst:**  Responsible for requirements gathering and documentation.
* **Technical Lead:** Responsible for technical scope validation and implementation.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):**  Responsible for reviewing and approving scope changes.
* **Stakeholders:**  Responsible for providing input and validating the project scope.


**8. Tools and Techniques**

* **Software:** Project management software (e.g., Jira, Microsoft Project), version control system (Git).
* **Techniques:**  Requirements elicitation techniques (interviews, workshops), WBS decomposition, inspection, variance analysis, earned value management.


**9.  Measurement and Reporting**

Regular progress reports will be provided, including metrics on scope performance, such as:

* Percentage of scope completed
* Number of change requests
* Change request approval rate
* Variance from baseline
* Defect rates


**10.  Contingency Planning**

The plan includes provisions for handling unexpected events that may impact the project scope.  This includes a process for evaluating and addressing risks identified in the Risk Register.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes and learnings, ensuring its continued effectiveness in managing the ADPA project scope.
