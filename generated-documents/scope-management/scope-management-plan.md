## Scope Management Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It adheres to PMBOK Guide standards and best practices, ensuring that the project deliverables meet stakeholder expectations while mitigating scope creep.

**2. Project Scope Statement**

The project aims to develop a production-ready API that leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks and PMBOK-compliant project management documents.  Key features include:

* **Automated Framework Generation:**  Rapid generation of BABOK v3 and PMBOK compliant documents (stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, etc.).
* **Multi-AI Provider Support:**  Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) for flexibility and redundancy.
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Robust authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation.
* **Multi-Format Output:** Generation of documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* **API-First Design:**  Utilizing TypeSpec for API specification and OpenAPI 3.0 generation.
* **CLI Interface:**  Command-line interface for easy interaction and automation.

**In-Scope Deliverables:**

* Production-ready Express.js API
* Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI 3.0)
* CLI application for user interaction
* Minimum viable set of BABOK v3 and PMBOK templates
* Unit and integration tests
* Deployment scripts and documentation

**Out-of-Scope Deliverables:**

* Integration with third-party project management tools (beyond initial feasibility study)
* Support for additional frameworks beyond BABOK v3 and PMBOK (future phases)
* Extensive user interface (beyond CLI)
* Advanced analytics and reporting features (future phases)
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial warranty period


**3. Scope Planning**

**3.1. Requirements Gathering:**

* **Methods:** Stakeholder interviews, document analysis (provided README and related documents), prototyping.
* **Tools:**  Confluence (or similar), Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
* **Deliverables:**  Completed RTM, prioritized requirements list, approved requirements specification document.

**3.2. Scope Definition:**

* **Methods:**  Decomposition, WBS creation, scope baseline establishment.
* **Tools:** Microsoft Project, MindManager (or similar).
* **Deliverables:**  Approved project scope statement, detailed WBS, WBS dictionary, approved scope baseline.

**3.3. Scope Verification:**

* **Methods:** Inspections, reviews, walkthroughs, testing (unit, integration, system, user acceptance testing â€“ UAT).
* **Tools:**  JIRA, TestRail (or similar), automated testing frameworks.
* **Deliverables:**  Test plans, test reports, UAT sign-off documentation, approved deliverables.

**4. Scope Definition and Control**

**4.1. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

The WBS will be a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope, breaking down the project into manageable work packages.  An example structure:

* 1.0 API Development
    * 1.1 Backend Development (Controllers, Services, Models)
    * 1.2 API Security Implementation
    * 1.3 API Testing and Validation
* 2.0 CLI Development
    * 2.1 CLI Interface Design
    * 2.2 CLI Functionality Implementation
    * 2.3 CLI Testing
* 3.0 Documentation
    * 3.1 API Documentation
    * 3.2 User Manual
    * 3.3 Deployment Guide
* 4.0 Testing and Quality Assurance
    * 4.1 Unit Testing
    * 4.2 Integration Testing
    * 4.3 System Testing
    * 4.4 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
* 5.0 Deployment

**4.2.  Scope Baseline:**  The approved project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary will form the project scope baseline.  Any changes to the baseline will be managed through a formal change control process.

**4.3. Change Control:**

* **Process:**  All change requests will be documented formally, assessed for impact (scope, schedule, cost, quality, risk), approved by the Change Control Board (CCB), and implemented according to a defined procedure.
* **CCB:**  Project Manager, Lead Developer, Business Analyst, and a representative from the sponsoring organization.
* **Tools:**  JIRA (or similar) for change request tracking and management.
* **Deliverables:**  Approved Change Requests, updated scope baseline, updated project schedule and budget.

**5. Scope Verification and Acceptance**

Formal acceptance of deliverables will occur at the completion of each major phase and at project closure.  Acceptance will be based on the pre-defined acceptance criteria specified in the WBS dictionary and documented in the formal sign-off process.

**6. Scope Performance Measurement**

Regular monitoring and reporting will track scope performance against the baseline. Key metrics include:

* **Scope Variance:**  Tracking deviations from the scope baseline.
* **Change Request Volume:**  Monitoring the number and type of change requests.
* **Change Request Cycle Time:**  Measuring the time taken to process change requests.
* **Defect Density:** Tracking defects found during testing.

**7.  Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for scope management.
* **Lead Developer:** Responsible for technical scope and deliverables.
* **Business Analyst:**  Responsible for requirements gathering and scope definition.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):** Responsible for reviewing and approving change requests.


**8.  Plan Updates**

This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated at least monthly or as needed to reflect changes in project scope, risks, or constraints.  Updates will be communicated to all stakeholders.


This detailed Scope Management Plan provides a comprehensive framework for managing the scope of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensuring its success by proactively addressing potential issues and maintaining clear communication and accountability throughout the project lifecycle.
