## Purpose and Objectives

### Purpose
This Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope will be planned, developed, monitored, verified, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle for the [object Object] project. It provides the framework for managing scope-related activities and ensuring project deliverables meet stakeholder expectations.  Given the lack of initial project description, this plan will serve as a template, adaptable once the project details are defined.

### Objectives
- Establish clear processes for scope planning and definition once project details are available.
- Define procedures for scope verification and acceptance upon project deliverables identification.
- Implement effective scope change control mechanisms to be defined in accordance with the project's complexity and risk profile.
- Ensure stakeholder alignment on project scope as soon as stakeholders are identified and their requirements are gathered.
- Prevent scope creep and manage scope changes systematically using a robust change control process to be defined later.

## Scope Planning Process

### Scope Planning Activities
1. **Requirements Collection**
   - Stakeholder identification and analysis (to be performed once project details are provided)
   - Stakeholder interviews and workshops (to be scheduled upon stakeholder identification)
   - Requirements elicitation techniques (interviews, surveys, observation) (to be selected based on project needs)
   - Requirements documentation and analysis (to be performed after requirements gathering)
   - Requirements prioritization and validation (MoSCoW method) (to be applied once requirements are documented)
   - Requirements traceability establishment (to be implemented upon requirements definition)
   - Requirements change management setup (to be defined based on the project's change management process)

2. **Scope Definition**
   - Project scope statement development (to be created once project details are available)
   - Product scope vs project scope delineation (to be defined based on project deliverables)
   - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) creation using decomposition (to be developed after scope definition)
   - WBS dictionary preparation with detailed descriptions (to be created concurrently with WBS development)
   - Scope baseline establishment and approval (to be established and approved after scope definition)
   - Scope boundaries definition (in-scope vs out-of-scope) (to be clearly defined in the project scope statement)

3. **Acceptance Criteria Definition**
   - Deliverable acceptance criteria specification (to be defined for each deliverable)
   - Quality standards and metrics definition (to be defined based on project requirements)
   - Verification and validation procedures (to be defined based on the chosen testing methodology)
   - Sign-off criteria establishment (to be defined for each deliverable)
   - User acceptance testing (UAT) planning (to be planned after deliverables are defined)
   - Quality gates and checkpoints definition (to be defined based on project risk profile)

4. **Scope Validation Planning**
   - Scope verification process design (to be defined based on project deliverables)
   - Acceptance testing strategy development (to be developed after deliverables and acceptance criteria are defined)
   - Stakeholder review and approval procedures (to be established based on stakeholder roles and responsibilities)
   - Quality assurance integration planning (to be integrated with the overall quality management plan)

### Scope Planning Inputs
- Project charter and business case (to be provided)
- Stakeholder requirements documentation (to be gathered)
- Organizational process assets (to be identified)
- Enterprise environmental factors (to be identified)
- Expert judgment and historical data (to be leveraged as needed)

### Scope Planning Outputs
- Project scope statement (to be created)
- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (to be developed)
- WBS dictionary (to be created)
- Scope baseline (to be established)
- Requirements documentation (to be produced)

## Scope Definition Process

### Project Scope Statement
The project scope statement will include:

#### Product Scope Description
**In Scope:**
- *To be defined once project details are available.*

**Explicit Exclusions (Out of Scope):**
The project scope statement will include comprehensive explicit exclusions organized by category:

- **Functional Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*
- **Technical Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*
- **Business Process Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*
- **Data and Content Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*
- **Infrastructure Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*
- **Support and Maintenance Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*
- **Future Phase Exclusions:** *To be defined once project details are available.*

*Note: Detailed exclusions will be documented in the Project Scope Statement following the enhanced exclusion framework.*
