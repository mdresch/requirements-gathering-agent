# Scope Management Plan

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

**Project Description:** The RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  It supports multiple AI providers, features a CLI interface, and utilizes template-based document creation for efficient and consistent output.  The project aims to improve project management efficiency and documentation quality.

**Project Deliverables:**  The key deliverables include a functional application (RGA), comprehensive user documentation, and a suite of PMBOK-compliant document templates.  Specific deliverables are detailed in Section 3.


## 2. Purpose and Objectives

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project throughout its lifecycle.  The primary objectives are to:

* **Define the project scope clearly and unambiguously:**  This includes identifying what is included (in-scope) and excluded (out-of-scope) from the project.
* **Establish a robust process for managing scope changes:** This minimizes disruption and ensures that changes are properly evaluated and authorized.
* **Verify that the project deliverables meet the defined scope:** This ensures that the final product meets stakeholder expectations and requirements.
* **Control scope creep and maintain project schedule and budget:**  This prevents uncontrolled expansion of the project scope, leading to cost and time overruns.


## 3. Scope Definition

This section details the project's deliverables and their acceptance criteria.  The information is derived from the provided project documentation (02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD, PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD, etc.).

**3.1 Product Scope Description:**

**In Scope:**

* Development of a command-line interface (CLI) application for generating PMBOK documentation.
* Integration with at least three AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, and one other, to be determined).
* Generation of PMBOK-compliant documents including: project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.
* Support for template-based document generation.
* JSON-formatted output for all generated documents.
* Schema validation of generated outputs to ensure PMBOK compliance and data integrity.
* Basic user documentation and tutorials.

**Out of Scope:**

* Integration with third-party project management tools (initially).  This may be considered in future releases.
* Advanced security features (e.g., audit trails, detailed security classifications, regulatory metadata).  These are explicitly excluded per PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD.
* Graphical User Interface (GUI). The project will focus solely on a CLI.
* Support for more than three AI providers initially (expansion possible in future releases).

## 4. Scope Baseline

The scope baseline will be established after the completion of the Scope Definition process. It will consist of the approved Project Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and WBS Dictionary.  Any changes to the scope baseline will be managed through a formal change control process (detailed in Section 6).


## 5. Scope Verification

Scope verification will be an ongoing process throughout the project.  Key activities include:

* **Regular reviews of deliverables:**  Each deliverable will be reviewed against its acceptance criteria.
* **Testing:**  Thorough unit, integration, and system testing will ensure that the application meets its functional and non-functional requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  A limited UAT will be conducted to validate user experience and ensure that the application meets stakeholder expectations.
* **Formal acceptance:**  Stakeholders will formally accept each deliverable upon successful completion of the verification process.


## 6. Scope Control

A formal change control process will be implemented to manage any changes to the project scope.  This process includes:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  All changes will be documented in a formal change request form.
2. **Change Impact Assessment:**  The impact of the proposed change on the project schedule, budget, and resources will be assessed.
3. **Change Review and Approval:**  The change request will be reviewed and approved by the Change Control Board (CCB).  The CCB will consist of the Project Manager, a representative from the development team, and a key stakeholder.
4. **Change Implementation:**  Approved changes will be implemented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.
5. **Change Tracking:**  All changes will be documented and tracked to ensure transparency and accountability.

**Change Request Classification:**  Changes will be classified as minor, moderate, or major based on their impact.  The approval authority will vary depending on the classification.

## 7. Tools and Techniques

* **WBS Creation:**  Microsoft Project or similar project management software.
* **Requirements Tracking:**  A requirements traceability matrix will be used to track requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Change Management:**  A dedicated change management tool or system (if available) or a spreadsheet for tracking change requests.
* **Document Management:**  SharePoint or a similar repository.


## 8.  Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall scope management, change control, and communication.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for developing and testing the application.
* **Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing deliverables and providing feedback.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):** Responsible for reviewing and approving/rejecting change requests.


## 9.  Reporting

Regular progress reports will be provided to stakeholders, highlighting scope progress, change requests, and any potential issues.  These reports will be delivered weekly and will include key metrics such as:

* Percentage of deliverables completed.
* Number of open change requests.
* Any identified scope creep.


This Scope Management Plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes or learnings.
