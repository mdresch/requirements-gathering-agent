# Control Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Control Scope process for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The RGA project aims to develop an AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  Given the project's reliance on rapidly evolving AI technologies and the diverse range of potential outputs, a robust scope management process is crucial for success.  This process focuses on maintaining alignment with the defined requirements while accommodating necessary changes efficiently and transparently.

## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Maintain alignment between project deliverables and the approved scope baseline.
* Manage and control changes to the scope baseline effectively.
* Ensure timely and accurate reporting of scope performance.
* Minimize disruptions and delays caused by scope creep.
* Facilitate stakeholder communication regarding scope changes and performance.

**Control Activities:**

* **Proactive Monitoring:** Regularly monitor progress against the scope baseline using defined KPIs (see Section 4).
* **Change Management:** Implement a formal change request process (see Section 3).
* **Variance Analysis:** Analyze deviations from the baseline and identify root causes (see Section 5).
* **Corrective Action:** Implement corrective actions to address negative variances and prevent future issues (see Section 6).
* **Documentation:** Maintain meticulous records of all scope-related decisions, changes, and analyses.


## 3. Change Control System

**Change Request Process:**

1. **Identification:** Any proposed change to the project scope (functional or non-functional requirements, deliverables, timelines) is documented as a formal change request.  This can be initiated by any stakeholder.
2. **Documentation:** The change request must include a clear description of the proposed change, its rationale, potential impact on schedule, cost, and quality, and any necessary supporting documentation.
3. **Impact Assessment:** The project manager assesses the impact of the proposed change, consulting with relevant stakeholders as needed.  This assessment considers technical feasibility, resource availability, and potential risks.  For significant changes, external consultation (e.g., architecture team) may be required.
4. **Review and Approval:** The change request is reviewed and approved according to the approval matrix (see below).  Documentation of the approval process is crucial.
5. **Implementation:** Once approved, the change is implemented according to a defined plan, incorporating any necessary updates to schedules, budgets, and documentation.
6. **Verification:** After implementation, the change is verified to ensure it meets the requirements and has not introduced unintended consequences.
7. **Baseline Update:** The project baseline is formally updated to reflect the approved changes.


**Approval Authority Matrix:**

| Change Type                      | Impact Level | Approval Authority           |
|----------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Minor bug fixes, documentation updates | Low            | Project Manager              |
| Minor feature enhancements, UI tweaks | Moderate       | Project Manager & Tech Lead |
| Major feature additions, architectural changes | High           | Steering Committee           |
| Scope reductions                  | High           | Sponsor & Customer           |


## 4. Performance Monitoring

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

* **Scope Completion Percentage:** Tracks the percentage of planned scope completed.
* **Deliverable Acceptance Rate:** Measures the percentage of deliverables accepted by stakeholders.
* **Change Request Frequency:** Monitors the number of change requests received, indicating potential scope instability.
* **Scope Variance:** Tracks the difference between planned and actual scope.


**Measurement Methods:**

* Regular progress meetings and status reports.
* Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques, if applicable.
* Tracking of completed work packages against the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).
* Review of test results to assess the completeness of implemented features.


**Monitoring Frequency:**

* **Daily:** informal check-ins on progress.
* **Weekly:** formal status meetings with progress reports.
* **Monthly:** comprehensive scope performance review.


## 5. Variance Analysis

**Variance Types:**

* **Scope Variance:** Difference between planned and actual scope.
* **Schedule Variance:** Difference between planned and actual schedule.
* **Cost Variance:** Difference between planned and actual cost.


**Analysis Process:**

1. **Variance Identification:** Identify any significant deviations from the planned scope, schedule, or cost.
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Determine the underlying causes of the variances using techniques like the 5 Whys.
3. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate the impact of the variances on project objectives.
4. **Corrective Action Planning:** Develop a plan to address the identified variances.


## 6. Change Management (Detailed Implementation)

The change management process detailed in Section 3 will be supported by the following:

* **Change Request Form:** A standardized form for submitting change requests, ensuring consistency and completeness.
* **Change Log:** A centralized repository of all approved and rejected change requests, providing a complete history of scope changes.
* **Impact Assessment Template:** A template for documenting the impact analysis of proposed changes.


## 7. Corrective Actions

Corrective actions will focus on addressing the root causes of variances identified during variance analysis.  This may involve:

* **Process Improvements:** Refining the project management processes to prevent similar variances in the future.
* **Resource Allocation:** Adjusting resource allocation to address bottlenecks or skill gaps.
* **Schedule Adjustments:** Revising the project schedule to accommodate changes or delays.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Implementing risk mitigation strategies to address identified risks.


## 8. Communication Framework

Regular communication is crucial for effective scope management. This will include:

* **Weekly Status Reports:**  Updates on scope progress, variances, and upcoming milestones.
* **Change Notifications:** Timely notification of all approved and rejected change requests.
* **Stakeholder Meetings:** Regular meetings with key stakeholders to review scope performance and address concerns.


## 9. Tools and Techniques

The project will utilize the following tools and techniques:

* **Project Management Software:**  (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) for task management, progress tracking, and reporting.
* **Version Control System:** (e.g., Git) for managing code and documentation changes.
* **Collaboration Tools:** (e.g., Microsoft Teams, Slack) for communication and collaboration.


## 10. Continuous Improvement

The scope management process will be continuously reviewed and improved based on lessons learned and stakeholder feedback.  This includes regular post-project reviews to identify areas for improvement.


This detailed Control Scope Process provides a framework for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Adherence to this process is crucial for successful project delivery.
