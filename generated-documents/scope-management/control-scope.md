# Control Scope Process  
**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.0  
**Standards Alignment:** BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0 (in progress)  
**Document Owner:** ADPA Project Management Office (PMO)

## 1. Introduction

The Control Scope process for the ADPA project ensures that all scope-related activities—including requirements automation, standards compliance, and enterprise integration—remain aligned with approved baselines. This process is critical to delivering modular, standards-compliant automation capabilities as defined in the project charter, and to supporting continuous delivery of professional, AI-powered documentation tools for the enterprise.

---

## 2. Process Overview

### Key Objectives
- Continuously monitor implemented scope against the baseline (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK frameworks)
- Identify, document, and evaluate scope changes, especially those arising from evolving enterprise compliance or integration requirements
- Maintain the integrity of the scope baseline while supporting agility for regulatory or technology-driven change
- Engage stakeholders proactively to manage expectations and reduce the risk of scope creep

### Control Activities
- Automated performance measurement through built-in metrics and reporting dashboards
- Variance analysis leveraging ADPA’s analytics and reporting modules
- Rigorous change evaluation, prioritizing standards compliance and enterprise integration impacts
- Implementation of corrective actions using ADPA’s workflow automation features

## 3. Change Control System

### Change Request Process

1. **Change Identification**
   - Triggered by new regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOX), framework updates, or enterprise integration requests (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, API enhancements)
2. **Request Documentation**
   - All change proposals logged via the ADPA admin interface or API, referencing affected modules, integrations, or compliance frameworks
3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Automated and manual assessment using ADPA’s analytics dashboard to model impacts on schedule, cost, quality, and compliance
4. **Review and Approval**
   - Multi-level review process engaging technical leads, compliance officers, and the steering committee as appropriate
5. **Implementation**
   - Approved changes scheduled for development; tracked via the CLI, REST API, and project management integrations (Jira, Azure DevOps)
6. **Baseline Update**
   - Scope baseline updated in documentation and configuration repositories; version-controlled via GitHub Enterprise or equivalent

### Approval Authority
- **Minor changes:** Project Manager (e.g., template tweaks, minor CLI/API improvements)
- **Moderate changes:** Steering Committee (e.g., new integration endpoints, framework template additions)
- **Major changes:** Project Sponsor (e.g., major architecture change, new compliance frameworks)
- **Scope reduction:** Customer/Enterprise Stakeholder approval (e.g., removal of planned frameworks or features)

## 4. Performance Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Scope Completion Percentage:** % of framework features (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK) fully implemented and released
- **Deliverable Acceptance Rate:** % of generated documents/templates accepted by stakeholders or compliance audits
- **Change Request Frequency:** Number and category of scope change requests per phase
- **Scope Variance Percentage:** Actual scope delivered vs. approved baseline (tracked via ADPA analytics)

### Measurement Methods
- **Earned Value Analysis:** Integrated with project management tools (Jira/Azure DevOps)
- **Milestone Tracking:** Automated milestone reporting by ADPA admin interface
- **Deliverable Status Reporting:** Real-time status in API/web dashboard; exportable to SharePoint/Confluence
- **Work Package Completion:** Monitored at module and integration level (e.g., Adobe, SharePoint, AI providers)

### Monitoring Frequency
- **Daily:** Automated work package progress updates
- **Weekly:** Deliverable and integration status review
- **Monthly:** Scope performance review and retrospective
- **Quarterly:** Formal baseline assessment and roadmap update

## 5. Variance Analysis

### Variance Types
- **Schedule Variance:** Delay in milestone or deliverable completion
- **Scope Variance:** Deviation from planned framework coverage or integration targets
- **Quality Variance:** Non-compliance with standards (BABOK/PMBOK/DMBOK) or document quality issues
- **Resource Variance:** Unplanned resource allocation or provider outages (e.g., AI provider failover events)

### Analysis Process
1. **Variance Identification:** Automated alerts via ADPA dashboards and manual PM review
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigation using analytics and team input (e.g., feature complexity, provider limitations)
3. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluate implications for schedule, cost, and compliance
4. **Trend Analysis:** Monitor for recurring variances (e.g., frequent AI provider changes)
5. **Recommendation Development:** Proposed corrective/preventive actions documented and reviewed

### Threshold Management
- **Green:** ±5% variance (acceptable, monitor only)
- **Yellow:** ±10% variance (review and escalate as needed)
- **Red:** >±10% variance (immediate corrective action and stakeholder notification)

---

## 6. Change Management

### Change Categories
- **Scope Additions:** New framework modules, integration endpoints, AI provider support
- **Scope Reductions:** De-prioritization or removal of planned features (requires stakeholder approval)
- **Quality Modifications:** Changes in acceptance criteria or document quality standards
- **Acceptance Criteria Changes:** Updates to what constitutes an acceptable deliverable (e.g., regulatory compliance, new documentation formats)

### Impact Assessment
- **Schedule Impact:** Timeline adjustments for integration or compliance changes
- **Cost Implications:** Licensing, API usage, or resource costs (e.g., additional AI provider workloads)
- **Resource Requirements:** Additional development, testing, or support staff
- **Risk Assessment:** Increased risk from new technology or regulatory requirements
- **Quality Impact:** Effects on documentation standardization and compliance

### Documentation Requirements
- Change request form (via admin interface or API)
- Impact analysis report (automated and manual inputs)
- Approval documentation (digital signatures, audit trail)
- Implementation plan (task breakdown, timeline)
- Lessons learned (post-implementation review)

## 7. Corrective Actions

### Action Types
- **Process Adjustments:** Update workflow automation rules, documentation templates, or review cycles
- **Resource Reallocation:** Assign additional staff to delayed modules or integrations
- **Schedule Modifications:** Reschedule milestones, update project timeline
- **Quality Improvements:** Refactor document generators, enhance compliance validation

### Implementation Process
1. **Action Planning:** Develop detailed corrective plan with clear outcomes and KPIs
2. **Resource Allocation:** Assign required personnel or tools
