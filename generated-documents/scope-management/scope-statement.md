## 1. Project Scope Description

### 1.1 Project Purpose and Justification

The ADPA project aims to deliver a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework that supports AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis aligned with industry standards including BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. This initiative addresses the growing need for scalable, secure, and compliant automation tools in large enterprises, particularly Fortune 500 organizations, to improve efficiency, governance, and regulatory adherence in documentation workflows.

The business justification lies in automating complex, standards-driven documentation processes, reducing manual effort, improving consistency, and enabling enterprise-wide integration with popular platforms such as Atlassian Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services. This project supports strategic enterprise goals of digital transformation, compliance with financial and security regulations (e.g., GDPR, SOX, Basel III), and leveraging AI technologies in document and data management.

### 1.2 Product Scope Description

The ADPA framework will provide:

- A Node.js/TypeScript-based modular architecture with CLI and REST API interfaces
