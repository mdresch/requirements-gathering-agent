## 1. Project Scope Description

This project aims to automate the monthly backup process for Project Backup Vermigerous, enhancing reliability, security, and recoverability.  The current manual backup process is inefficient and poses a risk to data integrity and business continuity. This project will implement automated backup scheduling, incremental/differential backups, data integrity checks, secure storage, metadata tagging, automated recovery testing, and monitoring/alerting.  The ultimate goal is to minimize downtime in case of system failure and ensure rapid, reliable data restoration.

### 1.1 Project Purpose and Justification

The current manual backup process for Project Backup Vermigerous is time-consuming, prone to human error, and lacks robust security and validation mechanisms. Automation will improve efficiency, reduce risk, and ensure business continuity by providing a reliable and secure backup and recovery solution.  System failures currently lead to significant downtime and data loss; this project directly mitigates that risk.

### 1.2 Product Scope Description

The project will deliver a fully automated backup and recovery system for Project Backup Vermigerous. This system will include automated scheduling, incremental/differential backups, data integrity verification, secure storage in immutable blob storage with encryption, metadata tagging for easy retrieval, automated recovery testing, and comprehensive monitoring and alerting.

### 1.3 Project Objectives

* **Automate monthly backups:** Achieve 100% automation of the monthly backup process within one month of project completion.
* **Implement incremental/differential backups:** Reduce backup storage space by 75% within two months of project completion.
* **Ensure data integrity:** Achieve a 99.99% success rate for data integrity checks on all backups within one month of project completion.
* **Implement secure storage:** Store backups in immutable blob storage with AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS encryption in transit within one month of project completion.
* **Enable automated recovery testing:** Successfully restore a full system backup in a sandbox environment within 90 minutes, with a success rate of 100% within one month of project completion.
* **Implement monitoring and alerting:** Configure alerts for backup failures, delays, and storage threshold breaches within one month of project completion.

## 2. Project Deliverables

### 2.1 Primary Deliverables

* **Automated Backup Script:** A fully functional and tested script (e.g., PowerShell, Python) to automate the monthly backup process.  This script will include features for scheduling, incremental/differential backups, and data integrity checks.
* **Secure Storage Configuration:** Configuration of a secure storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy) with encryption at rest and in transit.
* **Automated Recovery Test Script:** A script to automate the restoration of backups in a sandbox environment.
* **Monitoring and Alerting System:** Integration with a monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor) to track backup status and generate alerts for failures or delays.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Documentation detailing the setup, configuration, and usage of the automated backup system.

### 2.2 Secondary Deliverables

* **Training Materials:**  A brief training document for system administrators on the operation and maintenance of the automated backup system.

### 2.3 Deliverable Acceptance Criteria

* **Automated Backup Script:** The script must successfully complete a full backup and a differential backup without errors in a test environment.  The script must adhere to defined scheduling parameters.
* **Secure Storage Configuration:** The configured storage solution must meet the specified security requirements (encryption, immutability, etc.) and successfully store a test backup.
* **Automated Recovery Test Script:** The script must successfully restore a full system backup within the defined timeframe (90 minutes) in the sandbox environment.
* **Monitoring and Alerting System:** The monitoring system must accurately track backup status and generate alerts for predefined failure scenarios.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** The documentation must be clear, concise, and cover all aspects of system setup, configuration, and usage.  It must be reviewed and approved by the stakeholders.
* **Training Materials:** The training materials must be reviewed and approved by the stakeholders. They must be easily understandable and cover the essential aspects of the new system.

## 3. Scope Boundaries

### 3.1 In Scope

* Automated monthly backup scheduling.
* Incremental/differential backup implementation.
* Data integrity checks (checksum validation).
* Secure storage in immutable blob storage with encryption.
* Metadata tagging and categorization.
* Automated recovery testing in a sandbox environment.
* Monitoring and alerting integration.
* Documentation and training materials.

### 3.2 Out of Scope

* Development of new backup software.  This project focuses on automating the *existing* backup process.
* Migration of existing data to a new storage system.  This project assumes the use of existing data storage mechanisms.
* Integration with third-party backup applications.
* Disaster recovery planning beyond the scope of automated backups (e.g., site failover).
* User interface development.  This will be command-line driven.
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial implementation.

## 4. Project Constraints

* **Time Constraint:** The project must be completed within [Insert Project Timeline].
* **Budget Constraint:** The project budget is limited to [Insert Budget].
* **Resource Constraint:**  Available resources include [List Resources].
* **Technical Constraint:**  The project is constrained by the existing infrastructure and software versions.


---

## 5. Project Assumptions

* The existing backup process is well-documented.
* Necessary access permissions to all required systems and data are available.
* The chosen cloud storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage) will meet performance requirements.
* Stakeholders will provide timely feedback and approvals.

## 6. Success Criteria and Acceptance Criteria

The project will be deemed successful if all primary deliverables are completed and meet their acceptance criteria.  Successful completion of the automated recovery test will be a key indicator of success.  A post-implementation review will assess the reduction in backup storage space and downtime.  The project will be considered a success if the objectives outlined in Section 1.3 are met.

## 7. Stakeholder Communication

Regular updates will be provided to stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.  Key milestones and decision points will be communicated proactively.  A formal sign-off will be obtained upon project completion.
