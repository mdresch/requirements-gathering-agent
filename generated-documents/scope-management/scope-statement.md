# Project Scope Statement: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Generated by:** Requirements Gathering Agent v2.1.3
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Introduction

This Project Scope Statement defines the boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA aims to revolutionize project documentation by leveraging AI to generate comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents from project context, including README files and associated documentation. This statement serves as the basis for scope management and change control throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the ADPA project is to deliver a robust, AI-powered tool that significantly reduces the time and effort required to create project documentation while ensuring adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Specific objectives include:

* **Reduce documentation creation time by 75%:**  Achieved by automating the generation of 29 PMBOK documents and 10 specialized technical design documents.
* **Improve documentation accuracy by 90%:**  Ensured through AI-powered content generation and PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation.
* **Increase stakeholder alignment by 80%:** Facilitated by providing clear, consistent, and comprehensive documentation.
* **Achieve 95% PMBOK 7.0 compliance:**  Validated through automated compliance checks and quality assessments.
* **Maintain a 99% uptime for the application:** Guaranteed through robust error handling and system monitoring.

## 3. Project Deliverables

The ADPA project will deliver the following:

**3.1 Core Deliverables:**

* **Automated Documentation Generator Application:** A fully functional Node.js/TypeScript application capable of generating PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents and technical design documents.  This includes a robust CLI interface with comprehensive command-line options.
* **Comprehensive PMBOK Document Suite (29 Documents):**  All documents will be generated in markdown format and organized into a professional directory structure.  These documents include, but are not limited to: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Communication Management Plan, etc.
* **AI-Powered Technical Design Document Suite (10 Documents):**  Documents will include Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, and Error Handling.
* **Strategic Business Communication Documents:**  Including Purpose Statement, Company Values, Mission & Vision statements.
* **Enhanced Project Analysis Engine:**  An intelligent system for discovering and analyzing project documentation beyond the README file, including requirements, architecture, stakeholder information, planning documents, and more.  This engine will score and prioritize documentation sources based on relevance to PMBOK standards.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:** A system that optimizes context utilization for various Large Language Models (LLMs), including Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4, and Claude.
* **Version Control System for Generated Documents:**  A built-in Git repository to track changes and provide a full audit trail for generated documents.


**3.2 Secondary Deliverables:**

* **Comprehensive User Documentation:**  Including installation guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting documentation.
* **API Documentation:**  Detailed documentation for integrating ADPA with other systems.
* **Test Suite:**  A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.


**3.3 Deliverable Acceptance Criteria:**

Each deliverable will be considered complete and accepted when it meets the following criteria:

* **Functionality:** All features specified in the requirements are implemented and function correctly.
* **Performance:** The application meets performance requirements defined in the non-functional requirements.
* **Quality:** The code is well-documented, adheres to coding standards, and passes all tests.
* **Compliance:** Generated documents adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards and any relevant regulatory requirements.
* **Usability:** The CLI interface is intuitive and easy to use.
* **Security:** The application is secure and protects sensitive data.
