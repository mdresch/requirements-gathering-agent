## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop and deploy a production-ready API, the "ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent," that leverages AI to generate BABOK v3-compliant enterprise business analysis frameworks.  The API will drastically reduce the time and effort required for requirements elicitation, stakeholder analysis, and regulatory compliance integration in large-scale projects.  This will result in significant cost savings and improved efficiency for enterprise clients.  The system will be validated against Fortune 500-level scenarios and will be designed for scalability and ease of use.
