## 1. Introduction

This Project Scope Statement defines the boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA aims to revolutionize project documentation by leveraging AI to generate comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents from existing project context. This statement serves as the basis for scope management and change control throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the ADPA project is to deliver a robust, AI-powered tool that automates the generation of high-quality project management documentation, significantly reducing manual effort and improving consistency.  Specific objectives include:

* **Automate PMBOK 7.0 Document Generation:**  Generate at least 29 PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents (including Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc.) with high accuracy and completeness.
* **Enhance Contextual Understanding:**  Intelligently analyze diverse project data sources (README, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information) to generate context-rich documentation.
* **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Integrate with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama, providing flexibility and fallback options.
* **Develop a User-Friendly CLI:** Provide a command-line interface for easy access and batch processing of document generation.
* **Ensure PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:**  Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing detailed compliance reports and recommendations.
* **Achieve 95% Accuracy in Document Generation:**  Generated documents should be at least 95% accurate and free of major factual errors.
* **Achieve 90% User Satisfaction:**  Based on feedback from a minimum of 10 beta testers.
* **Implement a Version Control System:** Track changes to generated documents using Git for auditing and traceability.

## 3. Project Deliverables

The ADPA project will deliver the following:

* **ADPA Software Application:** A fully functional, tested, and documented Node.js/TypeScript application capable of generating PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents.  This includes a comprehensive CLI, error handling, and modular architecture.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** User guides, technical documentation, API documentation, and a detailed implementation guide.
* **Technical Design Documents:** A suite of 10 specialized technical documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, etc.), generated using dedicated AI prompts.
* **Strategic Business Documents:**  Purpose Statement, Company Values, and other executive-ready strategic communications.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Document Set:** A complete set of at least 29 PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents, generated automatically from project context.
* **Deployment Package:** A readily deployable package for various environments (e.g., Docker image).
* **Test Suite:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests demonstrating functionality and compliance.


### 3.1 Deliverable Acceptance Criteria

Each deliverable will meet the following acceptance criteria:

* **Functionality:** All features described in the user stories and project requirements are implemented correctly and perform as expected.
* **Performance:** The application performs within acceptable response times and resource utilization limits under various load conditions.
* **Security:** The application adheres to industry best practices for security and data protection.
* **Compliance:** Generated documents comply with PMBOK 7.0 standards and any relevant regulatory requirements.
