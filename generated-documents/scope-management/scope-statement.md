# Project Scope Statement: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) v2.2.0

**Generated by:** Requirements Gathering Agent v2.2.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Category:** Scope Management
**Description:** PMBOK 7.0 compliant Project Scope Statement for the Requirements Gathering Agent.


## 1. Project Scope Description

### 1.1 Project Purpose and Justification

This project aims to develop and deploy the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  The RGA addresses the need for efficient and consistent documentation creation, reducing manual effort and improving project planning accuracy.  This will lead to improved project delivery, reduced risk, and increased stakeholder satisfaction. The international footprint and legislative compliance requirements of the parent banking organization necessitate a robust and adaptable documentation system.

### 1.2 Product Scope Description

The RGA will be a command-line interface (CLI) application capable of generating various PMBOK-compliant project documents, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, work breakdown structures, and compliance documentation. The system will integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) offering flexibility and redundancy.  The generated documents will be in validated JSON format for interoperability.  The project also includes user documentation and training materials.

### 1.3 Project Objectives

*   Develop a functional RGA capable of generating at least six different PMBOK-compliant documents with 99% accuracy based on provided input.
*   Achieve an average document generation time of under 60 seconds for standard-sized projects.
*   Achieve a user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars based on feedback from 10 internal beta testers.
*   Successfully integrate with at least three different AI providers.
*   Deploy the RGA to a production environment within 6 months.


## 2. Project Deliverables

### 2.1 Primary Deliverables

*   **Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) Application:** A fully functional CLI application meeting all functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Comprehensive User Documentation:**  User manuals, tutorials, and FAQs covering all aspects of RGA usage.
*   **Deployment Package:** A readily deployable package for the RGA application, including all necessary dependencies and configuration files.

### 2.2 Secondary Deliverables

*   **API Documentation:** Swagger-compliant API documentation for internal and external use (if applicable).
*   **Unit and Integration Tests:** A comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests demonstrating code quality and functionality.

### 2.3 Deliverable Acceptance Criteria

*   **RGA Application:**  Successfully generates six PMBOK-compliant documents (project charter, stakeholder register, scope management plan, risk management plan, work breakdown structure, compliance documentation) with 99% accuracy based on predefined test cases.  Average generation time under 60 seconds.  All unit and integration tests pass.
*   **User Documentation:**  User feedback indicates clarity and ease of use (4.5/5 stars average rating from 10 beta testers).
*   **Deployment Package:**  Successfully deploys and runs in the target production environment.


## 3. Scope Boundaries

### 3.1 In Scope

*   Development of the core RGA application functionality, including AI provider integration and document generation.
*   Creation of user documentation and training materials.
*   Development and execution of unit and integration tests.
*   Deployment of the RGA application to a production environment.
*   Support for OpenAI, Google AI, and Azure OpenAI initially.  Additional providers may be added in future releases.


### 3.2 Out of Scope

*   Integration with third-party project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).  This may be considered in future releases.
*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).  CLI focus for initial release.
*   Implementation of advanced security features beyond basic authentication and authorization (JWT & API Keys). This is addressed in a separate project.
*   Support for regulatory compliance beyond basic data privacy and security.  This is addressed in a separate project.


## 4. Project Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

*   Generate PMBOK-compliant project documents (see Deliverables).
*   Integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).
*   Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
*   Support template-based document creation.
*   Validate generated document output against PMBOK standards.


### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

*   Performance: Average document generation time under 60 seconds.
*   Usability: Intuitive and easy-to-use CLI.
*   Maintainability: Clean, well-documented, and modular codebase.
*   Scalability:  Able to handle varying project sizes and complexities.
*   Security: Secure authentication and authorization using JWT and API keys.


### 4.3 Quality Requirements

*   Code coverage of at least 80% for unit tests.
*   All generated documents must adhere to PMBOK standards.
*   User documentation must receive an average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars from beta testers.


## 5. Project Constraints

### 5.1 Technical Constraints

## 8. Organizational Completion Instructions

This scope statement requires review and completion of the resource constraint sections (budget, timeline, personnel) and validation of assumptions by relevant stakeholders.  A scope validation workshop is recommended before initiating project execution.  A formal change control process will be established to manage any scope changes during the project lifecycle.
