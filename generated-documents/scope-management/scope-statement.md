- Out-of-the-box generation of documentation aligned with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7, and DMBOK 2.0
- Modular architecture supporting plugin-based enterprise integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services)
- Enterprise-grade authentication (Microsoft Entra ID) and secure AI provider management
- Multi-channel user interfaces: CLI, REST API, and Web Admin Portal

### 1.3 Project Objectives

- **Automate generation of professional, standards-compliant business and project documentation**
- **Enable secure, scalable integration with enterprise systems** for document storage, management, and workflow automation
- **Support multi-provider AI orchestration** with failover and provider prioritization
- **Ensure regulatory compliance and data security** (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.)
