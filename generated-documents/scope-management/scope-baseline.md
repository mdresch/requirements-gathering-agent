# Scope Baseline: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the Scope Baseline for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project.  It outlines the approved project scope, work breakdown structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary, forming the foundation for scope management and control throughout the project lifecycle.  This baseline will be used to track progress, manage changes, and ensure the successful delivery of the ADPA framework.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

This project aims to deliver a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.  ADPA will provide CLI and REST API interfaces, generating professional documentation adhering to BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 standards.  The framework will integrate with multiple AI providers, enterprise systems (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services), and offer robust security and compliance features.

### 2.1 Product Scope:

* **Core Functionality:** AI-powered document generation based on specified templates and frameworks (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0).  Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) with automatic failover.  CLI and REST API interfaces.  Admin web interface for management and monitoring.
* **Integrations:**  Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services integrations.  Future integrations to be defined in subsequent scope change requests.
* **Document Types:**  A comprehensive library of document templates covering key aspects of business analysis, project management, and data management.  (Specific document types listed in Appendix A).
* **Security & Compliance:**  Enterprise-grade security features including robust authentication and authorization, adhering to relevant regulations (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS).
* **Scalability:**  Designed for large-scale enterprise deployments with horizontal scaling capabilities.

### 2.2 Project Scope:

* **Development:**  Building the core framework, including the AI engine, document generator, API server, CLI, admin interface, and integrations.
* **Testing:**  Comprehensive unit, integration, and performance testing.
* **Documentation:**  Creating comprehensive user documentation, API specifications, and internal technical documentation.
* **Deployment:**  Deployment to a production environment (specific environment to be defined).
* **Project Management:**  All standard project management activities, including planning, execution, monitoring, and control.

### 2.3  Acceptance Criteria:

* **Functional Acceptance:**  All core features and integrations operate as specified in the functional requirements document (Appendix B).
* **Performance Acceptance:**  The system meets defined performance benchmarks for document generation speed, API response times, and overall system stability (Appendix C).
* **Security Acceptance:**  Successful completion of a security audit demonstrating compliance with defined security standards.
* **Compliance Acceptance:**  Verification of compliance with relevant regulatory requirements.
* **User Acceptance:**  Successful completion of user acceptance testing with positive feedback from key stakeholders.

## 4. WBS Dictionary

(This section would contain a detailed table with the following columns for each work package identified in the WBS above):

* **Work Package ID:**  Unique identifier for each work package.
* **Work Package Description:**  Detailed description of the work to be performed.
* **Responsible Party:**  Individual or team responsible for the work package.
* **Estimated Duration:**  Estimated time required to complete the work package.
* **Estimated Cost:**  Estimated cost associated with the work package.
* **Dependencies:**  List of predecessor and successor work packages.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific criteria for accepting the completed work package.


## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change control process.  This process includes:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  Formal submission of a change request detailing the proposed change, rationale, and impact assessment.
2. **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluation of the impact of the proposed change on schedule, cost, resources, and risks.
3. **Change Approval:**  Review and approval by the appropriate stakeholders.
4. **Baseline Update:**  Update of the scope baseline to reflect approved changes.
5. **Communication:**  Notification of all affected parties of the approved change and its implications.

## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification and validation activities will be performed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that the ADPA framework meets the defined requirements and acceptance criteria.  These activities will include:

* **Code Reviews:**  Regular code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
* **Unit Testing:**  Testing individual components of the system.
* **Integration Testing:**  Testing the interaction between different components of the system.
* **System Testing:**  Testing the entire system to ensure it meets the defined requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by end-users to ensure the system meets their needs.
