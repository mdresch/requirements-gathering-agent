# Scope Baseline  
**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 3.2.4  
**Date:** 2024-06-30

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Baseline establishes the agreed-upon scope for the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project. It consists of the approved Project Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and WBS Dictionary. The baseline serves as the foundation for all scope planning, execution, verification, and change control throughout the project lifecycle. ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation platform for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis, fully aligned with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.
