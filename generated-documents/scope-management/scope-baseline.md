# Scope Baseline: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope baseline for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This baseline encompasses the approved project scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary.  It serves as the foundation for managing and controlling the project scope throughout its lifecycle. The project's unique focus on generating enterprise-grade BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks in real-time necessitates a detailed scope definition to ensure successful delivery.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

The primary deliverable is a production-ready Express.js API that generates BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks based on input data.  This API will:

* **Automate Requirements Elicitation:** Generate comprehensive BABOK frameworks in seconds, significantly reducing manual effort.
* **Support Enterprise-Scale Projects:** Handle complex organizational structures and large datasets.
* **Integrate Regulatory Compliance:** Automatically incorporate relevant regulations (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* **Provide Multi-Format Output:** Generate deliverables in PDF, DOCX, and HTML formats.
* **Maintain API-First Design:** Utilize TypeSpec for robust API specifications and OpenAPI 3.0 generation.
* **Incorporate Enterprise-Grade Security:** Implement authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling.


### 2.2 Project Scope:

This project encompasses the design, development, testing, deployment, and documentation of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API.  Specific activities include:

* **API Design and Development:**  Implementing the API using Express.js, TypeScript, and relevant libraries.
* **TypeSpec Integration:** Defining and maintaining API specifications using TypeSpec.
* **Data Processing and Framework Generation:** Developing algorithms and logic for framework generation based on the BABOK v3 methodology.
* **Regulatory Compliance Integration:** Integrating relevant regulatory frameworks into the framework generation process.
* **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Conducting unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure API functionality and performance.
* **Deployment and Infrastructure Setup:** Deploying the API to a production-ready environment.
* **Documentation Creation:** Developing comprehensive API documentation and user guides.


### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria:

The project will be considered complete when:

* The API successfully generates accurate and complete BABOK v3 compliant frameworks within defined performance benchmarks (e.g., <2 seconds for Fortune 500-scale datasets).
* All planned API endpoints function correctly and meet defined performance requirements.
* The API meets security requirements and passes all security audits.
* Comprehensive documentation, including API specifications and user guides, is available.
* The API successfully passes all defined acceptance tests and receives stakeholder sign-off.


## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

This WBS utilizes a hierarchical structure to decompose the project into manageable work packages.

    * 3.2 MiFID II Compliance
    * 3.3 GDPR Compliance
    * 3.4 SOX Compliance


## 4. WBS Dictionary

A detailed WBS dictionary will be created, outlining each work package's description, assigned team member(s), estimated duration, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.  This dictionary will be maintained and updated throughout the project lifecycle.


## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the scope baseline will be managed through a formal change control process, including change request submission, impact assessment, approval, implementation, and communication.  Regular scope reviews will be conducted to monitor progress and identify potential scope creep.


## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification activities will focus on ensuring that the deliverables meet the specified requirements. Validation will confirm that the deliverables meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  This will involve rigorous testing, code reviews, and stakeholder sign-off.


## 7. Baseline Maintenance

The scope baseline will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect approved changes.  Version control will be implemented to track changes and maintain a clear audit trail.  All stakeholders will be kept informed of any significant changes to the scope baseline.


This Scope Baseline serves as a living document and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any deviations from this baseline will be formally documented and managed through the established change control process.
