# Scope Baseline: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Baseline document defines the approved scope for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project. It serves as the foundation for managing and controlling the project's scope throughout its lifecycle.  This baseline incorporates the project's evolution beyond simple document generation to include sophisticated business communication translation and a comprehensive technical design document system.  The baseline is aligned with PMBOK 7.0 best practices and reflects the project's self-authorized inception and ongoing development.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

This project aims to develop and deliver the ADPA, a robust, AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool capable of generating comprehensive project management documentation adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  The tool leverages multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and incorporates an advanced context management system for superior accuracy and relevance.  Beyond PMBOK document generation, ADPA now includes:

**Product Scope:**

* **Core PMBOK Documentation:** Generation of a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc., as detailed in the project README).
* **Technical Design Document System:**  Generation of ten types of technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, Error Handling).
* **Business Communication Translation:** Generation of strategic business documents such as Company Values, Purpose Statements, and Mission/Vision statements, reflecting the project's context.
* **Enhanced Context Management System:** A three-phase context strategy maximizing the utilization of large language models (LLMs) and incorporating multiple relevant project documents beyond the README.
* **Version Control System (VCS):**  Built-in version control for all generated documents, enabling tracking of changes and collaboration.
* **Modular Processor Architecture:**  A flexible architecture enabling easy addition and extension of document generation capabilities.
* **Multi-Provider Support:**  Flexibility to select and switch between multiple AI providers via CLI or config.

**Project Scope:**

* Development of the ADPA CLI tool (including core functionality, AI integration, context management, and VCS).
* Comprehensive testing and quality assurance, including PMBOK compliance validation.
* Development of user documentation, tutorials, and training materials.
* Ongoing maintenance and support for the tool.

**Exclusions:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (future enhancement).
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) (future enhancement).
* Support for non-markdown input formats (future enhancement).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Successful generation of all specified document types according to PMBOK 7.0 standards and specified templates.
* Achievement of specified performance benchmarks (context utilization, generation speed).
* Successful completion of all testing and quality assurance procedures.
* Positive stakeholder feedback and formal sign-off.

## 5. Baseline Control, Verification, Validation & Maintenance

Standard change control procedures (as defined in the project's Change Management Plan) will be followed for any scope changes.  Regular reviews of the scope baseline will be conducted to ensure alignment with project progress and stakeholder expectations.  Verification will involve technical reviews and testing; validation will be through stakeholder acceptance and UAT.  The baseline will be updated formally through the change control process.


## 6. Conclusion

This Scope Baseline provides a clear and concise definition of the approved scope for the ADPA project.  Adherence to this baseline is crucial for successful project delivery.  Any proposed changes must follow the established change control process.
