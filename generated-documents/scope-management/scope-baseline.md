# Scope Baseline: Project Backup Vermigerous

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope baseline for Project Backup Vermigerous, outlining the deliverables, activities, and acceptance criteria for automating and securing the monthly backup process.  This baseline serves as the foundation for managing and controlling the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  Any changes to this baseline will be managed through a formal change control process.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

**2.1 Product Scope:**  The primary deliverable is a fully automated, secure, and verifiable monthly backup system for Project Vermigerous. This system will create incremental or differential backups, categorized by year and month, ensuring sufficient data is available for restoration after a system failure.  Backups will be stored securely, with integrity checks implemented to verify data validity.  Automated recovery testing will be implemented to validate the restoration process.

**2.2 Project Scope:** This project encompasses the design, development, implementation, testing, and deployment of the automated backup system.  This includes:

* **Design:** Defining the backup strategy (incremental/differential), storage architecture (including encryption and location), metadata tagging, and recovery testing procedures.
* **Development:** Creating scripts (e.g., PowerShell, cron jobs, Azure Automation) to automate the backup process, including validation and integrity checks.
* **Implementation:** Configuring the chosen backup solution and integrating it with existing systems.
* **Testing:** Performing unit, integration, and system testing to validate the functionality and reliability of the automated backup system, including automated recovery tests.
* **Deployment:** Deploying the solution to the production environment.
* **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive documentation, including user guides and technical specifications.

**2.3 Acceptance Criteria:** The project will be considered complete when:

* The automated backup system successfully creates monthly backups categorized by year and month.
* Backup integrity is verified through checksum validation (e.g., SHA-256).
* Backups are stored securely using encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS).
* Automated recovery testing successfully restores data from backups in a sandbox environment.
* Comprehensive documentation is available.
* The system consistently meets performance requirements (defined in Appendix A - Performance Requirements).
* The system meets security requirements (defined in Appendix B - Security Requirements).

## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the scope baseline will be managed using a formal change control process (detailed in Appendix D).  This process involves submitting a change request, assessing the impact of the change, obtaining approval, updating the baseline, and communicating the change to stakeholders.

## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification activities will ensure that the project deliverables conform to the defined requirements. This will include code reviews, testing, and security audits. Validation will ensure that the deliverables meet the needs and expectations of the stakeholders. This will include user acceptance testing and a formal sign-off process.
