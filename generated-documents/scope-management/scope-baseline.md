# Scope Baseline: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Baseline document defines the approved scope for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project. It serves as the foundation for managing and controlling project scope throughout its lifecycle, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and PMBOK 7.0 best practices.  This baseline incorporates the successful completion of the project's strategic inception phase, including the generation of a Project Charter authorizing its own existence.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

ADPA is an AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive project management documentation based on provided project context (primarily README files but also leveraging additional project documentation).  The generated documentation adheres to PMBOK 7.0 standards and includes, but is not limited to:

* **Core Project Documents:** Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Project Scope Statement, Business Case, Requirements Documentation.
* **Planning Documents:** Scope Management Plan, Requirements Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, Quality Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Communications Management Plan, Procurement Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule Network Diagram, Milestone List.
* **Technical Design Documents:** Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, Error Handling.
* **Strategic Business Communications:** Purpose Statement, Company Values, Mission & Vision statements.


The tool supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and features an enhanced context manager to optimize AI performance and document accuracy.  It also includes a built-in version control system for generated documents.  The output is primarily in Markdown format, organized into a structured directory for easy navigation.

### 2.2 Project Scope:

The project scope encompasses the development, testing, and deployment of the ADPA tool, including:

* **Software Development:**  Coding, testing, debugging, and refinement of the ADPA application using TypeScript and Node.js.
* **AI Integration:**  Implementation of robust and secure APIs for integration with chosen AI providers.
* **Context Management:**  Development and refinement of the context management system, including intelligent source discovery and relevance scoring.
* **Document Generation:**  Creation of templates and algorithms for generating PMBOK-compliant documentation.
* **CLI Development:**  Building a user-friendly command-line interface for seamless interaction.
* **Version Control System Integration:** Implementing and testing the built-in VCS for generated documents.
* **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and troubleshooting guides.
* **Testing and Quality Assurance:**  Rigorous testing to ensure accuracy, functionality, and PMBOK compliance.


### 2.3 Exclusions:

* **Custom Template Development:**  While the tool allows for configuration, custom template creation beyond the provided templates is outside the scope.
* **Third-Party Tool Integration:**  Direct integration with external project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana) is not included in this phase.
* **Ongoing Maintenance and Support beyond initial release:** This is considered a separate project phase.
* **Training and Consulting Services:**  Providing training or consulting services on ADPA usage is outside the scope.


### 2.4 Acceptance Criteria:

* Successful generation of all documented document types in the specified formats, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* Functional CLI with all documented commands.
* Robust error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
* Comprehensive user documentation and tutorials.
* Successful completion of all planned testing phases, achieving pre-defined quality metrics.
* Stakeholder sign-off on generated documents (for example documents).
* Successful deployment to npm.


## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

(A detailed WBS would be included here, breaking down the project into manageable work packages.  Due to the complexity and length, a simplified example is provided below. A full WBS would be a separate document.)

**3.1 Level 1:**  Develop ADPA Tool

**3.2 Level 2:**
* Develop Core Functionality
* Develop AI Provider Integration
* Develop Context Management System
* Develop Document Generation Engine
* Develop CLI Interface
* Develop Version Control System Integration
* Develop User Documentation
* Test and Quality Assurance
* Deployment to npm

**3.3 Level 3:** (Further breakdown of Level 2 items into individual tasks would be included here.)


## 4. WBS Dictionary

(A comprehensive WBS dictionary would be included here, detailing each work package with its description, assigned resources, estimated duration, and dependencies.  This would be a separate, extensive document.)


## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the scope will be managed through a formal change control process, documented in a separate Change Management Plan.  This process will involve:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  Formal submission of change requests with justification.
2. **Impact Assessment:** Evaluation of the impact of the change request on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
3. **Change Approval:** Review and approval by relevant stakeholders.
4. **Baseline Update:**  Update of the Scope Baseline to reflect approved changes.
5. **Communication:**  Notification of all affected parties of the approved changes.


## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification and validation will be performed throughout the project lifecycle, utilizing:

* **Code Reviews:** Regular code reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
* **Unit Testing:**  Testing individual components of the application to ensure functionality.
* **Integration Testing:**  Testing the interaction between different components of the application.
* **System Testing:**  Testing the entire application to ensure it meets requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by end-users to validate the usability and functionality of the application.
* **PMBOK Compliance Checks:**  Verification that generated documents comply with PMBOK 7.0 standards.


## 7. Baseline Maintenance

The Scope Baseline will be regularly reviewed and updated as necessary, reflecting approved changes and incorporating lessons learned.  Version control will be maintained using Git.


This Scope Baseline document provides a high-level overview.  More detailed documentation, including the complete WBS and WBS dictionary, Change Management Plan, and other relevant plans, will be maintained as separate project artifacts.
