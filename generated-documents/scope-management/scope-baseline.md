# Scope Baseline: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, version 2.2.0.  It serves as the primary reference for managing project scope throughout the lifecycle and ensures alignment between stakeholders.  The RGA project aims to deliver a revolutionary AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  This baseline explicitly excludes security features as detailed in the project requirements.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

The RGA will deliver a command-line interface (CLI) tool capable of generating the following PMBOK-compliant documents:

* Project Charters
* Stakeholder Registers
* Scope Management Plans
* Risk Management Plans
* Work Breakdown Structures (WBS)
* Compliance Documentation (excluding security-related compliance)

The tool will support multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) and offer template-based document creation for customization and consistency.  The output will be in validated JSON format for interoperability.  User documentation and tutorials will be provided.

### 2.2 Project Scope:

This project encompasses the development, testing, and deployment of the RGA CLI tool, including:

* Software development (using TypeScript and Node.js)
* Unit and integration testing
* Development of user documentation
* Initial deployment to a designated environment (details to be defined in a separate deployment plan)

**Excluded from this scope:**

* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI)
* Integration with third-party project management tools (future enhancement)
* Implementation of any security features (explicitly excluded per project requirements)
*  Support for regulatory compliance beyond basic documentation generation.


### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria:

The RGA will be considered complete and accepted when:

* All functional requirements (as detailed in `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` and `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`) are met.
* Unit and integration tests achieve 95% code coverage with 100% pass rate.
* User documentation is complete and approved by the documentation team.
* The tool successfully generates accurate and complete PMBOK-compliant documents based on provided input.
* A successful deployment to the designated environment is completed.

## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the scope baseline will be managed through a formal change control process documented in a separate Change Management Plan.  All change requests will be evaluated for impact on schedule, budget, and resources. Approved changes will be formally documented and incorporated into the baseline.


## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification will be achieved through code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, and technical documentation reviews. Validation will be conducted through user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the tool meets user needs and produces the expected outputs.


## 7. Baseline Maintenance

The scope baseline will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect approved changes and ensure accuracy.  Version control will be maintained using Git.  All updates will be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
