# Scope Baseline: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope baseline for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It outlines the approved project scope, deliverables, and acceptance criteria, serving as the foundation for managing and controlling the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  This project aims to revolutionize enterprise business analysis by automating the generation of BABOK v3 compliant frameworks in seconds, leveraging AI and an API-first architecture.  The unique aspect of this project is its focus on delivering Fortune 500 grade deliverables with a focus on both technical excellence and artistic achievement in software development.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

The primary deliverable is a production-ready, scalable, and secure Express.js API that generates BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  Key features include:

* **Real-time Framework Generation:**  Automatic generation of comprehensive BABOK v3 frameworks based on input data.
* **Multi-Provider AI Integration:**  Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) for enhanced flexibility and resilience.
* **Stakeholder Ecosystem Mapping:** AI-powered analysis of complex organizational structures to identify key stakeholders and their influence.
* **Regulatory Compliance Integration:** Automatic incorporation of relevant regulations (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, etc.).
* **Multi-Format Output:** Generation of deliverables in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Robust security measures including authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Detailed API documentation, user guides, and example outputs.


### 2.2 Project Scope:

This project encompasses the following activities:

* **API Development:** Design, development, testing, and deployment of the Express.js API.
* **AI Integration:** Integration with chosen AI providers and development of AI interaction logic.
* **Data Processing:** Development of robust data processing and validation components.
* **Document Generation:**  Development of document generation engine using templates and AI-generated content.
* **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive testing of the API and its functionalities.
* **Deployment and Infrastructure:** Setting up and configuring the necessary infrastructure for API deployment.
* **Documentation Creation:**  Development of comprehensive user documentation and API specifications.


### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria:

The project will be considered complete when:

* The API successfully generates BABOK v3 compliant frameworks within the defined performance benchmarks (less than 2 seconds for Fortune 500-scale datasets).
* All API endpoints function as specified in the API documentation, with comprehensive error handling.
* The API meets all security and performance requirements.
* The generated documents are validated against the BABOK v3 standard and meet the defined quality criteria.
* All documentation is complete and accurate.
* Stakeholder acceptance is achieved through successful demonstration and validation.

## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change control process, documented in a separate Change Management Plan. This process includes change request submission, impact assessment, approval by relevant stakeholders, and updates to the scope baseline.  Regular project reviews will monitor scope adherence and identify any potential deviations.

## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification will be performed through code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, and security testing. Validation will be conducted through user acceptance testing (UAT) with representative stakeholders and a final demonstration of the system's capabilities.

## 7. Baseline Maintenance

The scope baseline will be maintained and updated as needed through the formal change control process.  Regular reviews will ensure that the baseline remains accurate and reflects the current project status.  Version control will be implemented to track changes and maintain a history of the scope baseline.


This Scope Baseline document will be reviewed and approved by the project stakeholders before project commencement.  Any changes to this baseline will require formal approval through the established change control process.
