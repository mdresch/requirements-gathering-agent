# Scope Baseline: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It defines the project scope, work breakdown structure (WBS), and the process for managing changes to the scope.  This baseline serves as the foundation for managing project expectations and controlling scope creep.  The unique aspect of this project is its self-directed inception and ongoing self-improvement through AI-driven analysis and generation.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation conforming to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Key features include:

* **Comprehensive PMBOK Document Suite:**  Generation of at least 29 PMBOK-compliant documents (including, but not limited to, Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Stakeholder Register, WBS, etc.).
* **Contextual Reasoning:**  Intelligent synthesis of information from various sources, including the project README, related markdown files, and other identified project documentation.  This includes reasoning about organizational authority structures and resolving conflicting information.
* **Hierarchical Authority Recognition:**  Ability to understand and incorporate organizational authority structures into document generation, prioritizing information based on source authority.
* **Multiple AI Provider Support:**  Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) with fallback mechanisms for increased reliability.
* **Modular Architecture:**  Extensible architecture enabling future expansion of document types and AI integrations.
* **Technical Design Document System:** Generation of 10 specialized technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, Error Handling).
* **Strategic Business Communication Translation:**  Generation of strategic business documents (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.) from technical project context.
* **Version Control System:**  Built-in version control system for generated documents.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  User-friendly CLI for document generation, configuration, and version control.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:**  Intelligent 3-phase context strategy for optimizing context utilization across various AI models, including ultra-large models (up to 90% utilization).
* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Automated discovery and analysis of project documentation beyond the README.md file.

### 2.2 Project Scope:

The project includes all activities necessary to develop, test, deploy, and document ADPA, including:

* **Software Development:**  Coding, testing, and debugging of the ADPA application.
* **AI Model Integration:**  Integration with chosen AI providers and continuous optimization of AI prompts and context management.
* **Documentation Creation:**  Development of user guides, API documentation, and internal documentation.
* **Testing & Quality Assurance:**  Comprehensive testing to ensure PMBOK compliance and document quality.
* **Deployment & Release:**  Deployment of ADPA and release management.
* **Maintenance & Support:**  Ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and user support.


### 2.3 Exclusions:

The following are explicitly excluded from the project scope:

* Integration with third-party project management tools beyond initial testing and feasibility studies.
* Development of a full-fledged graphical user interface (GUI).
* Support for non-markdown document formats beyond initial testing and evaluation.
* Extensive customization of AI models beyond prompt engineering within the existing framework.
* Integration with specific enterprise security systems beyond Azure AD for authentication.


### 2.4 Acceptance Criteria:

The project will be considered complete when:

* All defined PMBOK documents are generated accurately and completely.
* The ADPA application successfully integrates with at least one AI provider and demonstrates expected functionality.
* All unit and integration tests pass successfully.
* User documentation is complete and readily available.
* Stakeholder acceptance is achieved through formal sign-off.
* The ADPA application demonstrates robust error handling and maintains data integrity.
* The Technical Design Document System generates complete and accurate technical specifications.


## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

This WBS utilizes a hierarchical structure to break down the project into manageable work packages.  Further detail can be found in the WBS Dictionary (Appendix A).

    2.2 AI Provider Integration
    2.3 Document Generation Engine
    2.4 CLI Interface
    2.5 Technical Design Document System
    2.6 Strategic Business Communication System
    2.7 Version Control System

**3.0 Testing & Quality Assurance**

## 4. WBS Dictionary (Appendix A)

*(This section would contain a detailed table outlining each work package within the WBS, including its description, assigned resources, estimated duration, dependencies, etc.)*  A sample entry is shown below:

| Work Package ID | Description                                      | Assigned Resources | Estimated Duration | Dependencies |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 2.1.1           | Develop Context Manager Core Logic                 | John Doe, Jane Smith | 2 weeks            | 1.1.1         |


## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the scope will be managed through a formal change control process:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  Stakeholders submit change requests via a designated form.
2. **Impact Assessment:**  The project manager assesses the impact of the change request on the schedule, budget, and resources.
3. **Change Approval:**  The change request is reviewed and approved or rejected by the appropriate stakeholders.
4. **Baseline Update:**  Approved changes are incorporated into the scope baseline, WBS, and other relevant documents.
5. **Communication:**  All stakeholders are notified of approved changes and their impact.


## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification and validation activities will be conducted throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that the deliverables meet the acceptance criteria and comply with PMBOK standards.  This includes regular reviews, inspections, and testing.


This Scope Baseline document will be formally reviewed and approved by the project stakeholders.  Any changes to this baseline will be managed through the change control process outlined above.
