# Scope Baseline: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) Project

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope baseline for the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project.  It outlines the project's objectives, deliverables, and the processes for managing and controlling the scope throughout the project lifecycle. This baseline will be used to track progress, manage changes, and ensure the project delivers the intended outcomes.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

The primary deliverable is a functional prototype of a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) demonstrating the integration of advanced photovoltaic body panels, a regenerative suspension system, a thermoelectric generation (TEG) system, and an AI-powered Energy Management Unit (EMU).  The prototype will demonstrate a measurable increase in vehicle range compared to a baseline electric vehicle without these energy harvesting systems.  Specific performance targets will be defined in subsequent documentation (e.g., range extension under various driving conditions and weather scenarios).  The prototype must meet all relevant safety and regulatory standards.

### 2.2 Project Scope:

This project encompasses the research, design, development, testing, and integration of the four core SCEV technologies:

* **Advanced Photovoltaic Body Panels:** Research, selection, and integration of high-efficiency solar cells into a lightweight, durable composite material for the vehicle body.
* **Regenerative Suspension System:** Design, development, and integration of linear electromagnetic generators into the vehicle's suspension system.
* **Thermoelectric Generation (TEG):** Design, development, and integration of TEG modules to harvest waste heat from the battery pack, electric motors, and radiator.
* **AI-Powered Energy Management Unit (EMU):** Development of software and hardware for the EMU, including algorithms for energy prediction, optimization, and user feedback.

The project also includes the development of a detailed digital twin for simulation and modeling, the retrofitting of an existing electric vehicle ("test mule") for real-world data collection, and the creation of comprehensive project documentation.  This excludes the design and manufacturing of a fully production-ready vehicle.

### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria:

The project will be considered complete when:

* A functional prototype demonstrating the integration of all four core technologies is successfully built and tested.
* The prototype achieves pre-defined performance targets for range extension under various conditions (specific targets to be defined in a separate Performance Baseline document).
* All safety and regulatory requirements are met.
* The project deliverables (prototype, documentation, data reports) are formally accepted by the project stakeholders.

## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change control process, including a change request form, impact assessment, approval by the Change Control Board, and updates to the baseline documentation.  A detailed change control process will be documented separately.


## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification will be ongoing throughout the project, involving regular technical reviews, testing, and inspections. Validation will occur at the end of the project through comprehensive testing of the prototype and formal acceptance by stakeholders.


## 7. Baseline Maintenance

The scope baseline will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect approved changes and maintain its accuracy.  Version control will be implemented to track all changes and maintain a history of the baseline.


This Scope Baseline provides a high-level overview.  More detailed information will be provided in subsequent project documentation.
