# Plan Scope Management  
**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-01-27

## 1. Introduction

This Plan Scope Management document establishes the formal approach for defining, validating, and controlling the scope of the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project. ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript framework that automates enterprise documentation in alignment with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. The scope management plan ensures all deliverables, requirements, and changes are systematically identified, validated, and controlled to support enterprise-grade deployments and regulatory compliance.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

### Methodology

- **Standards-Driven Scope Definition:** Leverage industry-standard frameworks (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, DMBOK 2.0) to inform, structure, and refine the project scope.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Employ an agile and incremental approach, enabling continuous scope clarification and adaptation based on evolving requirements and stakeholder feedback.
- **Stakeholder-Centric Validation:** Prioritize stakeholder engagement through iterative reviews, ensuring deliverables align with enterprise needs and compliance mandates.
- **Automated Scope Control:** Utilize ADPA’s integrated automation and analytics (including AI-powered monitoring and real-time compliance validation) for proactive scope oversight.

### Key Principles

- **Clear Scope Boundaries:** All functional and non-functional requirements, exclusions, and interfaces are explicitly documented.
- **Alignment with Enterprise Strategy:** Scope is mapped to organizational goals, regulatory standards, and technology strategies (e.g., security, compliance, integration).
- **Documented Acceptance Criteria:** Every deliverable includes measurable, agreed-upon acceptance criteria, aligned with target standards.
- **Change Governance:** Scope changes are managed through a structured, auditable process with automated impact analysis and approval workflows.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role              | Responsibilities                                                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager**   | - Accountable for scope definition, documentation, and change control<br>- Approves/rejects scope changes<br>- Coordinates stakeholder communications |
| **Business Analyst**  | - Leads requirements elicitation (workshops, interviews, document review)<br>- Documents and models scope<br>- Supports impact and gap analysis |
| **Technical Lead**    | - Translates business scope into technical designs<br>- Assesses technical feasibility and risks<br>- Validates scope against architecture |
| **QA Lead**           | - Validates deliverables against acceptance criteria<br>- Ensures traceability from requirements to tests |
| **Stakeholders**      | - Define, clarify, and validate requirements<br>- Review and accept/reject deliverables<br>- Initiate change requests |

## 4. Scope Definition Process

### Requirements Gathering

1. **Stakeholder Interviews:** Targeted sessions with enterprise architects, compliance leads, project managers, and end users.
2. **Workshops:** Collaborative requirements sessions focused on standards alignment (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK), integration needs, and automation objectives.
3. **Document Analysis:** Review of regulatory requirements (e.g., Basel III, GDPR, SOX), existing documentation processes, and technology stack.
4. **Prototyping Sessions:** Demonstrations and feedback cycles using ADPA’s CLI, API, and admin interfaces to refine scope and usability expectations.

### Scope Documentation

- **Scope Statement:** Comprehensive definition of included and excluded features, target frameworks, supported integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, etc.), and compliance objectives.
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Hierarchical decomposition of deliverables, including core modules (AI Processing Engine, Document Generator, REST API, CLI, Integration Layer, Admin Portal, Analytics).
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Measurable outcomes for each deliverable, aligned to regulatory, security, and standards-compliance requirements.
- **Assumptions and Constraints:** Documented dependencies (e.g., Node.js/TypeScript versions, AI provider availability), technology limitations, and enterprise integration prerequisites.

### Deliverable Examples

- Automated document generation modules (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK)
- REST API and CLI for standards-compliant documentation
- Integration adapters (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe)
- Security and authentication subsystems (Entra ID integration)
- Compliance automation and reporting features

## 5. Validation and Control

### Validation Methods

- **Formal Deliverable Reviews:** Structured walkthroughs with stakeholders to verify alignment with scope statement and acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholder Sign-Off:** Mandatory approval from key business and technical stakeholders at major milestones and for each major deliverable.
- **Quality Gate Assessments:** Integration of automated testing (Jest, TypeScript), standards validation, and compliance checks before release.

### Control Procedures

- **Change Request Workflow:** All scope changes are logged, assessed, and tracked using an auditable, automated workflow within the ADPA framework.
    - Change requests must include rationale, impact analysis (schedule, cost, compliance), and proposed adjustments to deliverables.
    - Automated impact analysis is leveraged where possible (AI-powered scope creep detection and PMBOK compliance scoring).
- **Approval Authority Matrix:** Defines escalation paths and approval authority for different change types (e.g., minor, major, regulatory-impacting).
- **Configuration Management:** All scope documents, requirements, and change records are version-controlled (GitHub) and centrally accessible.
- **Adaptive Scope Control:** Real-time monitoring and reporting of scope status, leveraging built-in analytics and AI to detect scope drift and emerging risks.

## 6. Tools, Techniques, and Integration

- **ADPA CLI & API:** For rapid requirements capture, documentation generation, and standards mapping.
- **Automated Analytics:** Real-time metrics and dashboards for scope compliance, progress, and risk.
- **Integration with Enterprise Platforms:** Streamlined publishing to Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe PDF services.
- **Version Control:** All scope artifacts maintained in GitHub with strict branch protection and review policies.

---

## 7. Unique Considerations for ADPA

- **Multi-Framework Compliance:** Scope is governed by the need to concurrently support BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0, requiring cross-referencing and harmonization of deliverables.
- **AI-Driven Automation:** Inclusion of intelligent context management, multi-provider AI orchestration, and automated compliance validation is a core part of project scope.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security & Compliance:** Scope includes Entra ID-based authentication, role-based access controls, and automated regulatory reporting (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.).
- **Extensible Architecture:** The scope must enable extensibility for future standards, integrations, and deployment models (Docker, Kubernetes).

---

## 8. Practical Guidance

- All requirements and scope changes should be documented using ADPA’s built-in documentation generators and tracked via version control.
- Engage key stakeholders early and frequently, leveraging ADPA’s collaborative output (e.g., live document generation and review sessions).
- Use automated analytics and compliance dashboards to proactively identify and address scope risks.
- Ensure all deliverables are mapped to acceptance criteria and validated through integrated testing and review workflows.

**Document Control:**  
This plan is a living document and must be reviewed and updated at each major phase or when significant scope changes are approved. All changes must be reflected in project repositories and communicated to stakeholders via established channels.
