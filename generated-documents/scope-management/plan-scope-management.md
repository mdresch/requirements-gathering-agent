# Plan Scope Management: Project Backup Vermigerous

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the scope management plan for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automating the monthly backup process and ensuring secure and reliable data recovery.  The project aims to improve the existing backup system by implementing robust automation, validation, and secure storage mechanisms.  This plan defines the project boundaries, key deliverables, and the process for managing scope changes throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Project Scope

Project Backup Vermigerous encompasses the design, development, implementation, and testing of an automated backup and recovery system.  The system will perform monthly backups of project data, categorized by year and month, ensuring sufficient backups for restoration after system failures. The scope includes:

**In Scope:**

* **Automated Backup Scheduling:** Implementing a robust automated scheduling mechanism (e.g., cron jobs, Azure Automation) for monthly backups.
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:** Implementing incremental or differential backup strategies to optimize storage and backup time.
* **Data Validation & Integrity Checks:**  Implementing automated checksum generation (SHA-256) and post-backup validation to ensure data integrity.
* **Secure Storage:** Utilizing secure, immutable storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy) with encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256 and TLS).  Multi-region replication for disaster recovery will be considered.
* **Metadata Management:**  Automating metadata tagging of backups (project name, year, month, version) and storing this metadata in a centralized index (e.g., JSON or database).
* **Automated Recovery Testing:**  Scheduling automated restore tests in a sandbox environment to verify the recoverability of backups.  Logging and alerting on test failures will be implemented.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integrating with monitoring tools (e.g., Azure Monitor) to track backup status and set up alerts for failures, delays, or storage thresholds.
* **Documentation:** Creating comprehensive documentation including this scope management plan, technical design specifications, and user manuals.


**Out of Scope:**

* Development of new applications or systems whose data needs backing up. This project focuses solely on the backup and recovery infrastructure.
*  Hardware procurement or infrastructure setup beyond the storage solution specified.
*  Integration with third-party backup solutions not specifically mentioned above.
*  Support for legacy backup systems.  The focus is on a new, improved system.


## 3. Scope Baseline

The scope baseline will be established upon approval of this document and the detailed design specifications.  The baseline will include the approved requirements, the project schedule, and the allocated budget.  Any changes to the scope baseline will be formally documented and approved through a change control process (detailed below).

## 4. Scope Verification and Control

### 4.1 Change Control Process:

All requests for changes to the project scope will be submitted using a formal change request form.  The form will include a description of the proposed change, the impact assessment (including time, cost, and resource implications), and a justification for the change.  The change request will be reviewed and approved by the Project Manager. Approved changes will be documented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.

### 4.2 Scope Verification:

Regular scope verification activities will be performed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure that the project remains on track and that the deliverables meet the defined requirements.  This will involve regular reviews of the project progress, validation of deliverables against the scope baseline, and stakeholder feedback sessions.


## 5.  Acceptance Criteria

The project will be considered complete and successfully delivered when:

* The automated backup system is fully implemented and functional.
* The automated backup system successfully completes monthly backups without errors.
* Data integrity is verified through automated checksum validation.
* Backups are securely stored in the designated storage location.
* Automated recovery tests successfully restore data from backups.
* Monitoring and alerting mechanisms are in place and functioning correctly.
* All project documentation is complete and accurate.
* Stakeholders have formally accepted the delivered system.


## 6.  Stakeholders

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project management and scope control.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for designing, developing, and testing the backup system.
* **IT Operations:** Responsible for deploying and maintaining the backup system.
* **Data Owners:** Responsible for validating the data being backed up and approving the recovery process.


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes will be formally documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
