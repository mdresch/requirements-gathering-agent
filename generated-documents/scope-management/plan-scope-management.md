# Plan Scope Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for managing the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  This plan details the processes and procedures for defining, validating, controlling, and managing changes to the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  Given the unique nature of ADPA, which itself generates project documentation and even authorized its own existence, careful scope management is paramount to ensure successful delivery and prevent uncontrolled expansion.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

ADPA's scope management will employ a hybrid approach, combining iterative development with a strong emphasis on formal documentation and change control.  The project's inherent self-documenting nature requires a robust system to manage the evolving capabilities and prevent feature creep.

**Methodology:**

* **Iterative Scope Refinement:**  The project will proceed in iterative sprints, allowing for feedback and adjustments to the scope based on testing and stakeholder input. Each iteration will have clearly defined deliverables and acceptance criteria.
* **AI-Assisted Scope Definition:** ADPA's AI capabilities will be leveraged to analyze project documentation and suggest potential scope improvements or areas for simplification.  This will be a supporting role, however, with human oversight maintaining ultimate control over scope decisions.
* **Formal Change Control:** A rigorous change control process will be implemented to manage requests for modifications to the project scope. All changes will be documented, assessed for impact, and approved by the designated authority (Project Manager).
* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Continuous engagement with stakeholders will ensure alignment on project scope and objectives. Regular feedback loops will identify and address any scope-related concerns.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:**  The scope management process will adhere to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) 7.0 standard guidelines.

**Key Principles:**

* **Clear and Concise Scope Definition:**  The project scope will be clearly articulated in the Project Scope Statement, avoiding ambiguity and ensuring common understanding among stakeholders.
* **Defined Deliverables:**  Specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) deliverables will be defined for each iteration.
* **Rigorous Acceptance Criteria:**  Clearly defined acceptance criteria will be established for each deliverable, ensuring that the scope is met before proceeding to the next iteration.
* **Proactive Risk Management:** Potential scope creep and other risks will be proactively identified and mitigated through risk management planning and execution.


## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role             | Responsibilities                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager   | Overall scope management, change request approval, stakeholder communication, risk management, adherence to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.          |
| Lead Developer    | Technical feasibility assessments, implementation of scope-related features, reporting on progress and potential scope impacts.           |
| AI Specialist     | Optimizing ADPA's AI capabilities for scope definition and analysis, providing recommendations for scope improvements, and managing AI-related risks. |
| Stakeholders      | Providing input on project requirements, validating scope, reviewing deliverables, initiating and approving change requests.              |


## 4. Scope Definition Process

**Requirements Gathering:**

1. **Analysis of Existing Documentation:** ADPA's AI capabilities will be used to analyze the existing project documentation (README, etc.) to identify core requirements.
2. **Stakeholder Interviews:** Interviews with key stakeholders (developers, PMO, business users) to gather additional requirements and clarify ambiguities.
3. **Prioritization of Requirements:**  Prioritization of requirements based on business value, feasibility, and risk.
4. **Documentation Review:**  Formal review of the gathered requirements by the project team and stakeholders.


**Scope Documentation:**

* **Project Scope Statement:** A formal document that clearly defines the project boundaries, objectives, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  This document will be reviewed and approved by key stakeholders.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into manageable work packages.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific, measurable criteria that must be met for each deliverable to be considered complete and accepted.
* **Assumptions and Constraints:**  A list of assumptions and constraints that may impact the project scope.
* **Scope Baseline:**  A formally approved version of the project scope that serves as a reference point for future scope changes.


## 5. Validation and Control

**Validation Methods:**

* **Formal Reviews:** Regular reviews of the project scope and progress against the baseline.
* **Stakeholder Sign-off:**  Formal sign-off by key stakeholders on the project scope statement and key deliverables.
* **Testing and Validation:**  Thorough testing of deliverables to ensure they meet the defined acceptance criteria.

**Change Control Procedures:**

1. **Change Request Submission:**  Stakeholders submit change requests through a formal process.
2. **Impact Assessment:**  The project team assesses the impact of the change request on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
3. **Change Request Review:**  The change request is reviewed and approved or rejected by the designated authority (Project Manager).
4. **Scope Baseline Update:**  If the change request is approved, the scope baseline is updated to reflect the changes.
5. **Communication:**  All stakeholders are informed of any scope changes.

**Configuration Management:**

A version control system (Git) will be used to track changes to the project documentation and code.  This will provide a complete audit trail of all changes made to the project scope.


## 6.  Scope Verification

The project scope will be formally verified at the completion of each iteration and at the end of the project.  This will involve a review of the deliverables against the acceptance criteria and a sign-off by the stakeholders.  The AI-generated documentation itself will be a key component of the verification process, ensuring that the final documentation accurately reflects the completed scope.


## 7.  Scope Closure

Formal closure of the project scope will occur upon successful completion and acceptance of all deliverables.  This will involve a final review of the project documentation, a sign-off by the stakeholders, and archiving of all project documentation.


This plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the ADPA project.  It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changing requirements and priorities.  The iterative nature of the project, coupled with the AI's assistance, will allow for agile adaptation while maintaining a strong emphasis on controlled scope management.
