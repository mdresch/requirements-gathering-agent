# Plan Scope Management for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the scope management plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This plan details the processes, procedures, and responsibilities for defining, validating, controlling, and managing changes to the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  The project's unique nature, focusing on AI-driven automation of business analysis tasks and delivering Fortune 500 quality deliverables, necessitates a robust scope management approach.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

This project employs a hybrid agile/waterfall approach to scope management.  Initially, a well-defined scope baseline will be established based on the documented requirements (see Appendix A).  Subsequent iterations will utilize agile principles for incremental development and refinement, ensuring continuous stakeholder alignment and feedback.

**Methodology:**

* **Requirements-driven scope definition:** The scope will be meticulously defined based on detailed functional and non-functional requirements, prioritized using a MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).
* **Iterative scope refinement process:**  Agile sprints will allow for iterative refinement of the scope based on feedback, testing, and evolving stakeholder needs.  Each sprint will have clearly defined deliverables and acceptance criteria.
* **Stakeholder-centric validation approach:**  Regular stakeholder engagement throughout the project lifecycle will ensure continuous validation of the scope and alignment with business objectives. This includes formal reviews, demos, and feedback sessions.
* **Change-controlled scope management:** A formal change control process (detailed in Section 5) will be implemented to manage any changes to the scope baseline.  All change requests will be documented, assessed for impact, and approved before implementation.

**Key Principles:**

* **Clear scope boundaries:**  A well-defined project scope statement (Appendix B) will clearly delineate the project's inclusions and exclusions, minimizing ambiguity and misunderstandings.
* **Stakeholder alignment:**  Consistent communication and feedback mechanisms will ensure that all stakeholders are informed and aligned on the project scope.
* **Documented acceptance criteria:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable to ensure that the project meets stakeholder expectations.
* **Proactive change management:**  A proactive approach to change management will minimize disruptions and ensure efficient handling of scope changes.


## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                           |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager      | Overall scope management accountability; Scope change approval authority (for significant changes); Stakeholder communication coordination; Risk management; Reporting progress. |
| Lead Developer       | Technical scope definition; Ensuring adherence to architectural and design specifications; Leading the development team; Code quality and testing.                          |
| Business Analyst     | Requirements gathering and analysis; Scope documentation (Project Scope Statement, WBS); Impact assessment support;  Facilitating stakeholder communication.                    |
| QA/Testing Team      | Verification and validation of deliverables against acceptance criteria; Reporting defects and issues; Ensuring quality and compliance.                                     |
| Stakeholders         | Requirements definition; Scope validation and acceptance; Change request initiation; Providing feedback throughout the project lifecycle.                                  |


## 4. Scope Definition Process

The scope definition process will follow these steps:

1. **Requirements Elicitation:**  Utilizing the ADPA's capabilities, requirements will be gathered from various sources including stakeholder interviews, document analysis, and existing documentation.
2. **Requirements Analysis:**  The gathered requirements will be analyzed to identify dependencies, conflicts, and ambiguities.  The MoSCoW method will be used to prioritize requirements.
3. **Scope Definition:** A detailed project scope statement (Appendix B) will be created, clearly outlining the project deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria.
4. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A comprehensive WBS will be developed to decompose the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
5. **Scope Baseline Establishment:** Once the scope statement and WBS are finalized and approved by stakeholders, they will form the project's scope baseline.


## 5. Validation and Control

**Validation Methods:**

* **Formal deliverable reviews:**  Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure that deliverables meet the defined acceptance criteria.
* **Stakeholder sign-off procedures:**  Formal sign-off procedures will be implemented to obtain stakeholder approval for key deliverables and milestones.
* **Quality gate assessments:**  Quality gates will be established at key milestones to assess the quality and completeness of the deliverables.

**Control Procedures:**

* **Change request workflow:** A formal change request workflow (Appendix C) will be used to manage any changes to the scope baseline.  This includes a process for submitting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes.
* **Impact assessment process:**  A thorough impact assessment will be conducted for each change request to evaluate its potential impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
* **Approval authority matrix:**  An approval authority matrix will define the individuals responsible for approving different types of change requests.
* **Configuration management:**  A configuration management system will be used to track and manage all project documents and deliverables.


## 6. Scope Change Management

The process for managing scope changes will adhere to the following steps:

1. **Change Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit a formal change request detailing the proposed change, rationale, and impact assessment.
2. **Change Request Review:** The Project Manager and relevant stakeholders review the change request.
3. **Impact Assessment:**  A detailed impact assessment is conducted, evaluating the potential effect on schedule, budget, and resources.
4. **Change Request Approval:** The Project Manager (or designated authority) approves or rejects the change request.
5. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change is implemented and documented.
6. **Verification and Validation:** The implemented change is verified and validated to ensure it meets requirements.

This scope management plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.  The agile nature of the project necessitates flexibility and responsiveness to changing needs, while the change management process ensures controlled and documented modifications to the scope.
