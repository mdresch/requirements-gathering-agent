# Plan Scope Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the approach for planning, defining, validating, and controlling the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  This plan ensures that all necessary work, and only the necessary work, is included to successfully deliver the project, aligning with PMBOK 7.0 standards and leveraging ADPA's unique AI-powered capabilities.  The project's self-authorization through its AI-driven strategic inception necessitates a robust scope management plan to ensure continued alignment with its evolving capabilities.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

### 2.1 Methodology:

The ADPA project utilizes an iterative and incremental scope management approach.  This involves:

* **AI-Assisted Requirements Gathering:** Leveraging ADPA's built-in AI capabilities to analyze existing documentation (README, other markdown files, etc.) and automatically generate initial scope definitions. This process includes intelligent source discovery, relevance scoring, and context building.
* **Iterative Refinement:**  The initial scope will be iteratively refined based on feedback from stakeholders, testing, and the ongoing evolution of ADPA's capabilities. This iterative process allows for adjustments based on emerging needs and technological advancements.
* **Stakeholder-Centric Validation:**  Regular stakeholder reviews and sign-offs will be conducted at key milestones to ensure alignment with evolving project goals and business needs.  This includes utilizing ADPA's capabilities to generate and distribute stakeholder communication materials.
* **Change-Controlled Management:** A formal change request process will be implemented to manage scope changes, including impact assessments, cost estimations, and stakeholder approvals.  ADPA will assist in tracking and managing change requests.
* **Version Control Integration:**  The built-in version control system within ADPA will track all changes to generated documents, providing a complete audit trail for scope management.

### 2.2 Key Principles:

* **Clear Scope Boundaries:**  The project scope will be clearly defined, with explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria.  ADPA's AI-powered analysis helps ensure clarity and consistency in scope definition.
* **Stakeholder Alignment:**  Continuous stakeholder engagement and feedback are crucial to ensure the project remains aligned with business objectives and user needs. ADPA facilitates this through automated communication and document generation.
* **Documented Acceptance Criteria:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable, ensuring that the project meets its objectives. ADPA can assist in generating and validating these criteria.
* **Proactive Change Management:**  A proactive approach to change management will be implemented to minimize disruptions and ensure timely responses to scope modifications. ADPA's version control system will support this process.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:**  All scope management activities will adhere to PMBOK 7.0 best practices. ADPA's inherent compliance features ensure adherence to these standards.


## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.1 Project Manager:

* Overall scope management accountability.
* Approval authority for scope changes.
* Coordination of stakeholder communication (leveraging ADPA for automated communication).
* Monitoring and control of scope creep.

### 3.2 Lead Developer:

* Implementation of the ADPA system and its features.
* Technical assessment of scope change requests.
* Development of any new document processors and templates as needed.

### 3.3 Business Analyst:

* Requirements gathering and analysis (leveraging ADPA's AI capabilities).
* Scope documentation and maintenance.
* Support for impact assessments on scope changes.

### 3.4 Stakeholders:

* Definition of requirements and validation of scope.
* Review and approval of deliverables.
* Initiation of change requests.


## 4. Scope Definition Process

### 4.1 Requirements Gathering:

1. **Initial AI-Driven Analysis:** ADPA will automatically analyze existing documentation (README, other markdown files) to identify initial project requirements.
2. **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Interviews with key stakeholders to validate and refine the initial requirements.
3. **Requirements Workshops:** Collaborative workshops to finalize requirements and address any ambiguities.
4. **Documentation Review:**  Review and validation of all gathered requirements.

### 4.2 Scope Documentation:

* **Project Scope Statement:** A formal document defining the project's objectives, deliverables, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.  This will be generated and updated by ADPA.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into manageable work packages.  ADPA will assist in generating and maintaining this WBS.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Clearly defined criteria for acceptance of each deliverable.  ADPA will validate these criteria against the generated documents.
* **Assumptions and Constraints:**  A documented list of assumptions and constraints that may affect the project scope.

## 5. Validation and Control

### 5.1 Validation Methods:

* **Formal Deliverable Reviews:** Regular reviews of deliverables to ensure they meet the defined acceptance criteria. ADPA will facilitate this by generating reports on document quality and compliance.
* **Stakeholder Sign-off Procedures:**  Formal sign-off procedures to obtain stakeholder approval for each deliverable.
* **Quality Gate Assessments:**  Quality gates will be established at key milestones to assess progress and identify potential scope issues. ADPA's built-in validation features will automatically assess document quality and compliance.

### 5.2 Control Procedures:

* **Change Request Workflow:** A formal process for managing change requests, including impact assessments, cost estimations, and stakeholder approvals.  ADPA will assist in tracking and managing change requests.
* **Impact Assessment Process:**  A standardized process for assessing the impact of proposed scope changes.
* **Approval Authority Matrix:**  A clearly defined matrix outlining approval authorities for different types of scope changes.
* **Configuration Management:**  A system for managing and controlling changes to the project documentation and deliverables. ADPA's version control system will provide this functionality.


## 6. Scope Baseline

The approved Project Scope Statement, WBS, and Acceptance Criteria will constitute the project scope baseline.  Any deviations from this baseline will be managed through the formal change request process.  ADPA will maintain the baseline and track all changes.


## 7.  Scope Change Control Process

1. **Change Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit a formal change request, detailing the proposed change, rationale, and impact.
2. **Impact Assessment:** The project manager, lead developer, and business analyst assess the impact of the change request on schedule, cost, and resources.
3. **Change Request Evaluation:** The project manager evaluates the change request based on its feasibility, cost-benefit analysis, and alignment with project objectives.
4. **Change Approval:** The project manager approves or rejects the change request.  Approval requires sign-off from relevant stakeholders.
5. **Implementation:** If approved, the change is implemented, and the scope baseline is updated accordingly using ADPA's version control.
6. **Verification:**  The implemented change is verified to ensure that it meets the requirements and does not negatively impact other aspects of the project.


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the evolving needs of the ADPA project.  The AI-powered nature of the project necessitates a dynamic and adaptive approach to scope management, ensuring that ADPA's capabilities are leveraged effectively throughout the project lifecycle.
