# Plan Scope Management for ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for managing the scope of the ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project.  It details the approach, roles, processes, and controls used to define, validate, and control the project's scope throughout its lifecycle.  The plan emphasizes iterative development, stakeholder collaboration, and rigorous change management to ensure the final product meets business needs and adheres to defined standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0).

## 2. Scope Management Approach

This project employs a hybrid agile/waterfall approach to scope management.  The core framework and foundational integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services) will follow a more structured, waterfall-like approach to ensure stability and compliance.  Simultaneously, the AI integration modules and advanced features will utilize an iterative, agile methodology to allow for flexibility and rapid adaptation based on user feedback and technological advancements.

**Methodology:**

* **Iterative Development:**  The project will be divided into manageable iterations, with scope defined and validated at the end of each iteration. This allows for continuous feedback and adaptation.
* **Requirements-Driven:** Scope will be defined based on documented requirements, prioritized using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), and validated against business needs.
* **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Active engagement with key stakeholders (business analysts, developers, end-users, and compliance officers) throughout the entire process to ensure alignment and buy-in.
* **Change Control:** A formal change management process will be implemented to manage and control scope changes, ensuring that all requests are evaluated for impact and approved according to predefined criteria.
* **Risk-Based Approach:**  A proactive risk management strategy will be integrated into the scope management plan to identify, assess, and mitigate potential threats to scope.  This includes identifying potential delays or resource constraints arising from AI provider limitations or changes in regulatory compliance requirements.

**Key Principles:**

* **Clear and Concise Scope Definition:** The project scope statement will be unambiguous, comprehensive, and readily understandable by all stakeholders.
* **Measurable Objectives:** Each deliverable will have clearly defined and measurable acceptance criteria.
* **Traceability:** A clear and traceable link will be maintained between requirements, design, development, and testing activities.
* **Transparency and Communication:** Regular communication and progress updates will be provided to stakeholders throughout the project.


## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role             | Responsibilities                                                                                                |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager  | Overall scope management, change control oversight, risk management, communication, reporting.               |
| Business Analyst | Requirements elicitation, analysis, documentation, scope validation, stakeholder communication.             |
| Development Team | Design, development, testing, and implementation of the ADPA framework and its components.                   |
| QA Team          | Testing and validation of deliverables against acceptance criteria and compliance requirements.                  |
| Stakeholders     | Providing requirements, validating scope, approving change requests, providing feedback throughout the process.|
| Compliance Officer | Ensuring adherence to regulatory requirements (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS). |


## 4. Scope Definition Process

The scope definition will be an iterative process, refined throughout the project lifecycle.

**Phase 1: Initial Scope Definition:**

1. **Requirements Elicitation:**  Gathering requirements through interviews, workshops, document analysis, and user stories.
2. **Scope Statement Creation:**  Developing a comprehensive project scope statement outlining project objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, assumptions, and constraints.  This will include specific details on the functionalities to be delivered in each iteration.
3. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Development:** Creating a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope into manageable work packages.  This will be refined iteratively.
4. **Baseline Establishment:** Establishing a baseline scope statement and WBS at the end of Phase 1.

**Phase 2: Iterative Scope Refinement:**

1. **Requirements Prioritization:**  Prioritizing requirements using MoSCoW method for each iteration.
2. **Iteration Planning:**  Defining the scope for each iteration based on prioritized requirements.
3. **Deliverable Definition:**  Defining specific deliverables and their acceptance criteria for each iteration.
4. **Scope Validation:**  Regular stakeholder reviews and sign-off on deliverables at the end of each iteration.


## 5. Validation and Control

**Validation Methods:**

* **Formal Reviews:** Regular reviews of deliverables with stakeholders to ensure alignment with requirements and acceptance criteria.
* **Testing:** Rigorous testing by the QA team to verify functionality, performance, and compliance.
* **Stakeholder Sign-off:** Formal sign-off by stakeholders on completed deliverables.

**Control Procedures:**

* **Change Request Management:** A formal process for submitting, evaluating, approving, and implementing scope changes.  This will include impact assessments (cost, schedule, resources, quality) for all proposed changes.
* **Configuration Management:** A system for managing and controlling the project's documentation, code, and other assets.
* **Issue Tracking:** A system for tracking and resolving issues that may impact the project scope.


## 6. Scope Baseline and Change Control Process

The initial scope statement and WBS will serve as the project baseline.  Any changes to the baseline will be managed through a formal change control process:

1. **Change Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit a formal change request documenting the proposed change, justification, and impact assessment.
2. **Change Request Evaluation:** The project manager and relevant stakeholders evaluate the change request, assessing its impact on cost, schedule, resources, and quality.
3. **Change Request Approval:** The change request is approved or rejected by the appropriate authority (e.g., project steering committee).
4. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change is implemented and documented.
5. **Change Verification:** The implemented change is verified to ensure it meets the requirements and has not introduced any negative impacts.


## 7.  Metrics and Reporting

The following metrics will be tracked and reported regularly:

* **Scope Change Requests:** Number and type of change requests submitted and approved/rejected.
* **Scope Creep:**  Any deviations from the baseline scope.
* **Compliance:**  Adherence to defined standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
* **Schedule Variance:**  Differences between planned and actual schedules.
* **Cost Variance:** Differences between planned and actual costs.


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in requirements, risks, and priorities.
