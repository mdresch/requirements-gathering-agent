# Plan Scope Management for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the scope management plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This plan details the approach to defining, validating, controlling, and managing changes to the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  The project's unique focus on generating high-quality, compliant business analysis documentation using AI necessitates a robust scope management approach to ensure deliverables align with stakeholder expectations and industry standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK).

## 2. Scope Management Approach

This project employs a hybrid agile/waterfall approach to scope management.  The core functionality (API development and BABOK v3 framework generation) will follow a waterfall approach with clearly defined phases and deliverables.  However, future expansion and integration with additional frameworks (e.g., PMBOK, DMBOK) will be managed iteratively using agile principles.

**Methodology:**

* **Requirements-driven scope definition:** Scope will be defined based on detailed requirements elicited from stakeholders (documented in `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`).
* **Iterative scope refinement:**  While the core functionality has a fixed scope, subsequent iterations will refine and extend the capabilities based on user feedback and market needs.  This iterative approach is documented in the project roadmap (`Project Roadmap.md` - assumed document).
* **Stakeholder-centric validation:** Regular stakeholder engagement will ensure ongoing alignment between the project deliverables and their expectations.  This includes formal reviews and acceptance criteria (defined in `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD` and related documents).
* **Change-controlled scope management:** A formal change request process will be implemented to manage and control any deviations from the approved scope. This process is detailed in Appendix A.

**Key Principles:**

* **Clear scope boundaries:** The project scope is clearly defined, differentiating between included and excluded features (explicitly stated in `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`).
* **Stakeholder alignment:** Continuous communication and collaboration with stakeholders ensure consensus on scope and priorities.
* **Documented acceptance criteria:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria are defined for each deliverable (detailed in `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` and related documents).
* **Proactive change management:**  A formal change control process is in place to manage and mitigate the impact of scope changes.


## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager      | Overall scope management, change request approval, risk management, communication, resource allocation, reporting.                                                                         |
| Lead Developer       | Technical oversight, ensuring adherence to architecture and coding standards, managing development tasks, code reviews.                                                                |
| Business Analyst     | Eliciting and documenting requirements, creating and maintaining scope documentation, validating deliverables against acceptance criteria, stakeholder communication.                        |
| QA/Testing Team      | Defining test plans and cases, executing testing, reporting defects, ensuring quality and compliance with acceptance criteria.                                                              |
| Stakeholders         | Defining requirements, validating scope, approving deliverables, initiating and reviewing change requests.                                                                                |


## 4. Scope Definition Process

The scope definition process involves several iterative steps:

1. **Requirements Elicitation:** Gathering detailed requirements using various techniques (interviews, workshops, document analysis, as described in `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`).  The AI capabilities are leveraged to assist in this process.
2. **Scope Documentation:** Creating comprehensive documentation including a project scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and detailed acceptance criteria. This documentation leverages the generated output from the ADPA API itself, ensuring consistency and compliance.
3. **Scope Review and Validation:**  Formal reviews with stakeholders to validate the documented scope and ensure alignment with their expectations.
4. **Scope Baseline Establishment:**  Once the scope is validated and approved, it is established as the project baseline.


## 5. Validation and Control

**Validation Methods:**

* **Formal deliverable reviews:** Regular reviews of deliverables against acceptance criteria, involving stakeholders and the QA/Testing team.
* **Stakeholder sign-off:** Formal sign-off from stakeholders on key deliverables to confirm acceptance and agreement.
* **Quality gate assessments:**  Assessment of deliverables at predefined milestones to ensure quality and compliance.

**Control Procedures:**

* **Change request workflow:** A formalized process for submitting, evaluating, approving, and implementing scope changes (detailed in Appendix A).
* **Impact assessment:**  Assessment of the impact of proposed changes on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
* **Configuration management:**  Tracking and managing all project documents and artifacts.


## 6. Scope Baseline and Change Management

The approved scope documentation (project scope statement, WBS, acceptance criteria) forms the project baseline. Any changes to this baseline must follow the formal change request process outlined in Appendix A.


## Appendix A: Change Request Process

1. **Change Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit a formal change request form documenting the proposed change, rationale, and impact assessment.
2. **Change Request Evaluation:** The Project Manager evaluates the change request, considering its impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources.  The Business Analyst assesses its impact on the requirements and deliverables.
3. **Change Request Approval/Rejection:** The Project Manager approves or rejects the change request based on the evaluation.  Major changes require stakeholder approval.
4. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change is implemented, and the project documentation is updated accordingly.
5. **Change Verification:** The implemented change is verified to ensure it meets the requirements and does not negatively impact other aspects of the project.


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to this plan will be documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
