# Plan Scope Management for Requirements Gathering Agent (Project README)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for managing the scope of the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project (hereinafter referred to as "RGA").  The RGA aims to revolutionize project documentation generation by leveraging AI to produce PMBOK-compliant deliverables.  This plan ensures that the project delivers the intended functionality while adhering to defined constraints and managing potential scope creep.  The unique aspects of this project, including its reliance on multiple AI providers and the need for robust error handling, are specifically addressed.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

### 2.1 Methodology:

We will employ an iterative and incremental approach to scope management, incorporating Agile principles. This includes:

* **Iterative Refinement:**  Scope will be defined initially at a high level and progressively elaborated through iterative cycles of requirements gathering, analysis, and validation.  Each iteration will produce a refined scope statement and updated deliverables.
* **Agile-Based Development:**  Using Agile methodologies, we will break down the project into manageable sprints, allowing for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements within defined constraints.
* **Risk-Based Approach:**  Potential risks to scope, such as AI provider limitations or unexpected technical challenges, will be proactively identified and mitigated.

### 2.2 Key Principles:

* **Clear and Concise Scope Statement:**  A well-defined scope statement will serve as the baseline for all project activities.
* **Stakeholder Collaboration:**  Active engagement with stakeholders (Development Team, Product Owner, Architecture Team, Testing Team) throughout the process is crucial for ensuring alignment and managing expectations.
* **Documented Acceptance Criteria:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable to ensure quality and facilitate objective validation.
* **Proactive Change Management:**  A formal change request process will be implemented to manage any scope changes efficiently and transparently.  This includes impact assessments and approval procedures.


## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role             | Responsibility                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager   | Overall scope management, change control, stakeholder communication, risk management                             |
| Lead Developer    | Technical scope definition, implementation, testing, and integration of AI providers                             |
| Business Analyst  | Requirements elicitation, analysis, documentation, and validation of acceptance criteria                       |
| Stakeholders      | Providing requirements, validating scope, approving changes, providing feedback throughout the development process |


## 4. Scope Definition Process

### 4.1 Requirements Gathering:

The requirements gathering process will leverage the existing documentation (02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD, PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD, etc.) and will include:

* **Review Existing Documents:** Thorough analysis of the provided project documentation to consolidate and clarify functional and non-functional requirements.
* **Clarification Meetings:**  Meetings with stakeholders to address ambiguities and gain consensus on requirements.
* **Prioritization:**  Prioritizing requirements based on business value, risk, and feasibility.

### 4.2 Scope Documentation:

The following documents will be created and maintained:

* **Project Scope Statement:** A formal document clearly defining the project's objectives, deliverables, boundaries, and exclusions.  This will explicitly address the exclusion of security features as noted in PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Specific and measurable criteria that must be met for each deliverable to be considered complete and accepted.
* **Assumptions and Constraints:**  A list of assumptions made during scope definition and any constraints that may impact the project.  This includes limitations on AI provider APIs and any dependencies.


## 5. Validation and Control

### 5.1 Validation Methods:

* **Sprint Reviews:** Regular reviews at the end of each sprint to assess progress against the scope and identify any deviations.
* **Formal Acceptance Testing:**  Testing against the defined acceptance criteria before final release.
* **Stakeholder Sign-off:**  Formal sign-off from key stakeholders on completed deliverables.

### 5.2 Control Procedures:

* **Change Request Process:**  A formal process for proposing, evaluating, and approving or rejecting changes to the project scope.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):**  A group of stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving change requests.
* **Configuration Management:**  A system for managing and tracking changes to the project documentation and deliverables.
* **Regular Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of progress against the scope baseline to identify potential issues early.

## 6.  Scope Exclusions

Explicitly excluded from this project's scope, as defined in PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD, are:

* Security Classifications
* Audit Trail Logging
* Compliance Headers
* Regulatory Metadata
* Enterprise Security Features


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes to the project scope.  The iterative nature of the project allows for flexibility, but adherence to the change control process is paramount to maintain project control and prevent scope creep.
