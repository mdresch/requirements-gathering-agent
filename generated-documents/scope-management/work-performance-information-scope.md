## 5. Performance Analysis

### Scope and Deliverable Variance

- **BABOK/PMBOK Modules**: Delivered on schedule and accepted by QA and pilot clients.
- **DMBOK 2.0 Module**: Minor delay due to evolving industry requirements and resource allocation to Adobe integration.
- **Adobe Creative Suite Phase 2**: On track; SDK and authentication work packages completed, API integration in progress.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Initial architecture complete; implementation on track for Q3.
- **Integration Testing**: Slightly behind original schedule (SPI 0.98) due to third-party API response delays.

### Risks & Issues

- **Integration Complexity**: Managing multiple enterprise integrations (Adobe, SharePoint, Confluence) requires ongoing coordination and robust error handling.
- **Evolving Compliance Standards**: Adaptation to new regulatory requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA) may require further scope adjustment.
- **Resource Allocation**: Balancing feature development and technical debt management remains a challenge.

### Quality and Acceptance

- All delivered modules have passed regression and performance testing.
- User feedback for completed deliverables is highly positive; minor usability enhancements are being tracked in the backlog.
- No critical defects outstanding in production-ready components.
