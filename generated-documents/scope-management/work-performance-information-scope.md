# Work Performance Information (Scope): Project Backup Vermigerous

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the scope and performance of Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on the automated monthly backup and validation of project data for reliable system recovery.  The project aims to improve data backup processes through automation, enhanced security, and efficient recovery procedures.  This document details the project's scope, key performance indicators (KPIs), and progress against planned deliverables.

## 2. Project Scope

Project Backup Vermigerous encompasses the design, implementation, and ongoing maintenance of a fully automated monthly backup system.  The system's primary function is to create and validate backups of project data, ensuring data integrity and rapid recovery in case of system failure.  The backups are categorized by year and month for easy retrieval and management.

**In Scope:**

* **Automated Backup Scheduling:** Implementation of a robust automated scheduling mechanism (e.g., cron jobs, Azure Automation) to trigger monthly backups.
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:**  Implementation of incremental or differential backup strategies to optimize storage space and backup time.
* **Data Validation & Integrity Checks:** Automated generation and verification of checksums (e.g., SHA-256) to ensure data integrity after each backup.
* **Secure Storage Architecture:**  Storage of backups in a secure, immutable location (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy) with encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256 and TLS).  Multi-region replication for disaster recovery will be considered.
* **Metadata Tagging & Categorization:** Automatic tagging of backups with relevant metadata (project name, year, month, version) for efficient retrieval.  Centralized metadata storage (e.g., JSON or database) will be implemented.
* **Automated Recovery Testing:**  Regular automated testing of the backup restoration process in a sandbox environment to validate recoverability.  Comprehensive logging and alerting for any failures.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Integration with a monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor) to track backup status and generate alerts for failures, delays, or storage threshold breaches.

**Out of Scope:**

* Development of new project applications or data sources.  The project focuses solely on the backup and recovery processes of existing systems.
* Manual intervention for backup operations (except for initial setup and configuration).
* Support for legacy backup systems or data formats that are not currently in use.


## 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Backup Success Rate:** Percentage of successful backups completed without errors. Target: 100%.
* **Backup Time:** Average time taken to complete a full backup. Target: < X minutes (to be determined based on data volume).
* **Restore Time:** Average time taken to restore a complete backup. Target: < Y minutes (to be determined based on data volume).
* **Storage Utilization:**  Amount of storage space used for backups.  Regular monitoring and optimization to prevent exceeding allocated limits.
* **Alert Response Time:** Time taken to resolve alerts related to backup failures. Target: < Z minutes (to be determined based on severity).


## 4. Deliverables

* **Automated Backup Script/Job:**  Fully functional automated backup script or job configured for monthly execution.
* **Secure Storage Infrastructure:**  Configured secure storage location with encryption and access control.
* **Data Validation Mechanism:** Implemented checksum generation and verification process.
* **Recovery Test Script:** Automated script for regular testing of backup restoration.
* **Monitoring Dashboard:** Integrated monitoring system with alerts configured for critical events.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Detailed documentation covering setup, configuration, troubleshooting, and maintenance.


## 5. Project Schedule (High-Level)

*(A detailed Gantt chart will be provided in a separate document.)*

* **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):** Design, planning, and initial setup of infrastructure.
* **Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):** Development and testing of automated backup script/job.
* **Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):** Implementation of secure storage, data validation, and monitoring.
* **Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16):**  Automated recovery testing, final testing, and deployment.


## 6. Risks and Mitigation Strategies

*(A detailed risk register will be provided in a separate document.)*

* **Risk:** Failure of automated backup process. **Mitigation:** Robust error handling, logging, and alerting mechanisms; regular testing.
* **Risk:** Security breach of backup storage. **Mitigation:** Strong encryption, access control, and regular security audits.
* **Risk:** Insufficient storage capacity. **Mitigation:**  Regular monitoring of storage utilization, proactive capacity planning, and automated alerts.


## 7. Assumptions and Constraints

* The existing project data is readily accessible and appropriately formatted for backup.
* Necessary infrastructure (servers, network, storage) is available and functional.
* Relevant permissions and access rights are granted for all required systems and services.
