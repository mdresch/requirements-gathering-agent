# Project Scope Statement: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, version 2.2.0.  The RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  This includes, but is not limited to, project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.  A key objective is to enhance efficiency and consistency in project initiation and planning.  The project specifically targets internal use within the organization to streamline project management processes.  Compliance with relevant legislation for international use is a high-level requirement, although specific security features are explicitly out of scope for this version (see Section 3).


**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

* **Automate Documentation:**  Generate comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project documentation automatically from provided input data.
* **Improve Efficiency:** Reduce the time and effort required for manual document creation.
* **Enhance Consistency:** Ensure consistent application of PMBOK standards across all projects.
* **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Integrate with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) to offer flexibility and redundancy.
* **Provide User-Friendly Interface:** Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for easy user interaction and configuration.
* **Ensure Data Integrity:** Implement robust schema validation to guarantee the accuracy and compliance of generated documents.


**3. Project Scope**

**3.1 Included:**

* Development of a CLI-driven application.
* Integration with specified AI providers (@azure-rest/ai-inference, @azure/identity, @azure/openai, @google/generative-ai, @microsoft/microsoft-graph-client, openai).
* Generation of PMBOK-compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure).
* JSON-formatted output for interoperability.
* Schema validation of generated outputs.
* Basic user documentation and tutorials.
* Modular architecture to facilitate future expansion.


**3.2 Excluded:**

* Integration with third-party project management tools (This is planned for future versions).
* Advanced security features such as audit trails, comprehensive security classifications, and regulatory metadata compliance headers (These are explicitly deferred to future releases).
* SharePoint and Confluence integrations (While the codebase contains scripts for these, they are not within the scope of this release and require separate configuration and testing).
* Extensive user training beyond basic documentation.
* Support for languages other than English (This is a future enhancement).


**4. Deliverables**

* Fully functional Requirements Gathering Agent application (version 2.2.0).
* Comprehensive user documentation (CLI usage, output formats, troubleshooting).
* Source code repository with version control.
* Unit and integration tests demonstrating functionality.


**5. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete and successfully delivered when:

* All functional requirements (as detailed in the Requirements Management Plan, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`) are met.
* The application generates accurate and PMBOK-compliant documents.
* The CLI interface is user-friendly and intuitive.
* Unit and integration tests pass successfully.
* User documentation is comprehensive and clear.


**6. Project Constraints**

* The project timeline is subject to the availability of the development team.
* Budget is constrained to the allocated resources.
* The project scope may be adjusted based on unforeseen technical challenges, however, major deviations will require separate approval.


**7. Assumptions**

* The specified AI providers will remain accessible and functional throughout the project.
* Necessary infrastructure (servers, network connectivity) will be available.
* The development team possesses the necessary skills and expertise.


**8. Approvals**
