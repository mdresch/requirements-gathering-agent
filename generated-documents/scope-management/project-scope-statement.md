## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Project Goal:** To develop a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.  This framework will provide CLI and REST API interfaces for generating professional documentation adhering to BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 standards.

**Project Justification:**  ADPA addresses the need for efficient, accurate, and standards-compliant document generation across various business functions, improving productivity and reducing manual effort.  The API-first architecture ensures scalability and integration with existing enterprise systems.

## 2. Project Deliverables

**2.1 Core Deliverables:**

* **Production-Ready REST API:** A fully functional REST API adhering to TypeSpec specifications, enabling programmatic access to ADPA's document generation capabilities.  This includes comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 documentation and Swagger UI for easy exploration.  Acceptance criteria:  Successful generation of all defined document types via API calls, achieving 99.9% uptime during load testing with 1000 concurrent users, and passing all security penetration tests.
* **Modular CLI:** A command-line interface providing user-friendly access to ADPA's core functionalities, including document generation, framework integration, and configuration management. Acceptance criteria: Successful execution of all defined commands with expected outputs and comprehensive user documentation.
* **Admin Web Interface (Next.js):** A user-friendly web interface for managing ADPA configurations, monitoring system health, and accessing advanced features. Acceptance criteria:  Complete UI functionality, responsive design across multiple browsers and devices, and successful integration with backend API.
* **AI Engine:** A robust AI processing engine capable of integrating with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) with automatic failover. Acceptance criteria:  Successful integration with all specified AI providers, demonstrating seamless failover between providers, and achieving an average response time under 2 seconds for document generation.
* **Integration Modules:** Pre-built integration modules for Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services. Acceptance criteria:  Successful authentication and data transfer for each integration, with comprehensive unit and integration tests.  All integrations must meet defined security standards.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Complete documentation covering all aspects of ADPA, including installation, usage, API specifications, and troubleshooting.  This includes a user manual, API reference, and developer guide. Acceptance criteria:  Completion of all documentation sections, with technical accuracy validated by peer review and user testing.

**2.2 Secondary Deliverables:**

* **Automated Testing Suite:**  Comprehensive unit and integration tests covering all core components. Acceptance criteria: 95% code coverage and successful execution of all tests.
* **Deployment Scripts:**  Scripts for deploying ADPA to various environments (e.g., cloud, on-premise). Acceptance criteria:  Successful deployment to target environments, with monitoring and logging capabilities.

## 7. Scope Management Plan

Changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change request process.  All change requests will be evaluated based on their impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources.  Approved changes will be documented and incorporated into the project plan.  Regular scope reviews will be conducted with stakeholders to ensure alignment and address any potential scope creep.  This document will serve as the baseline for scope management, and any deviations will be formally documented and approved.
