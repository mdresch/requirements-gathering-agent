# Project Scope Statement: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Project Goal:** To deliver a production-ready API (ADPA) that leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks and related documentation in seconds, significantly reducing manual effort and improving the quality and consistency of deliverables for enterprise-level projects.  The system will be validated against Fortune 500-level data and use cases.

**2. Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a robust and scalable Express.js API with comprehensive error handling, security features (authentication, rate limiting, input validation), and real-time job management.
*   Implement a TypeSpec-driven architecture to ensure API-first design principles and maintainability.
*   Integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) to allow flexible and adaptable AI-powered document generation.
*   Generate BABOK v3-compliant documents, including but not limited to: stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.  Future expansion to include PMBOK and DMBOK frameworks is planned.
*   Enable the generation of documents in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
*   Provide a user-friendly CLI for easy interaction and configuration.
*   Develop comprehensive documentation, including API specifications (OpenAPI 3.0), user guides, and developer documentation.
*   Validate the system's functionality and performance using real-world Fortune 500-grade data and use cases.
*   Achieve a 90% reduction in time spent on requirements gathering compared to traditional methods.


**3. Project Deliverables:**

*   Production-ready Express.js API (deployed to [Specify Deployment Environment, e.g., Azure])
*   Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 API specification
*   CLI application for user interaction
*   User documentation (including quick start guides and tutorials)
*   Developer documentation (including API reference and architecture diagrams)
*   Validated BABOK v3 compliant framework generation examples
*   Test data and results demonstrating Fortune 500 validation
*   Automated deployment scripts

**4. Project Scope (Included):**

*   Development and testing of the core API functionality.
*   Integration with specified AI providers.
*   Generation of BABOK v3 compliant documents.
*   Implementation of enterprise-grade security features.
*   Development of a user-friendly CLI.
*   Creation of comprehensive documentation.
*   Validation testing using Fortune 500-level datasets.

**5. Project Scope (Excluded):**

*   Integration with third-party project management tools (future enhancement).
*   Development of custom AI models (future enhancement).
*   Support for languages other than English (future enhancement).
*   On-going maintenance and support beyond initial release (separate contract).
*   Training and consulting services to end users (separate contract).


**6. Assumptions:**

*   Access to necessary AI provider APIs and appropriate API keys.
*   Availability of reliable infrastructure for API deployment and testing.
*   Availability of suitable test data representing Fortune 500 scenarios.


**7. Constraints:**

*   Project timeline: [Specify Project Timeline]
*   Budget: [Specify Budget]
*   Resource availability: [Specify Resource Availability]


**8. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful completion of all unit and integration tests.
*   Successful generation of BABOK v3 compliant documents according to defined templates and inputs.
*   Demonstrated 90% reduction in requirements gathering time against pre-defined benchmarks.
*   Successful completion of Fortune 500 validation scenarios.
*   Positive review and acceptance of all documentation.
*   Successful deployment to the designated environment.


**9. Project Sign-off:**
