# Project Scope Statement

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Goal:** To develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project documentation from a project's existing documentation and metadata.  The tool will leverage advanced AI capabilities for contextual understanding and hierarchical authority recognition, aiming to produce executive-quality deliverables autonomously.

**3. Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool capable of generating a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents.
*   Implement a comprehensive technical design document generation system, including at least ten specialized document types (e.g., architecture design, system design, database schema, API documentation, security design).
*   Integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) offering a flexible and robust solution.
*   Implement an enhanced context manager capable of utilizing up to 90% of available tokens for large language models, dramatically improving the accuracy and completeness of generated documents.
*   Develop a system for intelligent project analysis that automatically discovers and prioritizes relevant project documentation beyond the README file.  This includes smart relevance scoring (0-100) based on content, location, naming patterns, structure, and depth.
*   Develop a built-in version control system (VCS) for generated documents to track changes and enable version history management.
*   Implement a robust validation framework ensuring PMBOK 7.0 compliance and providing quality scores and recommendations for generated documents.
*   Develop a system for generating strategic business communication documents (e.g., company values, purpose statements) from project context.
*   Achieve a minimum of 175 weekly downloads on NPM within the first three months of release.


**4. Project Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional CLI application (requirements-gathering-agent)
*   Comprehensive documentation (including this Project Scope Statement, user guides, and API documentation).
*   A suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents (e.g., Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Stakeholder Register, etc.).
*   A suite of technical design documents (at least ten specialized types).
*   Strategic business communication documents (e.g., company values, purpose statement).
*   Automated testing and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.


**5. Project Boundaries (Inclusions):**

*   Development of the core application functionality (document generation, AI integration, context management, validation).
*   Creation of professional-quality templates for all generated document types.
*   Implementation of a user-friendly CLI.
*   Development of comprehensive documentation.
*   Integration with at least four AI providers.
*   Implementation of a version control system for generated documents.
*   Automated testing and CI/CD.

**6. Project Boundaries (Exclusions):**

*   Integration with external project management tools (this is planned for future phases).
*   Support for non-markdown input formats (e.g., .docx, .pdf).
*   Advanced features such as collaborative editing or real-time document updates.
*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Support for complex regulatory compliance frameworks beyond PMBOK 7.0.


**7.  Assumptions:**

*   Sufficient access to relevant AI provider APIs will be maintained throughout the project.
*   The project team will have access to necessary resources (hardware, software, expertise).
*   Stakeholder feedback will be provided promptly and consistently.
*   The provided project documentation will be accurate and up-to-date.


**8. Constraints:**

*   Project timeline (defined separately in the project schedule).
*   Budget limitations (defined separately in the project budget).
*   Availability of specific AI models and API limits.


**9. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful generation of all specified document types with PMBOK 7.0 compliance.
*   Successful integration with all specified AI providers.
*   Positive user feedback based on usability testing.
*   Achievement of defined performance metrics (e.g., document generation speed, context utilization).
*   Successful completion of all planned testing phases.
*   Attainment of the 175 weekly NPM downloads objective.


**10.  Stakeholders:**

*   Development Team
*   Product Owner
*   Business Analysts
*   Project Managers
*   End-users


This Project Scope Statement serves as a baseline for the project and will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to the scope will be formally documented and approved by relevant stakeholders.
