# Project Scope Statement

**1. Project Title:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**2. Project Manager:** Menno Drescher

**3. Date:** June 16, 2025

**4. Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from a project's existing documentation, including README files and other relevant project artifacts.  The tool will also generate strategic business documents such as purpose statements and company values.

**5. Project Objectives:**

*   Automate the creation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.
*   Enhance the quality of project documentation by leveraging AI-powered analysis and generation.
*   Improve stakeholder alignment by providing clear, concise, and readily accessible documentation.
*   Increase project efficiency by streamlining the documentation process.
*   Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards and best practices.
*   Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for easy access and usage.
*   Support multiple AI providers for flexibility and redundancy.
*   Implement a robust context management system to optimize the use of large language models.
*   Implement a built-in version control system for generated documents.


**6. Project Deliverables:**

*   A fully functional command-line tool (requirements-gathering-agent) deployable via npm.
*   Comprehensive documentation including a user manual, API reference, and troubleshooting guide.
*   A suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents (e.g., Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc.).
*   A set of strategic business documents (e.g., Purpose Statement, Company Values).
*   Automated testing and validation procedures.
*   A built-in version control system within the generated documents folder.


**7. Project Scope (Inclusions):**

*   Development of a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction.
*   Integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama AI providers.
*   Intelligent analysis of project documentation beyond the README file, including requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, and other relevant files.
*   Generation of a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents.
*   Generation of strategic business documents derived from project context.
*   Implementation of a robust error handling and retry mechanism.
*   Implementation of a 3-phase context management strategy for optimal LLM utilization.
*   PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and quality assessment features.
*   A built-in version control system for all generated documents.
*   Comprehensive user documentation and support materials.

**8. Project Scope (Exclusions):**

*   Integration with third-party project management software (future enhancement).
*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) (future enhancement).
*   Support for non-markdown documentation formats (future enhancement).
*   Customizable document templates beyond the PMBOK standard templates (future enhancement).
*   Hosting and deployment of the tool (user responsibility).


**9. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful generation of all specified PMBOK and strategic documents with minimal errors.
*   Positive user feedback and successful completion of user acceptance testing.
*   Achieving a PMBOK 7.0 compliance score of at least 90% for all generated documents.
*   Successful integration with all supported AI providers.
*   Tool stability and robustness demonstrated through rigorous testing.

**10. Assumptions:**

*   Availability of necessary API keys and access credentials for chosen AI providers.
*   Sufficient project documentation to enable comprehensive AI-driven analysis.
*   Access to a suitable development environment meeting the specified requirements.

**11. Constraints:**

*   Project timeline and budget limitations.
*   Availability of specific AI model capabilities.
*   Potential limitations of AI technology.

**12. Stakeholders:**

*   Project Manager
*   Development Team
*   Business Analysts
*   Project Sponsors
*   End-users


This Project Scope Statement serves as a formal agreement between the project team and stakeholders, outlining the boundaries and objectives of the ADPA project.  Any changes to the scope will require a formal change request and approval process.
