# Project Scope Statement: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of Project Backup Vermigerous, an initiative to automate and enhance the backup process for critical project data, ensuring reliable and secure recovery in the event of system failure.  The project focuses on improving efficiency, security, and recoverability of monthly backups.

**2. Project Goals**

* Automate the monthly backup process.
* Implement robust validation and integrity checks for backups.
* Securely store backups using a resilient and encrypted architecture.
* Implement a system for efficient metadata tagging and categorization of backups.
* Establish automated recovery testing procedures.
* Implement monitoring and alerting to ensure backup process health.

**3. Project Deliverables**

* **Automated Backup Script:** A fully automated script (e.g., PowerShell, Azure Automation) scheduled to execute monthly backups. This script will handle incremental/differential backups to optimize storage and time.
* **Backup Validation Script:** A script to generate and verify checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for each backup, ensuring data integrity.
* **Secure Storage Implementation:** Configuration and implementation of secure backup storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy and encryption at rest and in transit).  This will include multi-region replication for disaster recovery.
* **Metadata Management System:** A system (e.g., JSON files, database) to store and manage backup metadata, including project name, year, month, and version.
* **Automated Recovery Test Script:** A script that performs regular automated restore tests in a sandbox environment, logging results and sending alerts for failures.
* **Monitoring and Alerting System:** Integration with a monitoring platform (e.g., Azure Monitor, Log Analytics) to track backup status and trigger alerts for failures or delays.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:** Documentation detailing the backup process, scripts, storage architecture, and monitoring procedures.


**4. Project Scope (Inclusions)**

* Development and implementation of all scripts and systems listed above.
* Testing and validation of the entire backup and recovery process.
* Documentation of the entire solution.
* Configuration of secure storage within the specified cloud environment (Assuming Azure based on context).

**5. Project Scope (Exclusions)**

* Development of the applications being backed up.  This project only focuses on the backup and recovery process itself.
* Implementation of new applications or systems.  This project enhances existing systems.
* Hardware procurement or infrastructure setup outside of the specified cloud environment.
* User training beyond the provided documentation.
* Ongoing maintenance and support after project completion (unless explicitly contracted).
* Integration with third-party backup solutions not specified in the design choices.


**6. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete when:

* All deliverables are successfully implemented and documented.
* The automated backup process completes successfully without errors for three consecutive months.
* Automated recovery tests successfully restore data from backups for three consecutive months.
* The monitoring and alerting system is fully functional and configured to send alerts as defined.
* All documentation is reviewed and approved by stakeholders.


**7. Project Assumptions**

* Necessary cloud resources and permissions are available.
* Access to the systems and data to be backed up is granted.
* Stakeholders will provide timely feedback and approvals.


**8. Project Constraints**

* Project timeline and budget are defined separately.
* Potential dependencies on external systems or services may impact timelines.


**9. Project Approvals**
