# Project Scope Statement

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that automates the generation of comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documentation, including strategic business communications and detailed technical design documents, based on project context extracted from various sources beyond just the README.

**3. Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a modular, extensible architecture supporting multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Implement a comprehensive context manager capable of extracting and prioritizing relevant information from diverse project documentation sources (README, requirements documents, architecture specifications, stakeholder information, etc.).
*   Generate a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents, including but not limited to: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Communication Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule, etc.
*   Generate detailed technical design documents including Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, and Error Handling.
*   Generate strategic business communication documents, such as Purpose Statements and Company Values.
*   Implement a built-in version control system for all generated documents.
*   Develop a user-friendly CLI with options for individual document generation, batch processing, PMBOK validation, and quality assessment reporting.
*   Achieve 90% context utilization for large language models (LLMs) such as Gemini 1.5 Pro.
*   Maintain a high level of accuracy and consistency across all generated documents, validated against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation, including a user guide and API reference.


**4. Project Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional CLI application (requirements-gathering-agent).
*   Comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documentation templates.
*   Detailed technical design document templates.
*   Strategic business communication document templates.
*   User guide and API reference documentation.
*   Source code repository with version control.


**5. Project Boundaries:**

*   **In Scope:**  Development of the CLI tool, including all features listed in the objectives. Generation of all specified document types using AI. Implementation of a version control system for generated documents.  Comprehensive testing and quality assurance.
*   **Out of Scope:** Integration with third-party project management software (future consideration). Support for non-markdown project documentation formats (future consideration).  Development of custom AI models.  Providing hosting or deployment services for the tool.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The CLI tool successfully generates all specified document types with high accuracy and consistency.
*   Generated documents adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards and best practices.
*   The tool integrates seamlessly with specified AI providers.
*   The context manager effectively extracts and prioritizes relevant information from diverse documentation sources.
*   The version control system functions as expected.
*   The user guide and API reference are comprehensive and user-friendly.
*   The tool passes all defined unit and integration tests.
*   The tool achieves a minimum of 90% context utilization for large language models where applicable.


**7. Assumptions:**

*   The necessary AI provider APIs will remain available and stable throughout the project lifecycle.
*   Sufficient project documentation will be available to provide adequate context for AI-driven document generation.
*   Relevant AI models will provide sufficiently accurate and consistent output.


**8. Constraints:**

*   Project timeline and budget are defined (refer to project charter).
*   Adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards is mandatory.
*   The tool must be compatible with Node.js 18.0.0 or higher.


**9. Stakeholders:**

*   Project Manager
*   Development Team
*   Business Analysts
*   End-users (Project Managers, Business Analysts)


**10.  Project Success Measurement:**

*   Successful completion of all deliverables within budget and timeline.
*   Positive user feedback and adoption of the tool.
*   High accuracy and consistency of generated documents validated against PMBOK standards.
*   High level of context utilization by the AI model.

This Project Scope Statement serves as a guiding document and will be subject to change management procedures as defined in the Project Management Plan.
