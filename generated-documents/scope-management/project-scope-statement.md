# Project Scope Statement

**1. Project Title:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**2. Project Goal:** To develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documentation and technical design documents, utilizing advanced context management and multiple AI providers.  The tool will also translate technical project context into strategic business communications.

**3. Project Objectives:**

*   **Automated Document Generation:**  Automatically generate a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documents (e.g., Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Register, Stakeholder Register, etc.) and a comprehensive set of technical design documents (e.g., Architecture Design, System Design, API Documentation, etc.) based on project context derived from various sources (README.md, other Markdown files, project metadata).
*   **Enhanced Context Management:** Implement a sophisticated three-phase context management system that optimizes context utilization for various large language models (LLMs), resulting in significantly improved document accuracy and completeness.  This system will prioritize relevant project information based on relevance scoring and integrate information from multiple sources beyond the project's README.md file.
*   **Multi-Provider Support:** Integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to offer flexibility and resilience.  The tool should seamlessly switch between providers based on availability and performance, with intelligent failover mechanisms.
*   **Validation and Quality Assurance:**  Implement robust validation mechanisms to ensure PMBOK 7.0 compliance and provide detailed quality scores and recommendations for generated documents.  This includes cross-document consistency checks.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide a clear, intuitive, and user-friendly CLI interface with detailed help documentation and examples.
*   **Version Control:** Integrate a version control system (VCS) for generated documents, enabling tracking of changes and facilitating collaboration.
*   **Strategic Business Communication Translation:** Develop the capability to translate complex technical project information into concise, impactful strategic business communications (e.g., purpose statements, company values).
*   **Modular Architecture:**  Design a modular architecture to facilitate future expansion and integration with other project management tools and platforms (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint).

**4. Project Deliverables:**

*   A fully functional CLI tool (requirements-gathering-agent) deployed to npm.
*   Comprehensive documentation including user guides, API documentation, and architecture documentation.
*   A set of PMBOK 7.0 compliant document templates.
*   A suite of technical design document templates.
*   A robust testing framework with unit and integration tests.
*   A fully functional version control system integrated into the tool.

**5. Project Scope (Inclusions):**

*   Development of the core CLI tool with all features listed in the objectives.
*   Integration with at least three AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and one other).
*   Generation of all specified document types (PMBOK and technical design documents).
*   Implementation of the three-phase context management system.
*   PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation.
*   Version control system for generated documents.
*   Comprehensive documentation.

**6. Project Scope (Exclusions):**

*   Integration with third-party project management tools beyond the scope of testing and future development plans.
*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Support for non-markdown-based project documentation sources (e.g., .docx, .pdf).  (Future Consideration)
*   Real-time collaboration features. (Future Consideration)
*   Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards. (Future Consideration)


**7. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful generation of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents with a quality score above 90%.
*   Successful generation of technical design documents meeting defined templates and quality standards.
*   Successful integration with at least three AI providers, demonstrating effective failover mechanisms.
*   User acceptance testing demonstrating ease of use and intuitive navigation of the CLI.
*   Successful execution of version control functionality.
*   Positive user feedback from beta testing.


**8. Project Constraints:**

*   Project timeline (defined separately).
*   Budget (defined separately).
*   Availability of AI provider APIs and associated costs.
*   Technological limitations of LLMs and the capacity for context handling.


**9. Assumptions:**

*   Necessary AI provider API keys and access credentials will be available.
*   The project team has the required technical expertise.
*   Stakeholder involvement will be consistent and timely.
*   The project will adhere to defined development methodologies.


**10. Stakeholders:**

*   Development Team
*   Project Manager
*   Business Analysts
*   End-Users (Project Managers, Business Analysts)


This Project Scope Statement serves as a guiding document to ensure the project stays focused and delivers the intended value.  Any changes to the scope will require a formal change request process.
