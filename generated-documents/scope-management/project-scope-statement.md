# Project Scope Statement: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis using AI and a BABOK v3 compliant framework.  This project aims to deliver a production-ready API capable of generating high-quality, Fortune 500-grade business analysis deliverables in seconds, significantly reducing time and effort compared to traditional methods.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

* Develop a production-ready, scalable, and secure Express.js API adhering to API-first design principles (TypeSpec).
* Implement a robust document generation engine capable of producing BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, integrating regulatory compliance (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* Provide a user-friendly interface (CLI) for easy interaction and configuration.
* Validate the system's capabilities through real-world scenarios mirroring Fortune 500 company requirements.
* Deliver comprehensive documentation, including API specifications, user guides, and examples.


**3. Project Deliverables**

The following deliverables will be produced as part of this project:

* **Production-Ready API:** A fully functional and tested Express.js API deployed to a production environment (localhost for initial development, subject to change).
* **API Documentation:** Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specifications and interactive API documentation (Swagger UI).
* **CLI Tool:** A command-line interface for easy API interaction and configuration management.
* **Enterprise Templates:** Pre-built templates for generating BABOK v3 compliant documents.
* **Sample Deliverables:** Example outputs demonstrating the capabilities of the API using real-world data (Fortune 500 GlobalBank data provided).
* **User Documentation:** Comprehensive guides and tutorials for API usage and system administration.
* **Test Data and Scenarios:**  A suite of test data and scenarios, including the Fortune 500 GlobalBank case study.


**4. Project Scope – INCLUSIONS**

This project explicitly includes:

* Development and testing of the core API functionality.
* Implementation of authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation mechanisms.
* Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc. - subject to feasibility and resource allocation).
* Generation of BABOK v3 compliant documents in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* Comprehensive error handling and logging.
* Development and maintenance of the CLI tool.
* Creation of comprehensive documentation.


**5. Project Scope – EXCLUSIONS**

The following are explicitly excluded from the scope of this project:

* Integration with third-party project management tools (potential future enhancement).
* Development of a full-fledged user interface beyond the CLI.
* Support for additional business analysis methodologies beyond BABOK v3 (potential future enhancement).
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial release (separate support agreement will be required).
* Deployment to a cloud environment other than a locally hosted environment (initial phase).


**6. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete when:

* The API passes all defined unit and integration tests.
* The API successfully generates BABOK v3 compliant documents according to the defined templates.
* The CLI tool is fully functional and user-friendly.
* All deliverables are completed and meet the specified quality standards.
* The Fortune 500 GlobalBank case study demonstrates successful framework generation.


**7. Assumptions and Constraints**

* The project assumes access to necessary AI APIs and relevant licenses.
* The project is constrained by the availability of resources (personnel, budget, time).
* The project assumes the availability of the Fortune 500 GlobalBank test data.


**8. Project Timeline**

(A detailed project timeline should be included here, specifying key milestones and deadlines.)


**9. Approvals**

(Space for signatures and dates of approval from relevant stakeholders.)
