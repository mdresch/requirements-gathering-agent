# Project Scope Statement

**Project Name:**  
ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Version:**  
3.2.0

**Prepared by:**  
ADPA Project Team

**Date:**  
July 2025

---

## 1. Project Purpose and Justification

**Purpose:**  
The ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) project aims to deliver a modular, secure, and scalable automation framework for enterprise requirements, project, and data management. By leveraging AI-powered document generation, standards compliance, and seamless integration with leading enterprise platforms, ADPA addresses the need for efficient, accurate, and standards-aligned documentation in modern organizations.

**Justification:**  
Current enterprise environments struggle with manual, inconsistent, and non-compliant documentation processes. ADPA automates and standardizes documentation workflows by embedding best practices from BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0, increasing productivity, reducing risks, and ensuring regulatory compliance for Fortune 500 and similarly scaled organizations.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

- **Automate** the generation of professional, standards-compliant business and technical documentation.
- **Integrate** AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama, Azure OpenAI) for intelligent document processing and generation.
- **Support** cross-framework business analysis and project management standards (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).
- **Provide** both CLI and REST API interfaces for flexible enterprise adoption.
- **Enable** direct publishing and management in Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, and version control systems.
- **Ensure** robust security, regulatory compliance (Basel III, GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.), and scalability.

---

## 3. Scope Description

### **Inclusions**

  - Unified document templates and reporting for cross-framework analysis.
- **AI-Driven Automation**
  - Multi-provider AI integration with automatic failover.
  - Smart context management and intelligent prompt injection.
- **User Interfaces**
  - CLI tools for power users and automation.
  - REST API server with OpenAPI/TypeSpec specifications for integration.
  - Next.js-based admin web interface for management and analytics.
- **Enterprise Integrations**
  - Confluence and SharePoint integration for publishing and document management.
  - Adobe PDF/Document Services integration for high-fidelity output.
  - Version control integration (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps).
- **Compliance & Security**
  - Enterprise-grade authentication/authorization (OAuth2, Active Directory, SAML).
  - Regulatory compliance features for financial, security, and industry standards.
- **Scalability & Operations**
  - Microservices-ready architecture for horizontal scaling.
  - Caching (Redis), load balancing, and health monitoring.
- **Testing & Quality**
  - Automated unit, integration, and performance tests.
  - TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier, and conventional commits.

### **Exclusions**
- Direct support for proprietary or legacy document formats not covered by the frameworks.
- Custom AI model development (beyond integration with listed providers).
- Implementation of frameworks outside BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK scope (subject to roadmap).
- Mobile application delivery (planned for future phases).

---

## 4. Deliverables

- **Production-ready ADPA CLI and REST API packages**
- **Admin web interface for document and user management**
- **Comprehensive, standards-compliant document templates**
- **Integration modules for Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, and VCS platforms**
- **Automated test suites and coverage reports**
- **Deployment scripts for cloud and on-premise environments**
- **User and developer documentation (GitHub Wiki, inline help, API docs)**
- **Compliance documentation and configuration samples**

---

## 5. Project Boundaries

- **Start:** Project begins with requirements analysis and architecture design.
- **End:** Project concludes with the release of a production-ready, enterprise-scale automation framework, delivery of documentation, and initial deployment guidance.
- **Phase 2 & Beyond:** Advanced Adobe Creative Suite presentation layer, Docker/Kubernetes support, advanced analytics, SSO, and real-time collaboration are included in the roadmap but are not part of the current release‚Äôs core scope.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- Solution generates valid, standards-compliant documents using BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and (where implemented) DMBOK 2.0 templates.
- All integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe PDF, VCS) function as documented in enterprise scenarios.
- REST API passes comprehensive functional and security tests (API key/JWT authentication, rate limiting, OpenAPI compliance).
- CLI and web interfaces are operational and support all user stories in the documentation.
- Security and compliance features meet outlined regulatory requirements.
- Test coverage meets or exceeds 90% for critical paths.
- Documentation is complete, up-to-date, and accessible.

---

## 7. Constraints

- Node.js >=18.0.0 and TypeScript >=5.7 are required.
- Integration with third-party AI providers and cloud platforms is subject to their availability, licensing, and API limits.
- Current DMBOK 2.0 support is in progress; full support will be delivered in upcoming releases.
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment templates are scheduled for future phases.

---

## 8. Assumptions

- Enterprise clients will have access to necessary API credentials for AI and integration providers.
- Users can provision required infrastructure (cloud/on-premise) and satisfy security prerequisites.
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback and access to relevant documentation standards as needed.
