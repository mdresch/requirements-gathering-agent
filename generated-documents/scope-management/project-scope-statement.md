# Project Scope Statement: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of the Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV) project.  The project aims to develop a new class of electric vehicles that significantly reduce reliance on traditional charging infrastructure by harvesting ambient energy. This will address range anxiety, charging infrastructure gaps, grid strain, and the cost and inconvenience associated with current EV charging methods.

**2. Project Goals**

* Develop a functional prototype of a self-charging electric vehicle capable of harvesting solar, kinetic, and thermal energy.
* Demonstrate a significant increase in effective vehicle range compared to a standard EV without self-charging capabilities.
* Develop an AI-powered energy management unit (EMU) to optimize energy harvesting and distribution.
* Validate the feasibility and efficiency of the integrated energy harvesting technologies through rigorous testing and simulation.

**3. Project Deliverables**

* **M1: Component Feasibility & Simulation Report:** A comprehensive report detailing the research, benchmarking, and simulation results for the selected solar, kinetic, and thermoelectric technologies.  This will include a digital twin model and projected energy generation under various conditions.
* **M2: Prototype Hardware:** Functional prototypes of the three core hardware systems:  photovoltaic body panel (hood section), regenerative shock absorber, and thermoelectric generator (TEG) unit for a battery pack.  These will be accompanied by detailed test results and specifications.
* **M3: Test Mule Integration and Data Report:** An existing EV (“test mule”) retrofitted with the prototype hardware.  A report summarizing the real-world performance data collected from this integration, including energy generation under various driving conditions.
* **M4: Energy Management Unit (EMU) v1.0:** A functional prototype of the EMU software and hardware capable of reading data from all integrated sensors and logging this data for analysis. This version will not include advanced control logic, which is planned for a future phase.
* **Final Project Report:** A comprehensive report summarizing all project activities, findings, and conclusions. This report will include a detailed cost-benefit analysis and recommendations for future development.

**4. Project Exclusions**

This project will *not* include:

* Full-scale production of the SCEV.  This phase focuses on proof-of-concept and prototype development.
* Development of the complete EMU control logic and optimization algorithms.  This will be addressed in subsequent project phases.
* Design and manufacturing of a fully integrated vehicle body. The focus is on demonstrating the functionality of the core energy harvesting components.
* Extensive crash testing and regulatory compliance certifications.  These are outside the scope of this initial prototype development.
* Marketing and sales activities.


**5. Project Assumptions**

* Access to suitable existing EV platforms for the test mule.
* Availability of necessary research and development resources (materials, equipment, software).
* Successful integration of the chosen technologies with minimal unforeseen technical challenges.
* Collaboration and information sharing between project teams and external partners (if any).


**6. Project Constraints**

* **Timeline:** The project will be completed within [Insert timeframe].
* **Budget:** The project budget is capped at [Insert budget].
* **Technical Complexity:**  The integration of multiple energy harvesting technologies presents significant technical challenges.


**7. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered successful upon the completion of all deliverables outlined in section 3, and the successful demonstration of the core functionality of the SCEV prototype, specifically the ability to harvest and utilize energy from solar, kinetic, and thermal sources.  The acceptance criteria for each deliverable will be defined in more detail in subsequent project documentation.


**8. Scope Management**

Changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change request process.  All change requests will be documented, evaluated for impact on cost, schedule, and resources, and approved by the project sponsor before implementation.


This Project Scope Statement serves as a guiding document for the SCEV project and will be regularly reviewed and updated as needed.
