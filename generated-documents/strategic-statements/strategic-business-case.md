# Strategic Business Case: Project ICT Governance Framework (Project ID: 68cf79515c797b952fbb7bec)

**Date:** October 26, 2023


## Executive Summary

This document presents a strategic business case for "Project: ICT Governance Framework,"  aimed at establishing a robust governance structure for the organization's modern, multi-cloud, multi-tenant hybrid VMware and local infrastructure environment.  The project addresses the increasing complexities of managing IT infrastructure in a self-service employee software environment.  The key value proposition is improved operational efficiency, reduced risk, enhanced security, and increased agility, ultimately driving cost savings and enabling faster innovation.  Expected strategic outcomes include improved IT service delivery, enhanced compliance, and a strengthened competitive position.


## Strategic Alignment

This initiative directly aligns with the organization's strategic goals of:

* **Digital Transformation:**  Modernizing IT infrastructure and enabling a self-service model are critical components of our digital transformation strategy.
* **Cost Optimization:** Improved efficiency and reduced risk will lead to significant cost savings in the long term.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  A comprehensive governance framework minimizes security vulnerabilities and compliance risks.
* **Enhanced Agility:**  Streamlined processes and improved infrastructure management will enable faster response to business needs.

The project's focus on a multi-cloud, multi-tenant hybrid environment reflects the organization's commitment to leveraging the benefits of cloud technologies while maintaining control and security.  This positions us competitively by enabling faster innovation and greater flexibility than competitors relying on legacy infrastructure.
