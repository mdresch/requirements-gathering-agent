# Data Model Suggestions for ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework)

---

## 1. Entity Relationship Analysis

### 1.1 Core Business Entities

Based on the requirements, the following primary entities are identified:

- **User**: End users including admins, analysts, project managers, stakeholders, etc.
- **Team**: Groups of users collaborating on projects.
- **Project**: High-level workspaces for managing document generation, templates, and workflows.
- **Document**: Generated outputs (PDF, Markdown, etc.) and associated metadata.
- **Template**: Document templates compliant with BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK, etc.
- **Framework**: Supported standards (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7, DMBOK 2.0).
- **AI Provider**: Registered AI backends (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
- **Integration**: External system connections (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, etc.).
- **Job**: Asynchronous document generation or conversion operations.
- **Role**: Permission grouping for RBAC.
- **Permission**: Granular access rights.
- **Audit Log**: Security and compliance event tracking.

### 1.2 Entity Relationships & Cardinality

- **User ↔ Team**: Many-to-many (users can belong to multiple teams; teams have multiple users).
- **Team ↔ Project**: One-to-many (a team owns many projects; a project belongs to one team).
- **User ↔ Project**: Many-to-many (for sharing or access control beyond teams).
- **Project ↔ Document**: One-to-many (project contains documents).
- **Document ↔ Template**: Many-to-one (each document is generated from a template).
- **Template ↔ Framework**: Many-to-one (templates are linked to a standard).
- **Project ↔ Integration**: Many-to-many (projects may have multiple integrations).
- **User ↔ Role**: Many-to-many (users can have multiple roles).
- **Role ↔ Permission**: Many-to-many (RBAC).
- **Document ↔ Job**: One-to-many (a document may have multiple jobs for generation/updates).
- **AI Provider ↔ Job**: One-to-many (track which AI provider handled which job).
- **User ↔ Audit Log**: One-to-many (user triggers logs).

## 2. Data Model Recommendations

### 2.1 Logical Data Model Structure

- Use a **relational model** for core business entities (users, teams, projects, documents, templates, frameworks, RBAC).
- Store large document/template content as external objects (object storage or BLOB columns), reference via URLs/file paths.
- Store AI provider and integration configurations as JSON/BLOB columns for flexibility.
- Use **junction tables** for:
  - user_team (user_id, team_id, role_id, joined_at)
  - user_role (user_id, role_id)
  - role_permission (role_id, permission_id)
  - project_integration (project_id, integration_id)
  - user_project (user_id, project_id, role_id)

### 2.2 Physical Implementation Considerations

- Prefer **UUIDs** for primary keys for distributed scalability and security.
- For high concurrency (collaboration, real-time editing), consider optimistic locking/versioning on Document.
- For audit and compliance, dedicate a write-optimized log table (partitioned by date).
- Use **PostgreSQL** or **Azure SQL** for core data; consider **NoSQL** (Cosmos DB, MongoDB) for audit logs or versioned document content if needed.

### 2.3 Normalization Recommendations

- Normalize up to 3NF for core operational tables (avoid redundant data, simplify updates).
- Denormalize for read-heavy analytics/reporting tables as appropriate (materialized views for dashboards).
- Store large/unstructured template content as external BLOB (S3, Azure Blob) and reference via URL if size becomes an issue.

### 2.4 Index Strategy Suggestions

- Unique indexes on all natural keys: username, email, team name, project name (scoped to team), template name (scoped to framework).
- Composite indexes for frequent queries:
  - (project_id, status) on Document
  - (team_id, status) on Project
  - (user_id, team_id) on user_team
  - (role_id, permission_id) on role_permission
  - (document_id, status) on Job
- GIN/JSONB indexes for querying into config_json or variables columns.

## 3. Database Design Guidelines

### 3.1 Table Structure Recommendations

- Use **singular, lower_snake_case** table names: user, team, project, document, template, framework, ai_provider, integration, job, role, permission, audit_log.
- Use **junction tables** for all many-to-many relationships, include audit fields (created_at, updated_at).
- For versioned documents/templates, add: version (integer), previous_version_id (FK).

### 3.2 Data Type Selections

- UUIDs for all PKs and FKs.
- VarChar(255) for names, emails, and slugs.
- Text/BLOB for large content (documents, templates).
- JSONB for config and variable fields.
- Enum types for status fields (where supported).
- Timestamps (with timezone) for all created_at, updated_at, etc.

### 3.3 Constraint Definitions

- **NOT NULL** on all required fields.
- **UNIQUE** on all natural keys (username, email, etc.).
- **FOREIGN KEY** constraints with ON DELETE CASCADE/SET NULL as appropriate.
- **CHECK** constraints for enums (status, type).
- **Default values** for status, created_at, updated_at.

### 3.4 Performance Optimization Strategies

- Partition large tables (audit_log, job) by date or project for fast querying and archival.
- Use read replicas for analytics/reporting workloads.
- Implement connection pooling.
- Periodically archive or purge historical document/job/audit data.
- Use caching (Redis) for frequently accessed metadata (frameworks, templates).
- Consider database-level encryption for sensitive columns (PII, API keys).

---

## 4. Data Governance Framework

### 4.1 Data Quality Standards

- Enforce schema validation at the API and DB layer.
- Require all core fields (names, emails, document/template metadata) to be populated.
- Use referential integrity for all FKs.
- Automate duplicate detection for templates, projects, documents.

### 4.2 Data Validation Rules

- Validate email format, password strength, and unique usernames on user creation.
- Enforce allowed file formats during document upload/generation.
- Check that referenced templates/frameworks exist before document generation.
- Validate JSON config fields using JSON schema validation libraries (AJV, Joi).

### 4.3 Data Security Considerations

- Use salted hash (bcrypt) for password storage.
- Store API tokens/credentials encrypted at rest.
- Apply RBAC at the database and application layers.
- Log all access to sensitive data in the audit log.
- Implement row-level security (PostgreSQL RLS) for multitenancy if needed.
- Use database encryption (TDE) for persistent storage.
- Mask PII in logs and exports.

### 4.4 Backup & Recovery Strategies

- Daily full backups, hourly incrementals for core DB.
- Store backups in geographically redundant storage (Azure, AWS).
- Point-in-time recovery enabled for production environments.
- Regular test restores to validate backup integrity.
- Retention policy: 30 days standard, 7 years for audit/compliance logs.
- Store versioned documents/templates for rollback.

## Closing Notes

- This model provides a scalable, extensible foundation for ADPA’s document processing, automation, and enterprise integration needs.
- It aligns with industry best practices for security, compliance, and maintainability.
- The design supports both immediate project requirements and long-term enterprise growth (multi-tenancy, high concurrency, auditability, and integration extensibility).

---

**Next Steps:**  
- Review entity relationships with business/product owners.
- Prioritize implementation of core tables and RBAC.
- Prototype schema using PostgreSQL or Azure SQL.
- Validate with integration and API use cases.
- Establish data validation and governance processes early.
