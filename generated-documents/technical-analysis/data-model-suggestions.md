## Data Model Suggestions for Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines data model suggestions for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and industry best practices.  The provided project documentation highlights a focus on generating PMBOK-compliant documents and integrating with multiple AI providers.  Security and compliance are explicitly mentioned as *not* in scope in some documents, while other documents suggest a need for international compliance in a banking context. This creates a tension that must be addressed.  We will create a model that can be easily extended to include security and compliance features later if needed.

**1. Entity Relationship Analysis**

The core entities revolve around managing projects, documents, templates, and AI provider interactions.  We will initially omit security and compliance-related entities, as their inclusion is explicitly excluded in some requirements.  However, the model will be designed to accommodate their addition later.


| Entity             | Attributes                                                                  | Primary Key     | Foreign Key(s)          | Cardinality                               |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Project**         | ProjectID (UUID), ProjectName, Description, CreatedDate, UpdatedDate, Status | ProjectID       |                             | 1:N (with Documents, Users)               |
| **User**             | UserID (UUID), Username, Email, PasswordHash (hashed), Role               | UserID          |                             | 1:N (with Projects, Documents)           |
| **Document**        | DocumentID (UUID), ProjectID, DocumentName, DocumentType, CreatedDate, UpdatedDate, Content (JSON), Status, AIProviderUsed | DocumentID      | ProjectID, UserID           | N:1 (with Project), N:1 (with User)        |
| **Template**        | TemplateID (UUID), TemplateName, Description, TemplateType, Content (JSON)   | TemplateID       |                             | 1:N (with Documents)                      |
| **AIProvider**      | ProviderID (UUID), ProviderName, APIKey, EndpointURL                      | ProviderID       |                             | 1:N (with Documents)                      |
| **DocumentJob**      | JobID (UUID), DocumentID, Status, StartedAt, CompletedAt, ErrorMessage | JobID           | DocumentID                 | 1:1 (with Document)                       |
| **Log**             | LogID (UUID), Timestamp, Level, Message, Context (JSON)                   | LogID           |                             |                                           |


**Cardinality:**  1:1 (one-to-one), 1:N (one-to-many), N:1 (many-to-one), N:M (many-to-many)


**2. Data Model Recommendations**

* **Logical Data Model Structure:**  Relational model, utilizing the entities and relationships defined above.
* **Physical Implementation Considerations:** PostgreSQL or MySQL are suitable choices due to their robust features, scalability, and JSON support.  Consider cloud-based solutions like AWS RDS or Azure Database for PostgreSQL for easier management and scalability.
* **Normalization Recommendations:**  Aim for at least 3NF (Third Normal Form) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
* **Index Strategy Suggestions:** Create indexes on primary keys, foreign keys, and frequently queried attributes (e.g., `ProjectID`, `DocumentType`, `CreatedDate`, `ProviderName`).


**3. Database Design Guidelines**

* **Table Structure Recommendations:** Each entity will be represented as a table with the corresponding attributes.  Foreign keys will enforce referential integrity.
* **Data Type Selections:** Use appropriate data types (UUID, VARCHAR, TEXT, TIMESTAMP, JSONB) based on the attribute characteristics.  JSONB is preferred for storing JSON data for efficient querying.
* **Constraint Definitions:**  Enforce primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, NOT NULL constraints where necessary, and unique constraints where appropriate (e.g., on `Username`, `Email`).
* **Performance Optimization Strategies:**  Use appropriate indexing strategies, query optimization techniques (e.g., using EXPLAIN PLAN), and database connection pooling.


**4. Data Governance Framework**

* **Data Quality Standards:** Define standards for data accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.  Implement data validation rules to enforce these standards.
* **Data Validation Rules:**  Implement checks for data types, ranges, formats, and business rules during data entry and updates.
* **Data Security Considerations:**  While explicitly excluded in some requirements, the design should allow for easy integration of security features later. This might include:
    * Access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive data.
    * Data encryption at rest and in transit.
    * Auditing mechanisms to track data access and modifications.
* **Backup and Recovery Strategies:** Implement regular database backups and a robust recovery plan to minimize data loss in case of failures.  Consider using point-in-time recovery.

**Addressing the Tension: Security and Compliance**

The apparent conflict between requirements (some explicitly excluding security, others implying a need for international banking compliance) necessitates a flexible design. The core model above is designed to be extensible.  Future phases could easily incorporate:

* **Compliance Entity:** A `ComplianceRequirement` entity could track regulatory requirements, their mapping to specific documents or data fields, and audit logs for compliance checks.
* **Security Entity:** A `SecurityClassification` entity could be added to classify data sensitivity, along with user roles and permissions tied to that classification.
* **Audit Log Enhancement:** The existing `Log` entity could be enhanced to include user IDs, actions performed, and data changes.

This phased approach allows for initial development focused on core functionality, with security and compliance added iteratively as requirements evolve and become more concrete.  Regular review of regulatory requirements and security best practices will be crucial throughout the project lifecycle.
