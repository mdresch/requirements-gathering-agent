# Data Model Architecture Recommendations for Requirements Gathering Agent

## Overview:
The Requirements Gathering Agent project involves generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI models, enhanced context management, and intelligent source discovery. The data model must support:
- **Document generation workflows**
- **AI context management**
- **Configuration of AI providers**
- **Project metadata and relationships**
- **Traceability between requirements, stakeholders, and artifacts**

Given the projectâ€™s requirements, the data model should prioritize **flexibility**, **performance**, **traceability**, and **security**, while being scalable for large projects with multiple files, stakeholders, and AI configurations.

---

## Recommended Database Technology:
### **Hybrid Approach**:
- **Relational Database (SQL)** for structured data like project metadata, document templates, and relationships.
- **NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB)** for unstructured data like markdown content, enriched context, and AI-generated outputs.

### Justification:
- **Relational DB** ensures strong consistency and integrity for core entities and their relationships.
- **NoSQL DB** efficiently handles hierarchical and semi-structured data, such as markdown files and AI model configurations.

## Key Attributes and Data Types:
- **UUIDs** for primary and foreign keys to ensure uniqueness and scalability.
- `ENUM` types for standardized values (e.g., document types, validation statuses, provider names).
- `JSONB` for enriched context and markdown content in NoSQL storage.
- Timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) for auditability and version control.

---

## Indexing Recommendations:
- **Primary Indexes**:
  - `project_id` for **Project**.
  - `document_id` for **Document**.
  - `stakeholder_id` for **Stakeholder**.
  - `config_id` for **AI_Configuration**.
- **Secondary Indexes**:
  - `type` on **Document** for querying specific document types.
  - `relevance_score` on **File_Discovery** for efficient scoring-based lookups.

---

## Data Integrity Constraints:
- **Foreign Key Constraints**:
  - Ensure relationships between entities are maintained.
- **Validation Rules**:
  - Enforce required fields like `project_id`, `type`, `provider_name`.
- **Unique Constraints**:
  - Prevent duplicate entries of `filename` within a project.

---

## Normalization Level Recommendations:
- **Third Normal Form (3NF)** for relational entities to minimize redundancy and ensure data integrity.
- **Denormalization** for **Context** and **File_Discovery** in NoSQL storage to optimize performance for hierarchical and unstructured data.

---

## Scalability and Performance Considerations:
- **Partitioning**: Use partitioned tables for large datasets (e.g., by project or document type).
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data like enriched context.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Enable NoSQL databases to scale horizontally for large markdown and context datasets.
