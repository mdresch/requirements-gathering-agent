## Data Model Suggestions: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines data model suggestions for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, focusing on scalability, maintainability, and adherence to industry best practices.  The model addresses both the API's operational data and the generated business analysis documents.  Due to the lack of explicit details on the structure of the generated documents in the provided README, assumptions will be made regarding their key attributes.  Adjustments will be needed based on the final document structure.


**1. Entity Relationship Analysis**

The core entities revolve around users, API requests, jobs, documents, templates, and AI providers.

* **User:**
    * `user_id` (INT, Primary Key)
    * `username` (VARCHAR(255), Unique)
    * `email` (VARCHAR(255), Unique)
    * `api_key` (VARCHAR(255), Unique)
    * `role` (ENUM('admin', 'user'), Default 'user')
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)

* **APIRequest:**
    * `request_id` (INT, Primary Key)
    * `user_id` (INT, Foreign Key referencing User)
    * `request_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `method` (VARCHAR(10))
    * `endpoint` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `request_body` (JSON)
    * `response_code` (INT)
    * `response_body` (JSON)
    * `ip_address` (VARCHAR(45))

* **Job:**
    * `job_id` (INT, Primary Key)
    * `user_id` (INT, Foreign Key referencing User)
    * `request_id` (INT, Foreign Key referencing APIRequest)
    * `template_id` (INT, Foreign Key referencing Template)
    * `status` (ENUM('queued', 'processing', 'completed', 'failed'), Default 'queued')
    * `start_time` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `end_time` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `progress` (INT, Default 0)
    * `error_message` (TEXT)


* **Document:**
    * `document_id` (INT, Primary Key)
    * `job_id` (INT, Foreign Key referencing Job)
    * `filename` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `file_path` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `file_type` (VARCHAR(50))
    * `file_size` (BIGINT)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `content` (MEDIUMTEXT)  *(Consider alternative storage like object storage for large files)*
    * `metadata` (JSON)  *(To store PMBOK/BABOK specific data)*

* **Template:**
    * `template_id` (INT, Primary Key)
    * `name` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `description` (TEXT)
    * `category` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `tags` (JSON)
    * `template_content` (MEDIUMTEXT) *(Consider storing as a separate file and linking the path here)*


* **AIProvider:**
    * `provider_id` (INT, Primary Key)
    * `name` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `api_key` (VARCHAR(255))  *(Sensitive data; consider secure storage)*
    * `status` (ENUM('active', 'inactive'))
    * `config` (JSON)


**Cardinality:**

* User 1:N APIRequest
* User 1:N Job
* APIRequest 1:1 Job
* Job 1:N Document
* Job 1:1 Template


**2. Data Model Recommendations**

* **Logical Data Model:**  The ERD above depicts the logical model.  Relationships are clearly defined.

* **Physical Implementation:**  A relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or similar) is recommended.  Consider using a cloud-based database service for scalability and ease of management.

* **Normalization:**  The model aims for 3NF (Third Normal Form) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.

* **Index Strategy:**  Indexes should be created on foreign keys, frequently queried columns (`status` in Job, `file_type` in Document), and unique constraints (e.g., `username`, `email`, `api_key`).


**3. Database Design Guidelines**

* **Table Structure:**  Each entity maps to a separate table.  Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity.

* **Data Type Selections:** Data types are chosen based on the expected data, optimizing for storage and performance.

* **Constraint Definitions:**  Primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and data type constraints are defined to ensure data validity.

* **Performance Optimization:**  Proper indexing, query optimization, and database tuning are crucial for performance, especially with large datasets.  Consider database connection pooling.


**4. Data Governance Framework**

* **Data Quality Standards:**  Data validation rules should be implemented at the API level (using libraries like Zod) and potentially within stored procedures to maintain data consistency.

* **Data Validation Rules:**  Input validation at the API layer is essential.  Database-level constraints enforce further validation.

* **Data Security Considerations:**  API keys should be securely stored and managed.  Access control mechanisms should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user data).  Encryption at rest and in transit should be considered.

* **Backup and Recovery Strategies:**  Regular database backups and a robust recovery plan are crucial for disaster recovery.  Consider point-in-time recovery options.  Utilize cloud-provided backup solutions.


**Further Considerations:**

* **Scalability:** The database should be designed to handle a growing number of users, requests, and documents.  Consider sharding or other scaling techniques if needed.

* **Document Storage:** For large documents, consider using cloud storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) instead of storing the entire content directly in the database.  The `content` column in the `Document` table would then store a reference (e.g., a URL) to the file in the cloud storage.

* **API Logging:**  Comprehensive API logging (including request/response details) is essential for debugging, monitoring, and security auditing.

* **Error Handling:** The database schema should accommodate error messages and status codes to track job failures and provide informative feedback to users.

This comprehensive data model provides a strong foundation for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  Remember to adapt and refine the model based on further project requirements and the specific structure of the generated documents.  The focus should remain on building a robust, scalable, and secure system.
