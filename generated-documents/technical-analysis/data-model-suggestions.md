## Data Model for Requirements Gathering Agent

The Requirements Gathering Agent processes a significant amount of diverse data, requiring a robust and scalable data model.  A hybrid approach, combining relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases, is recommended to optimize for different data characteristics.

**I. Relational Database (SQL) –  For structured data:**

This database will store metadata about projects, users, generated documents, and structured results from the PMBOK validation.  We'll use a PostgreSQL database for its robustness, scalability, and features.

**A. Entities and Relationships:**

* **Projects:**
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `project_name` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Users)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `repository_url` (VARCHAR(255))  // GitHub or other repo URL
    * `ai_provider` (VARCHAR(50)) // e.g., "AzureOpenAI", "GoogleAI", "GitHubAI"
    * `ai_model` (VARCHAR(50)) // e.g., "gpt-4", "gemini-pro"


* **Users:**
    * `user_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)
    * `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)


* **Documents:**
    * `document_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `document_type` (VARCHAR(255)) // e.g., "Project Charter", "Risk Management Plan"
    * `filename` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `generated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `content` (TEXT) // Store the generated document content
    * `quality_score` (FLOAT) // Score from 0-100
    * `pmbok_compliance_score` (FLOAT) // Score from 0-100


* **Validation_Results:**
    * `validation_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `document_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Documents)
    * `validation_type` (VARCHAR(255)) // e.g., "PMBOK 7.0 Compliance", "Consistency Check"
    * `result` (JSONB) // Store structured validation results
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)


* **File_Analysis_Results:**
    * `analysis_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `filepath` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `relevance_score` (FLOAT) // Score from 0-100
    * `category` (VARCHAR(50)) // e.g., "Planning", "Development", "Documentation"
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)


**B.  Relationships:**

* One-to-many relationship between Users and Projects.
* One-to-many relationship between Projects and Documents.
* One-to-many relationship between Documents and Validation_Results.
* One-to-many relationship between Projects and File_Analysis_Results.


**C. Indexing:**

* Index `project_id` in Documents and Validation_Results tables.
* Index `user_id` in the Projects table.
* Index `document_type` in the Documents table for efficient filtering.
* Index `filepath` in File_Analysis_Results for quick file lookup.


**D. Constraints:**

* Enforce `NOT NULL` constraints on relevant columns.
* Ensure uniqueness of usernames and emails in the Users table.
* Check constraints for valid score ranges (0-100).


**E. Normalization:**

The model is designed to be in at least 3NF (Third Normal Form).


**II. NoSQL Database (MongoDB) – For unstructured and semi-structured data:**

This database will store the unstructured project context extracted from markdown files and other sources.  MongoDB's flexibility handles the varying structures and sizes of this data effectively.


**A. Collections:**

* **Project_Context:**
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `context_data` (JSON) // Store the extracted text, potentially large
    * `source_files` (ARRAY of strings) // List of file paths contributing to the context


**B. Indexing:**

* Index `project_id` for efficient retrieval of project context.


**III. Database Technology Recommendations:**

* **Relational:** PostgreSQL – Offers robust features, scalability, and JSONB support for handling structured validation data.
* **NoSQL:** MongoDB – Handles the variable structure and size of the project context effectively.


**IV. Scalability and Performance Considerations:**

* **Sharding:** For very large projects and user bases, consider sharding both the relational and NoSQL databases.
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load, especially for frequently accessed data like project metadata and validation results.
* **Query Optimization:** Optimize SQL queries and MongoDB aggregations for efficient data retrieval.
* **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple database instances.


**V. Data Security and Privacy:**

* **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
* **Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms to restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.
* **Data Masking:** Consider data masking techniques to protect sensitive information.
* **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).


**VI. Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD - Textual Representation):**

```
Projects *---1 Users
Projects 1---* Documents
Documents 1---* Validation_Results
Projects 1---* File_Analysis_Results

Projects --- Project_Context (NoSQL)
```


This hybrid data model provides a robust and scalable solution for the Requirements Gathering Agent, effectively managing both structured and unstructured data while addressing performance, security, and maintainability concerns.  The specific implementation details (e.g., table sizes, data types) should be refined based on further requirements analysis and performance testing.
