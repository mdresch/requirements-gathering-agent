## Data Model Suggestions: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines data model suggestions for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  The model focuses on scalability, maintainability, and performance, adhering to industry best practices.

**1. Entity Relationship Analysis**

The core business entities revolve around projects, documents, AI providers, and users (though user details might be handled externally for this MVP).  The relationships are described below.

| Entity             | Attributes                                                                  | Primary Key     | Foreign Key(s)   |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Project             | ProjectID (UUID), Name, Description, StartDate, EndDate, Status, ClientID    | ProjectID        |                    |
| Document            | DocumentID (UUID), ProjectID, DocumentType, Title, Content, CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, Version, AIProviderID, Status | DocumentID       | ProjectID, AIProviderID |
| DocumentType        | DocumentTypeID (INT), Name, Description, TemplatePath                       | DocumentTypeID     |                    |
| AIProvider          | AIProviderID (INT), Name, EndpointURL, APIKey (Sensitive - stored securely) | AIProviderID      |                    |
| ContextSource       | ContextSourceID (UUID), ProjectID, FilePath, RelevanceScore (INT), Category (ENUM: Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other) | ContextSourceID | ProjectID          |
| DocumentValidation  | ValidationID (UUID), DocumentID, ValidationStatus (ENUM: Passed, Failed), ErrorMessages | ValidationID    | DocumentID         |


**Cardinality:**

* **Project 1:N Document:** One project can have many documents.
* **DocumentType 1:N Document:** One document type can be associated with many documents.
* **AIProvider 1:N Document:** One AI provider can generate many documents.
* **Project 1:N ContextSource:** One project can have many context sources.

**2. Data Model Recommendations**

* **Logical Data Model:** A relational model is recommended due to its maturity, scalability, and well-established tooling. The entities listed above represent the core tables.
* **Physical Implementation Considerations:**  Consider using a cloud-based relational database like PostgreSQL or Azure SQL Database for scalability and ease of management.  Partitioning might be beneficial for large projects with numerous documents and context sources.
* **Normalization Recommendations:**  The model aims for at least 3NF (Third Normal Form) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.
* **Index Strategy Suggestions:**  Indexes should be created on primary keys, foreign keys, and frequently queried attributes like `ProjectID`, `DocumentType`, `CreatedDate`, and `RelevanceScore`.


**3. Database Design Guidelines**

* **Table Structure Recommendations:**  Each entity in the ERD maps directly to a table.
* **Data Type Selections:**
    * `ProjectID`, `DocumentID`, `ContextSourceID`, `ValidationID`: UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)
    * `DocumentTypeID`, `AIProviderID`: INT (Integer)
    * `Name`, `Description`, `Title`, `FilePath`, `ErrorMessages`: VARCHAR (variable-length string, size appropriate to the data)
    * `Content`: TEXT or CLOB (for large text content)
    * `StartDate`, `EndDate`, `CreatedDate`, `LastModifiedDate`: TIMESTAMP
    * `RelevanceScore`: INT
    * `Status`: ENUM (for status tracking)
    * `Category`: ENUM (for context source categorization)
    * `APIKey`:  VARCHAR (Stored securely, ideally using database-level encryption)
* **Constraint Definitions:** Primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and NOT NULL constraints should be enforced on appropriate columns.  Data validation rules (see Data Governance) should be implemented via constraints or triggers where possible.
* **Performance Optimization Strategies:** Use appropriate indexing, query optimization techniques, and database tuning as needed. Consider caching frequently accessed data.


**4. Data Governance Framework**

* **Data Quality Standards:** Implement data validation rules to ensure data integrity. This includes checks for valid data types, ranges, and formats.  Regular data quality checks and audits should be performed.
* **Data Validation Rules:**
    * Ensure `Content` is not empty for documents.
    * Validate `RelevanceScore` is within a defined range (e.g., 0-100).
    * Check for valid `Status` and `Category` values.
    * Validate date formats for `StartDate`, `EndDate`, `CreatedDate`, and `LastModifiedDate`.
    * Ensure unique `ProjectID` and `DocumentID`.
* **Data Security Considerations:** Secure storage of sensitive data (API keys) is crucial. Use database-level encryption and access control mechanisms (roles and permissions).  Regular security audits are essential.
* **Backup and Recovery Strategies:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy, including regular backups, disaster recovery planning, and point-in-time recovery capabilities.


**5.  Extensions and Considerations for Future Development:**

* **User Management:** Integrate with an existing user management system (e.g., Azure Active Directory) to manage user accounts and permissions.  Add a `UserID` to the `Project` and potentially `Document` tables to track ownership and access.
* **Document Versioning:**  A more sophisticated versioning system might be needed for tracking changes to documents over time.  This could involve adding a version number and storing previous versions of the document content.
* **Advanced Search:** Implement a full-text search capability to efficiently search document content.
* **Document Collaboration:**  If collaboration features are added, consider adding fields to track user edits and timestamps.  Consider a more complex schema to support concurrent editing.
* **Metrics and Reporting:**  Add tables to track usage statistics (e.g., number of documents generated, AI provider usage, processing times).


This data model provides a solid foundation for the ADPA project.  The specific implementation details will depend on the chosen database system and the project's evolving requirements.  Regular review and refinement of the model will be essential as the project matures.
