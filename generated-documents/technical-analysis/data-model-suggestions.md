## Data Model for Requirements Gathering Agent

This data model focuses on storing project information, generated documents, and analysis results, supporting scalability and maintainability.  A hybrid approach using both relational (SQL) and NoSQL databases is recommended.

**I. Relational Database (SQL) - Project Metadata and Generated Documents**

This database will store structured data like project metadata, document metadata, and user information.  PostgreSQL or MySQL are suitable choices.

**A. Entities:**

1. **Projects:**
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `project_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    * `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Users)
    * `ai_provider` (VARCHAR(50))  //e.g., 'Azure OpenAI', 'Google Gemini', 'GitHub Copilot'
    * `ai_model` (VARCHAR(50)) //e.g., 'gpt-4', 'gemini-pro'
    * `project_path` (VARCHAR(255)) //Path to project directory

2. **Users:**
    * `user_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
    * `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
    * `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL) //Store securely hashed passwords

3. **Documents:**
    * `document_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `document_type` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL) //e.g., 'Project Charter', 'Stakeholder Register', 'Risk Management Plan'
    * `document_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
    * `generated_at` (TIMESTAMP, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    * `file_path` (VARCHAR(255)) //Path to generated document file
    * `document_content` (TEXT) //Store the generated document content (consider LOB for large documents)
    * `quality_score` (INT) //Score from 0-100
    * `pmbok_compliance_score` (INT) //Score from 0-100
    * `validation_report` (JSONB) //Store JSON validation report

4. **FilesAnalyzed:**
    * `analysis_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `file_path` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
    * `file_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL)
    * `relevance_score` (INT) //Score from 0-100
    * `category` (VARCHAR(50)) //'Primary', 'Planning', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Other'


**B. Relationships:**

* One-to-many between Users and Projects.
* One-to-many between Projects and Documents.
* One-to-many between Projects and FilesAnalyzed.


**C. Indexes:**

* Index on `project_id` in Documents table.
* Index on `user_id` in Projects table.
* Index on `document_type` in Documents table.
* Index on `project_id` and `file_path` in FilesAnalyzed table.


**D. Constraints:**

* `NOT NULL` constraints on relevant fields.
* Foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity.
* Check constraints to ensure scores are within 0-100 range.


**II. NoSQL Database (Document Database) -  Analysis Results and Context**

This database will store semi-structured and unstructured data like the raw text extracted from project files, context information used by the AI, and detailed analysis results. MongoDB is a good choice.

**A. Collections:**

1. **ProjectContext:**
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `context_data` (JSON) //Store all extracted text and metadata from files, organized by file.

2. **AnalysisResults:**
    * `analysis_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `analysis_timestamp` (DATE)
    * `analysis_details` (JSON) //Detailed analysis results including relevance scores, token counts, etc.


**III. Hybrid Approach Advantages:**

* **Scalability:** NoSQL handles unstructured data efficiently, while SQL manages structured data reliably.
* **Performance:**  Optimized for different data access patterns.
* **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns.
* **Flexibility:** Easily adaptable to future enhancements.


**IV. Entity-Relationship Diagram (Textual Representation):**

```
Projects *---1 Users
Projects 1---* Documents
Projects 1---* FilesAnalyzed
Projects 1---1 ProjectContext
Projects 1---* AnalysisResults
```


**V. Database Technology Recommendations:**

* **Relational:** PostgreSQL (preferred for its features and robustness) or MySQL (simpler to set up).
* **NoSQL:** MongoDB (popular and well-suited for document storage).


**VI. Scalability and Performance Considerations:**

* **Sharding:** For very large datasets, shard the SQL database based on `project_id`.
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
* **Indexing:**  Proper indexing is crucial for performance in both SQL and NoSQL databases.
* **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple database instances.


**VII. Data Security and Privacy Recommendations:**

* **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (especially passwords).
* **Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms (RBAC).
* **Data Validation:**  Sanitize user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
* **Regular Backups:**  Implement a reliable backup and recovery strategy.
* **Compliance:**  Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).


This detailed data model provides a solid foundation for the Requirements Gathering Agent. The specific implementation details might need adjustments based on further project requirements and constraints.  The choice of specific technologies should be driven by factors like existing infrastructure, team expertise, and budget constraints.
