# Acceptance Criteria: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, ensuring the final product meets the defined requirements and expectations.  Acceptance will be determined by successful completion of all criteria listed below, categorized by feature set.  Testing will be conducted using a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and manual user acceptance testing (UAT).

**I. Core Functionality (PMBOK Document Generation):**

* **A. Document Generation:**
    * **AC1.1:**  The system shall successfully generate all 29 PMBOK-compliant documents listed in the project documentation, given a valid README.md file as input.  Each document shall be in a separate file within the designated output directory.
    * **AC1.2:** The generated documents shall accurately reflect the information contained within the input README.md file and any supplementary markdown files discovered by the project analysis engine.
    * **AC1.3:** The system shall handle missing or incomplete information in the input README.md gracefully, providing informative messages to the user and generating the most complete documents possible given the available data.
    * **AC1.4:**  Generated documents shall adhere to the specified output format (markdown, JSON, YAML) as selected by the user via command-line options.
    * **AC1.5:** All generated documents shall follow PMBOK 7.0 standards and best practices.

* **B. Project Analysis Engine:**
    * **AC2.1:** The system shall automatically discover and analyze all relevant markdown files within the specified project directory (including subdirectories up to three levels deep), excluding system folders.
    * **AC2.2:** The project analysis engine shall assign a relevance score (0-100) to each discovered file based on content relevance, file location, naming patterns, content structure, and content depth.
    * **AC2.3:** The system shall accurately categorize discovered files into the defined categories: Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, and Other.
    * **AC2.4:** The system shall prioritize high-scoring, relevant documentation sources for context building.
    * **AC2.5:**  The system shall provide a report detailing the discovered files, their relevance scores, and categorization.

* **C. Context Management:**
    * **AC3.1:** The Enhanced Context Manager shall effectively manage and utilize project context for AI model input, maximizing context utilization for the chosen AI model.
    * **AC3.2:** The system shall adapt its context strategy (Core Context, Ultra-Large Model Support, Large Model Supplementary) based on the selected AI model and its token limits.
    * **AC3.3:** The system shall provide detailed reporting on context utilization, including the number of tokens used and the percentage of the modelâ€™s context window utilized.
    * **AC3.4:** The system shall handle potential token overflow gracefully, prioritizing the most relevant information for inclusion in the context.


**II. Advanced Features:**

* **A. Technical Design Document System:**
    * **AC4.1:** The system shall generate all 10 types of technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, etc.) using specialized AI prompts and professional templates.
    * **AC4.2:** Each technical document shall be structurally sound and contain relevant, high-quality technical information extracted from the project context.
    * **AC4.3:** The `--generate-technical` command shall generate all technical design documents, while individual commands (`--generate architecturedesign`, etc.) shall generate the specified document type.

* **B. Business Communication Translator:**
    * **AC5.1:** The system shall generate professional, context-appropriate strategic documents such as Company Values and Purpose Statements.
    * **AC5.2:** Generated strategic documents shall reflect the project's mission, capabilities, and overall context.
    * **AC5.3:** The generated documents shall be of professional quality, suitable for executive presentations and corporate websites.

* **C. Version Control System:**
    * **AC6.1:**  A local Git repository shall be automatically initialized within the `generated-documents` directory on first run (if one doesn't already exist).
    * **AC6.2:** All generated documents shall be automatically version-controlled, with commits including timestamps and model information.
    * **AC6.3:** The CLI VCS commands (`vcs log`, `vcs diff`, `vcs revert`, `vcs status`, `vcs push`, `vcs pull`) shall function correctly.

* **D. PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:**
    * **AC7.1:** The system shall validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
    * **AC7.2:** The validation process shall identify missing or incomplete elements and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.
    * **AC7.3:**  A comprehensive validation report shall be generated, including overall compliance status, consistency scores, and individual document quality scores.

* **E. Multiple AI Provider Support:**
    * **AC8.1:** The system shall successfully integrate with and utilize Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama, as configured in the `.env` file.
    * **AC8.2:**  The system shall handle provider failures gracefully, with appropriate error messages and fallback mechanisms.


**III. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **A. Performance:** The system shall generate all documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined based on testing).
* **B. Security:** The system shall securely handle API keys and sensitive information according to best practices.
* **C. Usability:** The CLI shall be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and helpful error messages.
* **D. Reliability:** The system shall be reliable and robust, with appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.
* **E. Maintainability:** The codebase shall be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and extend.


**IV.  Acceptance Testing:**

Acceptance testing will involve a comprehensive suite of tests, including:

* **Unit Tests:**  Thorough testing of individual components and modules.
* **Integration Tests:**  Verification of interactions between different system components.
* **UAT:**  Manual testing by end-users to ensure the system meets their needs and expectations.  Specific test cases will be developed based on user stories and scenarios.


This acceptance criteria document serves as a living document and may be updated as the project progresses.  Any changes will be communicated to all stakeholders.
