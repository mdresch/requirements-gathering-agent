# Acceptance Criteria: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, ensuring the system meets the defined requirements and delivers the promised value.  Acceptance will be determined through a combination of automated testing, manual testing, and stakeholder review.

## I. API Functionality

**A. Document Generation API (`/api/v1/documents/convert`)**

1. **Successful Generation:**  Given valid input data (JSON conforming to the defined schema) and a valid API key, the API shall generate a BABOK v3 compliant requirements document within 2 seconds (95th percentile latency).  The generated document shall be accessible via the provided download URL.  The document's content shall accurately reflect the input data, including stakeholder analysis, regulatory compliance considerations, and  requirements elicitation details.

2. **Error Handling:** Given invalid input data (e.g., missing fields, incorrect data types), the API shall return a descriptive error message (JSON format) with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 422 Unprocessable Entity).  The error message should clearly indicate the nature and location of the error.

3. **Authentication:** The API shall require a valid API key for all requests.  Unauthorized requests (missing or invalid API keys) shall return a 401 Unauthorized response.

4. **Rate Limiting:**  The API shall implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.  Exceeding the rate limit shall result in a 429 Too Many Requests response.

5. **Output Formats:**  The API shall support generating documents in at least the following formats:  Markdown (.md), PDF (.pdf), and DOCX (.docx).  Generated files must be correctly formatted and easily readable.

6. **Job Management:** The API shall provide mechanisms to track the status of document generation jobs (via GET `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`).  The status should reflect job initiation, progress, completion, or failure.


**B. Template Management API (`/api/v1/templates`)**

1. **CRUD Operations:**  The API shall support the full range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for templates.  All operations shall be protected by authentication.

2. **Schema Validation:** Templates shall be validated against a predefined schema to ensure data integrity.  Invalid templates shall be rejected with an appropriate error message.

3. **Template Retrieval:**  The API shall successfully retrieve specific templates based on their unique ID.  Non-existent templates shall return a 404 Not Found response.

4. **Template Listing:**  The API shall list available templates, including metadata (name, description, category, tags).


**C.  General API Requirements**

1. **API Documentation:**  Comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specification shall be provided and readily accessible.

2. **Logging:**  The API shall include robust logging capabilities, recording all requests, responses, and errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.

3. **Security:** The API shall adhere to industry best practices for security, including protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).


## II. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:** The API shall maintain an average response time of under 1 second for document generation (90th percentile latency), and under 0.5 seconds for other API endpoints (90th percentile latency), under typical load conditions.

2. **Scalability:** The API architecture shall be designed to scale horizontally to handle increased load and user demand.

3. **Reliability:** The API shall maintain high availability and minimal downtime.

4. **Maintainability:** The codebase shall be well-documented, modular, and easy to maintain and extend.

5. **Usability:** The API's design and documentation shall be intuitive and easy to use for developers.


## III. Stakeholder Acceptance

1. **Fortune 500 Validation:** The system shall successfully generate a BABOK v3 compliant requirements document for a representative Fortune 500 company scenario (similar complexity to the provided "GlobalBank" example) within the specified performance constraints.

2. **Stakeholder Review:**  Key stakeholders (including business analysts and project managers) shall review the generated documents and confirm their accuracy, completeness, and compliance with BABOK v3 standards.


## IV.  Deployment & Infrastructure

1. **Production Readiness:** The API shall be deployed in a production-ready environment with appropriate monitoring and alerting mechanisms in place.

2. **Documentation:** Comprehensive deployment and operational documentation shall be provided.


This acceptance criteria document serves as a living document and may be updated as the project progresses.  Any changes will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
