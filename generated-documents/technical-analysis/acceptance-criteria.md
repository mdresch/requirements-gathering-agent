## Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

The following acceptance criteria detail the conditions that must be met for successful project completion.  They are grouped by feature and utilize the Given-When-Then format.  Performance and non-functional requirements are also included where applicable.

**I. Comprehensive PMBOK Document Suite Generation:**

* **Requirement:** The system shall generate 29 PMBOK-compliant documents.

    * **Given** a valid project README.md file and supporting documentation in standard locations,
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed,
    * **Then** 29 distinct PMBOK documents (as listed in the README's "Generated Documents" section) are generated in the specified output directory.  Each document shall be a valid markdown file (`.md`) unless a different format (`--format json|yaml`) is specified.
    * **And** each document shall contain at least the minimum required elements according to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
    * **And** the generated documents shall be correctly categorized into the specified directory structure.
    * **Edge Case:** If insufficient information is available in the input files, the system shall generate placeholder documents with appropriate warnings or placeholders indicating missing data.
    * **Performance:** Document generation time should not exceed 5 minutes for projects with less than 100KB of total input documentation.  For larger projects, a progress indicator should be displayed.

* **Requirement:** Documents must be PMBOK 7.0 compliant.

    * **Given** a set of generated PMBOK documents,
    * **When** PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation (`--validate-pmbok` flag) is performed,
    * **Then** a compliance report is generated identifying any missing or incomplete sections according to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  The report shall provide actionable recommendations for improvement.  A compliance score (0-100) should be provided. A score of 85 or higher indicates acceptable compliance.
    * **Edge Case:**  The system should gracefully handle invalid or incomplete PMBOK templates.


**II. Enhanced Project Analysis:**

* **Requirement:** The system shall analyze all markdown files beyond README.md.

    * **Given** a project directory containing multiple markdown files in standard locations (as defined in the README's "Intelligent Source Discovery" section),
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed,
    * **Then** the system shall identify and analyze all relevant markdown files within the project directory, up to three levels deep.  The system should accurately identify and exclude system directories and generated files.
    * **And** the system shall output a report detailing the discovered files, their categorization (Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other), and relevance scores (0-100).
    * **Edge Case:** The system should handle files with unexpected formats or invalid markdown gracefully, without crashing.  A warning should be logged for such files.
    * **Performance:** Analysis time should be proportional to the size and complexity of the project directory, but should not exceed 2 minutes for projects with less than 50 files.


* **Requirement:**  Files are scored based on relevance.

    * **Given** a set of markdown files with varying levels of relevance to PMBOK concepts,
    * **When** the project analysis is performed,
    * **Then** each file is assigned a relevance score (0-100) based on content relevance, file location, naming patterns, content structure, and content depth.  Higher scores should indicate greater relevance to project management concepts.
    * **And** the system shall prioritize high-scoring files during context building.


**III. Intelligent Context Building:**

* **Requirement:** The system shall build context from multiple sources.

    * **Given** multiple relevant markdown files with varying relevance scores,
    * **When** the document generation process begins,
    * **Then** the system shall integrate content from multiple markdown files beyond README.md to build a comprehensive project context.  The system shall prioritize high-scoring sources.
    * **And** the system shall balance context size to avoid token overflow while maximizing information.  A detailed report on context utilization should be provided.
    * **Edge Case:** If the total context exceeds the model's token limit, the system shall intelligently prioritize and truncate the context, giving preference to higher-scoring files.


**IV. Azure OpenAI Integration and Authentication:**

* **Requirement:** The system shall integrate with Azure OpenAI.

    * **Given** valid Azure OpenAI credentials are provided in a `.env` file,
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed,
    * **Then** the system shall successfully connect to Azure OpenAI using the provided credentials and generate documents using the specified model.
    * **And** the system shall handle authentication errors gracefully, providing informative error messages.
    * **Edge Case:**  The system should gracefully handle network connectivity issues and API rate limits, implementing retry logic with exponential backoff.


**V. Multiple AI Provider Support:**

* **Requirement:** The system shall support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).

    * **Given** valid credentials for any of the supported AI providers are configured,
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed,
    * **Then** the system shall correctly identify and utilize the selected provider for document generation.
    * **And** the system shall seamlessly switch between providers without requiring code changes.
    * **Edge Case:**  If a specified provider is unavailable or fails, the system shall gracefully fall back to a default provider or report an appropriate error.


**VI. Enhanced Context Manager:**

* **Requirement:** The Enhanced Context Manager shall improve context utilization.

    * **Given** a large project with extensive documentation,
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed,
    * **Then** the Enhanced Context Manager shall utilize at least 20% of the available context window for GPT-4 and at least 50% for Gemini models, resulting in more accurate and detailed documentation.  A detailed context report should be generated indicating utilization and performance.
    * **And** the system shall automatically detect and optimize for the capabilities of different AI models.


**VII. Command-Line Interface (CLI):**

* **Requirement:** The CLI shall provide various options.

    * **Given** the various CLI options (as listed in the README),
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed with different options,
    * **Then** the system shall correctly interpret and execute the specified options.  This includes generating specific document subsets, enabling validation, specifying output formats, and controlling verbosity.


**VIII. Error Handling and Retry Logic:**

* **Requirement:** The system shall implement robust error handling and retry logic.

    * **Given** various error conditions (network issues, API errors, file access errors),
    * **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed,
    * **Then** the system shall handle errors gracefully, logging appropriate messages, and attempting retries where appropriate (using the `--with-retry` flag).  The system should not crash.  Informative error messages should be provided.


**IX. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:** The system should be responsive and efficient.  Specific performance targets are defined within individual functional requirements.
* **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities.
* **Security:** The system should securely handle API keys and sensitive information.  Authentication and authorization should be properly implemented.
* **Usability:** The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use.  Clear documentation and usage examples should be provided.
* **Maintainability:** The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.


These acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive framework for testing and validating the Requirements Gathering Agent.  They ensure that the system meets its functional and non-functional requirements, delivering a robust and reliable solution for automated project documentation generation.
