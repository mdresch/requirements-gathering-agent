# Acceptance Criteria: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, ensuring the successful delivery of a production-ready API adhering to BABOK v3 standards and meeting enterprise-level requirements.  Acceptance will be determined through a combination of automated testing, manual verification, and stakeholder review.

## I. Functional Requirements

These criteria ensure the system performs its intended functions correctly.

**A. API Functionality:**

1. **Document Generation:** The `/api/v1/documents/convert` endpoint must successfully generate a BABOK v3 compliant framework document within 5 seconds for a dataset equivalent in complexity to the `test-data/fortune500-globalbank-data.json` file.  The generated document must be in the requested format (JSON, initially; PDF, DOCX, and HTML in subsequent phases).  Failure must result in a comprehensive error response with appropriate HTTP status codes and detailed error messages.

2. **Job Management:** The `/api/v1/documents/jobs` endpoint must accurately list all active and completed document generation jobs, including job status (e.g., pending, processing, completed, failed), start time, and completion time.  The `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status` endpoint must return the status of a specific job.

3. **Template Management:** The `/api/v1/templates` endpoint must allow for the creation, retrieval, and updating of custom templates in a structured JSON format.  Validation must ensure that templates adhere to a predefined schema.

4. **Download Functionality:** The `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}` endpoint must allow the download of generated documents with appropriate content-type headers.


**B. Business Analysis Framework:**

1. **BABOK v3 Compliance:**  The generated framework must strictly adhere to the BABOK v3 standard, verifiable through a comprehensive validation process against the standard's guidelines.  A specific compliance checklist will be used for verification.

2. **Stakeholder Analysis:**  The system must accurately identify and analyze stakeholder relationships and influence within the provided input data.  The output should reflect the stakeholder ecosystem mapping, including identification of key stakeholders and their influence levels.

3. **Regulatory Compliance:** The system must automatically incorporate relevant regulatory requirements (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX) based on the input data's context.  This integration must be verifiable through automated checks against predefined regulatory compliance rules.

4. **Requirements Elicitation:** The generated framework must accurately capture and represent the requirements elicited from the input data, demonstrating a clear and structured representation of the business needs.


## II. Non-Functional Requirements

These criteria address the system's performance, security, and usability.

**A. Performance:**

1. **Response Time:** API endpoints must have an average response time of under 5 seconds for datasets comparable to the `fortune500-globalbank-data.json` file under normal load conditions.  Load testing will be performed to verify this.

2. **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a concurrent load of at least 100 requests without significant performance degradation.  This will be verified through load testing.

**B. Security:**

1. **Authentication:** API key authentication must be robust and prevent unauthorized access.  Security testing will be conducted to verify its effectiveness.

2. **Rate Limiting:**  Rate limiting must be implemented to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.  Testing will verify the effectiveness of the rate-limiting mechanism.

3. **Input Validation:** The system must perform comprehensive input validation to prevent injection attacks and handle invalid input gracefully.  Automated testing will ensure that all inputs are properly validated.

**C. Usability:**

1. **API Documentation:**  Comprehensive and well-structured API documentation (OpenAPI 3.0 specification) must be provided.

2. **Error Handling:**  Error messages must be clear, concise, and informative, providing sufficient detail to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.


## III. Stakeholder Acceptance

1. **Fortune 500 Validation:** The system must successfully generate a high-quality BABOK v3 framework from a real-world Fortune 500-level dataset, deemed acceptable by a subject matter expert (SME) in business analysis.

2. **SME Review:**  A designated SME will review the generated output for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to BABOK v3 best practices.  Acceptance will be based on the SMEâ€™s approval.


## IV.  Deployment & Maintenance

1. **Production Readiness:** The API must be deployed to a production-ready environment and meet all operational requirements for stability and reliability.

2. **Monitoring & Logging:**  Comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities must be in place to track system performance and identify potential issues.


This acceptance criteria document serves as a living document and may be updated as the project progresses.  Any changes will be communicated to all stakeholders.
