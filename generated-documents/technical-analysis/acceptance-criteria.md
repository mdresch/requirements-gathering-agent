# Acceptance Criteria

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  Successful completion requires meeting all criteria outlined below.  These criteria are categorized for clarity.

**I. Functional Requirements:**

* **FR1: PMBOK Document Generation:** The system shall generate PMBOK-compliant documents, including but not limited to: Project Charters, Stakeholder Registers, Scope Management Plans, Risk Management Plans, and Work Breakdown Structures.  These documents must adhere to the latest PMBOK standard (specify version).  Acceptance will be determined by a review of generated documents against a PMBOK checklist (Appendix A).

* **FR2: AI Provider Integration:** The system shall successfully integrate with at least three AI providers: OpenAI, Google AI, and one other (specify, e.g., Azure OpenAI).  Integration must be robust, handling provider failures gracefully and providing fallback mechanisms.  Acceptance will be demonstrated by successful document generation using each integrated provider.  Error handling and fallback mechanisms will be tested (Appendix B).

* **FR3: JSON Output:** The system shall output all generated documents in valid JSON format, adhering to a predefined schema (Appendix C).  Acceptance will be determined by automated schema validation against each generated document.

* **FR4: CLI Interface:** The system shall provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) allowing users to specify input parameters (e.g., project name, AI provider, document type), manage configurations, and initiate document generation.  Acceptance will be determined by successful execution of CLI commands and generation of expected output based on various input parameters (Appendix D).

* **FR5: Modular Architecture:** The system shall be designed with a modular architecture, allowing for future expansion and integration with third-party project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).  Acceptance will be demonstrated through the existence of well-defined modules with clear interfaces and documentation.

* **FR6: User Documentation:** Comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and examples, shall be provided to facilitate onboarding and ongoing use.  Acceptance will be based on a review of the documentation's clarity, completeness, and accuracy.

* **FR7:  Template-Based Document Creation:** The system shall support template-based document creation.  Users should be able to create, edit, and utilize custom templates to generate documents.  Acceptance will be determined by successful creation, saving, loading, and use of custom templates to generate documents.  Functionality for template management must also be verified.


**II. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **NF1: Performance:** Document generation time for a typical project charter shall not exceed (specify time, e.g., 60 seconds).  Performance testing results will be documented (Appendix E).

* **NF2: Scalability:** The system shall be able to handle (specify number, e.g., 10) concurrent document generation requests without significant performance degradation.  Load testing results will be documented (Appendix E).

* **NF3: Security:**  While explicitly excluded from the initial scope (as per PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD), the system's architecture must allow for future integration of security features without significant refactoring.  Documentation outlining the security considerations and future implementation plan is required (Appendix F).

* **NF4: Usability:** The CLI interface must be intuitive and easy to use, requiring minimal training. User feedback from usability testing will be documented (Appendix G).

* **NF5: Maintainability:** The codebase shall be well-documented, following consistent coding style and best practices.  Code maintainability will be assessed using code quality metrics (Appendix H).


**III.  Internationalization and Compliance:**

* **INT1: International Footprint:** The system's design must accommodate future localization and adaptation to different international standards and regulations.  A plan for future internationalization will be included (Appendix I).

* **COMP1: Regulatory Compliance:**  The system will not contain any features that violate known banking industry legislation or regulations (specific legislation to be detailed in Appendix J).  A compliance review will be conducted.


**IV.  Acceptance Testing:**

Acceptance testing will involve a combination of unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).  All tests must pass before the system is considered accepted.  Test plans and results will be documented (Appendices B-H).
