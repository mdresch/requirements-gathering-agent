## Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

These acceptance criteria are structured using the Given-When-Then format and categorized by feature.  They address both functional and non-functional requirements, including normal operation, edge cases, performance, and data integrity.


**I. Core Functionality: PMBOK Document Generation**

**A. Project Charter Generation:**

* **Given** a valid project README.md file containing basic project information (title, goals, stakeholders).
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** a valid PMBOK-compliant Project Charter document (e.g., `generated-documents/project-charter/project-charter.md`) is generated containing all required fields as defined in PMBOK 7.0.  The document should accurately reflect the information provided in the README.md.
* **Given** a README.md file with missing or incomplete information.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool should generate a Project Charter with placeholders or warnings for missing information, and clearly indicate the missing data.  Generation should not fail.
* **Given** a very large README file exceeding 100k characters.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the Project Charter is generated within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 60 seconds).  The tool should handle large input gracefully without crashing.


**B.  Other PMBOK Document Generation:**

* **Given** a valid project README.md and supporting documentation (as specified in the README's “Intelligent Source Discovery” section).
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed with appropriate flags (e.g., `--generate-stakeholder`, `--generate-planning`, etc.).
* **Then** all specified PMBOK documents are generated in the appropriate subdirectories within `generated-documents/`.  Each document should be structurally sound, PMBOK 7.0 compliant, and contain relevant information extracted from the input sources.
* **Given**  invalid or corrupted input files (e.g., malformed markdown, non-UTF8 encoding).
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool should gracefully handle the errors, log appropriate messages, skip the problematic files, and continue generating documents for the valid files. The generation should not fail completely.


**II. Enhanced Project Analysis**

**A. Source Discovery:**

* **Given** a project directory structure containing files in the specified locations for requirements, architecture, stakeholders, and planning documents (as detailed in the README).
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool should successfully discover and analyze all relevant files, reporting the number of files found and their categorization.
* **Given** a project with unusual directory structures or file naming conventions.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool should discover and analyze as many relevant files as possible, providing a report indicating files that were excluded and the reason for exclusion.

**B. Relevance Scoring:**

* **Given** a set of files with varying relevance to PMBOK concepts.
* **When** the tool analyzes these files.
* **Then** the relevance scores (0-100) should reflect the actual relevance of each file's content to PMBOK terminology and project management concepts.  Scores should be consistently applied and justifiable.


**III. Enhanced Context Manager**

**A. Context Utilization:**

* **Given** different AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro) with varying token limits.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool should automatically select the appropriate context strategy (as detailed in the README) and achieve the target context utilization rates for each model.  A report should be generated detailing the context utilization for each document and the overall project.
* **Given** a project with extremely large amounts of documentation exceeding the token limits of even the largest models.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the system should intelligently summarize or prioritize the most relevant information to fit within the token limits, providing a warning to the user about potential information loss.


**B.  3-Phase Context Strategy:**

* **Given** a project with varying amounts of documentation.
* **When** the tool generates documents.
* **Then** the tool should correctly apply the 3-phase context strategy (Core, Ultra-Large, Large Supplementary) based on the AI model and the available context.  The selection of context should be logged and verifiable.


**IV.  Version Control System (VCS)**

* **Given** the `requirements-gathering-agent` is executed.
* **When** documents are generated or updated.
* **Then** changes are automatically committed to the local Git repository within `generated-documents/`.  Commit messages should include timestamps and relevant information (e.g., AI model used).
* **Given** the VCS commands (`vcs log`, `vcs diff`, `vcs revert`, etc.) are executed.
* **When** the commands are used.
* **Then** these commands should function correctly, allowing for review of commit history, viewing diffs, and reverting to previous versions of generated documents.  The behavior should be consistent with standard Git commands.

**V.  Modular Processor Architecture**

* **Given** a new document processor is implemented and registered according to the specified guidelines.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the new document type should be generated correctly, without affecting other existing document generation processes.  This should be verifiable by testing.


**VI.  Non-Functional Requirements**

* **Performance:** The tool should generate all documents within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 5 minutes for average-sized projects), with clear progress indicators.
* **Error Handling:** The tool should gracefully handle errors (e.g., API request failures, invalid input files), providing informative error messages and attempting retries where appropriate.
* **Security:** The tool should securely manage API keys and credentials, following best practices for authentication and authorization.
* **Usability:** The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear documentation and help messages.  The output documents should be well-formatted and easy to read.
* **Scalability:** The tool should be able to handle projects of varying sizes and complexity without performance degradation.
* **Maintainability:** The codebase should be well-structured, documented, and testable to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.


These acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive framework for verifying the functionality and quality of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Specific timeframes and performance metrics should be defined based on testing and performance analysis during development.  The specific acceptance criteria for the new "Project KickOff Preparations Checklist" feature should follow the same format and level of detail as the examples above.
