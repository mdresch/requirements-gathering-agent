## Acceptance Criteria: Requirements Gathering Agent

These acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for the Requirements Gathering Agent to be considered successfully implemented and ready for release.  They are categorized for clarity and cover functionality, performance, security, and usability.

**I. Functionality:**

* **Document Generation:**
    * **Completeness:**  The tool successfully generates all 28 PMBOK documents as listed in the documentation when invoked without any command-line arguments. (`requirements-gathering-agent`)
    * **Core Documents:** The `--core-only` flag successfully generates only the core analysis documents (Project Summary, User Stories, User Personas, Key Roles).
    * **Selective Generation:**  Each command-line flag (`--management-plans`, `--planning-artifacts`, `--technical-analysis`) correctly generates only the specified document subset.
    * **Document Content:**  Each generated document is relevant, coherent, and reasonably complete based on the provided README.md input.  Content should reflect PMBOK best practices.  This will require subjective evaluation and may involve expert review.
    * **File Structure:** The generated documents are organized according to the specified directory structure.
    * **README.md Generation:** A master `README.md` file is generated in the root directory, acting as an index for all generated documents.
    * **Format:** Documents are generated in a consistent, readable format (e.g., Markdown).

* **AI Provider Integration:**
    * **Azure OpenAI:**  Successful document generation using Azure OpenAI with Entra ID authentication.
    * **Google AI Studio:** Successful document generation using Google AI Studio API.
    * **GitHub AI:** Successful document generation using GitHub AI.
    * **Ollama:** Successful document generation using a locally running Ollama instance.
    * **Provider Switching:** Seamless switching between AI providers via the `.env` file.  The tool should gracefully handle incorrect or missing API keys/credentials.

* **Error Handling and Retry Logic:**
    * **Error Reporting:** The tool provides informative error messages for API failures, file I/O errors, and other exceptions.
    * **Retry Mechanism:** The `--with-retry` flag successfully implements retry logic for failed API calls, with configurable retry attempts and delays.  The number of retries and delay should be configurable (perhaps via environment variables).
    * **Graceful Degradation:** If an AI provider fails completely, the tool should gracefully exit without crashing and provide a clear explanation.

**II. Performance:**

* **Execution Time:** The tool should generate all documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined, e.g., under 5 minutes for a typical README).  This should be tested with various README file sizes and complexities.
* **Resource Consumption:** The tool should not consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory).  Performance testing should be conducted under varying load conditions.

**III. Security:**

* **API Key Management:** API keys are handled securely and are not hardcoded in the application.
* **Authentication:** Secure authentication methods are implemented for each AI provider.  The tool should not expose sensitive information in error messages or logs.
* **Input Sanitization:** The tool should sanitize README input to prevent injection attacks.

**IV. Usability:**

* **Command-Line Interface:** The CLI is intuitive and easy to use, with clear help messages and options.
* **Documentation:** The documentation is clear, comprehensive, and easy to understand.  It should include clear examples and instructions for all features.
* **Error Messages:** Error messages are user-friendly and provide helpful information for troubleshooting.


**V.  Testing:**

* **Unit Tests:**  Comprehensive unit tests covering core functionality and error handling.  High test coverage (e.g., >90%) is required.
* **Integration Tests:**  Tests verifying the integration with each AI provider and the correct generation of documents.
* **End-to-End Tests:**  Tests simulating a complete workflow from input README to the generation of all documents in the correct structure.


**VI.  Deployment:**

* **Package:** The npm package is properly structured and includes all necessary files and metadata.
* **Installation:** The tool can be easily installed globally or using `npx`.


These acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive framework for validating the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Specific thresholds for performance metrics (execution time, resource consumption) should be determined based on testing and realistic usage scenarios.  The subjective evaluation of document content quality will require a defined rubric or the involvement of subject matter experts in project management.
