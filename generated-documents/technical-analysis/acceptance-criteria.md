# Acceptance Criteria: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Acceptance will be determined by successful completion and verification of the criteria listed below.  Each criterion is categorized for clarity and traceability.

**I. Core Functionality:**

* **A. PMBOK Document Generation:**
    * **AC1.1:** The system shall generate a complete set of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents (minimum 29 documents as listed in the project README) from a provided project README.md file and any discovered supporting documentation.
    * **AC1.2:**  Generated documents shall adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards for content, structure, and terminology.  A PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation report will be generated for each document, scoring each document individually and overall.  A score of 90/100 or higher will be considered compliant for acceptance.
    * **AC1.3:** The system shall provide options to generate specific subsets of documents (e.g., core documents, management plans, stakeholder documents) via command-line arguments.
    * **AC1.4:**  Generated documents shall be free of grammatical errors and factual inconsistencies.  Any detected inconsistencies will be reported in the validation report.
    * **AC1.5:** The system shall offer a markdown output format, with options for JSON and YAML in future releases.

* **B. Enhanced Project Analysis:**
    * **AC2.1:** The system shall automatically discover and analyze at least 80% of relevant markdown files within a specified project directory (including subdirectories up to three levels deep), excluding standard system directories (e.g., `node_modules`, `.git`).
    * **AC2.2:** Each discovered file shall be assigned a relevance score (0-100) based on content relevance, file location, naming patterns, content structure, and depth, with a clear explanation of the scoring methodology provided in the documentation.
    * **AC2.3:** The system shall categorize discovered files into meaningful categories (Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other) based on content analysis and file location.  This categorization shall be documented and readily accessible to the user.
    * **AC2.4:** The system shall prioritize relevant documentation sources for context building, weighting higher-scoring files more heavily in the context generation process.


* **C. Enhanced Context Management:**
    * **AC3.1:** The system shall utilize an intelligent 3-phase context strategy, adapting to the capabilities of the selected AI model (token limits) to maximize context utilization.  A context utilization report shall be generated detailing the strategy employed and the percentage of tokens used.
    * **AC3.2:** For large language models with token limits exceeding 200,000, the system shall utilize at least 50% of the available context window. For models with limits above 1,000,000, the system shall utilize at least 80% of the available context window.
    * **AC3.3:** The system shall provide detailed reporting and analytics on context performance, including token usage, model type, and performance recommendations.

* **D.  Multiple AI Provider Support:**
    * **AC4.1:** The system shall seamlessly integrate with at least three different AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and one other, e.g., Ollama or GitHub AI).
    * **AC4.2:**  The system shall allow users to select the AI provider via a configuration file or command-line argument.  The system shall provide feedback on the availability and suitability of chosen providers.
    * **AC4.3:** The system shall implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in case of provider failures.


* **E. Technical Design Document Generation:**
    * **AC5.1:** The system shall generate 10 distinct types of technical design documents (as specified in the README) with accurate and relevant content.
    * **AC5.2:** Generated technical documents shall follow professional, comprehensive markdown templates, including executive summaries, detailed specifications, and implementation guidelines.
    * **AC5.3:** Each technical document type shall employ document-specific AI prompts for optimal content generation.
    * **AC5.4:**  The system shall provide command-line options for generating individual technical documents or the complete suite.

* **F. Business Communication Translation:**
    * **AC6.1:** The system shall generate professional-grade strategic business documents (Company Values, Purpose Statements, etc.) that accurately reflect the project's mission and capabilities.
    * **AC6.2:** Generated strategic documents shall be of executive-ready quality and suitable for use in presentations and corporate communications.


**II. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **A. Performance:**
    * **AC7.1:**  The system shall generate a complete set of PMBOK documents within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 60 seconds for small to medium-sized projects).  Performance testing will be conducted to establish acceptable benchmarks.
    * **AC7.2:** The system shall handle large project contexts efficiently without significant performance degradation.

* **B. Usability:**
    * **AC8.1:** The system shall have a clear and intuitive command-line interface with comprehensive help documentation.
    * **AC8.2:**  The system shall provide informative progress messages during document generation.

* **C. Maintainability:**
    * **AC9.1:** The system's codebase shall be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain.  Code quality will be assessed using automated tools.
    * **AC9.2:**  The system shall utilize a modular architecture that facilitates future expansion and maintenance.

* **D. Security:**
    * **AC10.1:** The system shall securely handle API keys and sensitive information using appropriate methods (e.g., environment variables, secure configuration files).
    * **AC10.2:**  (Where applicable based on chosen integration) SharePoint and Confluence integrations shall adhere to security best practices for authentication and authorization.


**III.  Version Control:**

* **AC11.1:** The system shall maintain a local Git repository for all generated documents, automatically versioning each change with appropriate commit messages.
* **AC11.2:**  The system shall provide command-line tools for viewing commit history, viewing diffs, and reverting to previous versions.  (Optional) Remote repository synchronization will be implemented in a future release.


**IV. Error Handling and Reporting:**

* **AC12.1:** The system shall handle errors gracefully and provide informative error messages to the user.
* **AC12.2:** The system shall provide comprehensive logging for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.  Logs shall be easily accessible to the user.
* **AC12.3:**  The system shall generate detailed validation and quality assessment reports that clearly identify any issues or areas for improvement.


Acceptance testing will be performed using a combination of automated tests and manual reviews.  A formal sign-off will be required from stakeholders upon successful completion of all acceptance criteria.
