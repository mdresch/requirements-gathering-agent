# **Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent**

Below are the detailed acceptance criteria grouped by feature, aligned with the provided project context. Each criterion is formatted using the **Given-When-Then** structure and includes conditions for normal behavior, edge cases, performance requirements, business rules, and state requirements.

   - **GIVEN** the tool is installed and executed with valid input data  
   - **WHEN** the user runs the CLI command `requirements-gathering-agent --generate-core`  
   - **THEN** the system must generate a PMBOK-compliant project charter in a markdown file located in the `generated-documents/project-charter` directory.

2. **Stakeholder Register Generation**  
   - **GIVEN** the project contains valid stakeholder information in `stakeholders.md` or other relevant files  
   - **WHEN** the user runs the CLI command `requirements-gathering-agent --generate-stakeholder`  
   - **THEN** the system must generate a stakeholder register with all identified stakeholders, their roles, interests, and influence levels.

3. **Edge Case: Missing Inputs for Core Documents**  
   - **GIVEN** the CLI is executed in a project directory without a README.md or stakeholder file  
   - **WHEN** the user runs the command `requirements-gathering-agent --generate-core`  
   - **THEN** the system must notify the user of missing inputs and provide actionable error messages suggesting required files.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria: PMBOK Compliance Validation**
1. **Validation of Generated Documents**  
   - **GIVEN** the PMBOK validation flag is enabled with the CLI command `requirements-gathering-agent --validate-pmbok`  
   - **WHEN** the system analyzes the generated documents  
   - **THEN** all documents must adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards, including required sections, terminology usage, and compliance with performance domains.  

2. **Quality Scoring**  
   - **GIVEN** a set of documents is validated  
   - **WHEN** the system runs quality checks using `requirements-gathering-agent --quality-assessment`  
   - **THEN** each document must receive a quality score (0–100) based on completeness, structure, relevance, and terminology alignment.  

3. **Consistency Check Across Documents**  
   - **GIVEN** multiple documents are generated  
   - **WHEN** the user runs `requirements-gathering-agent --validate-consistency`  
   - **THEN** the system must ensure cross-document consistency, including shared terminology, project goals, and stakeholder details.

## **Feature: Enhanced Context Management**

### **Acceptance Criteria: Intelligent Context Building**
1. **Source Discovery**  
   - **GIVEN** a project with multiple markdown files in standard directories (`docs/`, `requirements/`, etc.)  
   - **WHEN** the user runs `requirements-gathering-agent`  
   - **THEN** the system must discover and prioritize files based on relevance scores (0–100), categorizing them into primary, planning, development, and documentation context groups.  

2. **Token Allocation Optimization**  
   - **GIVEN** the system uses a large language model with a token limit (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro)  
   - **WHEN** the Enhanced Context Manager builds the context  
   - **THEN** at least 90% of the token capacity must be utilized for ultra-large models, while maintaining a buffer for response generation.

3. **Edge Case: Excessive Context Size**  
   - **GIVEN** a project contains more markdown files than the token limit allows  
   - **WHEN** the Enhanced Context Manager processes the files  
   - **THEN** the system must intelligently truncate or summarize lower-priority files while preserving the most relevant content.

## **Feature: AI Provider Integration**

### **Acceptance Criteria: Multi-Provider Support**
1. **Interactive Provider Selection Menu**  
   - **GIVEN** the user invokes the CLI command `requirements-gathering-agent --select-provider`  
   - **WHEN** the system displays the menu  
   - **THEN** the user must be able to choose from OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama, with real-time availability detection and provider-specific setup guidance.

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**  
   - **GIVEN** a selected AI provider fails during document generation  
   - **WHEN** the system detects the failure  
   - **THEN** it must switch to an available fallback provider and retry the operation automatically.

3. **Configuration Validation**  
   - **GIVEN** a user selects a provider via the interactive menu  
   - **WHEN** the `.env` file is generated  
   - **THEN** the system must validate the configuration and notify the user of any missing or invalid credentials.

## **Feature: CLI Interface**

### **Acceptance Criteria: Command Execution**
1. **Core Document Generation**  
   - **GIVEN** the CLI is installed and configured  
   - **WHEN** the user runs `requirements-gathering-agent --core-only`  
   - **THEN** the system must generate only the core PMBOK documents and place them in the appropriate directories.

2. **Quiet Mode**  
   - **GIVEN** the user runs the tool with the `--quiet` flag enabled  
   - **WHEN** the system executes the command  
   - **THEN** progress messages must be suppressed, and only critical errors or warnings must be displayed.

---

## **Feature: Validation and Quality Assurance**

### **Acceptance Criteria: Document Validation**
1. **Schema Validation**  
   - **GIVEN** the system generates a document in JSON format  
   - **WHEN** schema validation is performed  
   - **THEN** the document must pass the validation with no structural errors, ensuring compatibility with third-party tools.

2. **Error Handling**  
   - **GIVEN** the system encounters an invalid document structure during validation  
   - **WHEN** the user runs `requirements-gathering-agent --validate-only`  
   - **THEN** the system must log the error and provide actionable recommendations for resolving the issue.
