## Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

The following acceptance criteria detail the conditions that must be met for successful project completion.  They are grouped by feature and utilize the Given-When-Then format.  Performance criteria are included where applicable, and edge cases are explicitly addressed.

**I. Core Functionality: PMBOK Document Generation**

**A. Project Charter Generation:**

* **Given** a valid project README.md file containing basic project information (title, goals, stakeholders).
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** a valid PMBOK-compliant Project Charter document (e.g., `generated-documents/project-charter/project-charter.md`) is generated, containing all mandatory sections as defined by PMBOK 7.0 and populated with data extracted from the README and other discovered files.  The document should include, but not be limited to: Project Purpose, Project Objectives, High-Level Requirements, Key Stakeholders, and Project Manager.
* **Given** a README.md file with missing or incomplete information.
* **When** the command is executed.
* **Then** the tool gracefully handles the missing data, either by prompting the user for missing information, using default values (clearly documented), or providing informative error messages indicating the missing data points and their impact on document generation.  The generated document should accurately reflect the available information.
* **Given** a large and complex README.md file with extensive project details.
* **When** the command is executed.
* **Then** the tool generates the Project Charter within a reasonable timeframe (under 60 seconds for a README under 10,000 words).  The tool should efficiently manage memory usage to prevent crashes or performance degradation.


**B. Other PMBOK Document Generation:**

* **Given** a valid project directory structure containing relevant documentation (README.md, requirements documents, etc.).
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed with options to generate specific document categories (e.g., `--management-plans`, `--planning-artifacts`, `--generate-stakeholder`).
* **Then** all requested PMBOK-compliant documents are generated in the appropriate subdirectories within `generated-documents/`, correctly formatted (Markdown by default), and populated with relevant data extracted from the project files.  Each document should be complete and adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  The tool should provide clear indication of the generated documents.
* **Given** a project with inconsistent or conflicting information across multiple source files.
* **When** the command is executed.
* **Then** the tool identifies and reports inconsistencies or conflicts, providing suggestions for resolution, but still generates the requested documents, highlighting the areas of conflict within the generated files.


**II. Enhanced Project Analysis**

**A. Source Discovery:**

* **Given** a project directory structure with files located in standard locations (README.md, requirements/, docs/, etc.) and non-standard locations.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool discovers and analyzes all relevant Markdown files (up to 3 levels deep recursively), including those in non-standard locations, accurately identifying their type (requirements, architecture, etc.) and assigning a relevance score (0-100).  The tool should explicitly list the files discovered and their relevance scores.  It should correctly identify and ignore system directories (node_modules, .git, etc.).
* **Given** a project with a very large number of files (e.g., > 1000 files).
* **When** the command is executed.
* **Then** the tool handles the large number of files efficiently, reporting progress and completing the analysis within a reasonable time (under 5 minutes for 1000 files).


**B. Relevance Scoring:**

* **Given** a set of Markdown files with varying levels of relevance to PMBOK concepts.
* **When** the tool analyzes these files.
* **Then** the relevance scores assigned accurately reflect the content's relevance, with higher scores assigned to files containing more PMBOK terminology, key phrases, and strategic placement.


**III. Enhanced Context Manager**

**A. Context Utilization:**

* **Given** a project with a variety of documentation and a specified AI model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro).
* **When** the tool generates documents.
* **Then** the Enhanced Context Manager utilizes a significant portion of the AI model's context window (at least 50% for large models like Gemini 1.5 Pro).  A detailed context report (accessible via `--context-report`) should be generated, showing token usage for each document and overall utilization.
* **Given** a project exceeding the token limit of the selected AI model.
* **When** the tool generates documents.
* **Then** the tool intelligently manages context, prioritizing the most relevant information and providing clear warnings or suggestions to the user about potential truncation.


**B. 3-Phase Context Strategy:**

* **Given** different AI models with varying token limits.
* **When** the tool generates documents.
* **Then** the tool adapts its 3-phase context strategy appropriately for each model, maximizing context utilization while avoiding token overflow.


**IV.  PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation**

* **Given** generated PMBOK documents.
* **When** the `--validate-pmbok` flag is used.
* **Then** the tool validates the documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing a detailed report (including scores and recommendations) indicating compliance level, missing elements, and areas for improvement.  The report should be clear, concise, and actionable.


**V.  Multiple AI Provider Support**

* **Given** valid API keys and configurations for Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.
* **When** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed.
* **Then** the tool successfully connects to and utilizes the specified AI provider for document generation.  The tool should provide a clear mechanism for selecting the provider (e.g., environment variables, command-line argument).  It should gracefully handle failures to connect to a provider, falling back to another configured provider or providing informative error messages.


**VI.  Error Handling and Retry Logic**

* **Given** network issues or API errors during document generation.
* **When** the `--with-retry` flag is used.
* **Then** the tool attempts to retry failed requests a specified number of times (configurable), providing detailed logs of retry attempts and failures.


**VII.  New Document Type: Project KickOff Preparations Checklist**

* **Given** the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed with the appropriate flags (e.g., `--generate-planning`).
* **When** the tool generates documents.
* **Then** a `project-kickoff-preparations-checklist.md` file is generated within the `planning-artifacts` directory, containing a detailed checklist of tasks aligned with PMBOK best practices for project initiation.


These acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive basis for testing and validating the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Further criteria may be added as needed during development to address specific aspects not covered here.
