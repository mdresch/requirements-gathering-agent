### 1. Risk Identification

This section identifies potential risks categorized by their nature.  The identification is based on the project description,  technical specifications, and potential external factors.

### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

This matrix assesses the identified risks based on probability and impact.  Probability is estimated as a percentage (High: 60-100%, Medium: 30-59%, Low: 0-29%), and Impact is rated on a scale of 1-5 (1=Low, 5=High).  Risk Score is the product of Probability and Impact.

### 3. Risk Response Planning

This section outlines mitigation strategies and contingency plans for the high-priority risks.


#### 3.1 Risk Mitigation Strategies

| Risk ID | Risk Description                                                                        | Mitigation Strategy | Contingency Plan                                                                                                 |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TR-1    | Azure OpenAI API unavailability or rate limiting                                      | Implement error handling and retry mechanisms; explore alternative AI providers. | Monitor API usage, implement rate limiting logic within the application, switch to a backup provider if necessary. |
| TR-3    | Insufficient context handling leading to inaccurate or incomplete document generation | Optimize context summarization techniques; implement context chunking and prioritization. | Manually review and edit generated documents; provide users with tools to refine context.                        |
| TR-4    | Security vulnerabilities in the application or API integrations                      | Conduct regular security audits; use secure coding practices; implement input validation. | Patch identified vulnerabilities immediately; implement security monitoring and incident response plans.             |
| BR-2    | Negative user feedback leading to low adoption rate                               | Implement thorough testing and user feedback mechanisms; prioritize bug fixes and feature enhancements. | Develop a plan to address negative feedback promptly; engage with users to improve the tool.                        |


#### 3.2 Contingency Plans (Examples)

* **TR-1 (Azure OpenAI API Outage):**  If the Azure OpenAI API is unavailable for more than 24 hours, switch to the Google AI or Ollama provider.  The contingency plan includes pre-configured settings for these alternative providers.  The Operations team will monitor the Azure OpenAI service status page and implement the switch based on predefined criteria.

* **TR-3 (Insufficient Context):** If document quality is consistently low due to insufficient context, the development team will prioritize improving the context management system by implementing more sophisticated summarization techniques and advanced context selection algorithms.  A manual review process will be implemented for critical documents.


* **BR-2 (Negative User Feedback):** A dedicated team will monitor user feedback channels (e.g., GitHub issues, support emails).  A prioritized bug-fixing and feature enhancement roadmap will address the most critical issues.  A public communication strategy will be implemented to address concerns and demonstrate responsiveness.


### 4. Risk Monitoring & Control

* **Risk Register:** A centralized risk register will track all identified risks, their assessments, mitigation strategies, and status.  The register will be updated regularly.

* **Risk Review Meetings:** Regular risk review meetings (weekly or bi-weekly) will assess the status of risks, identify new risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

* **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):**  KRIs
