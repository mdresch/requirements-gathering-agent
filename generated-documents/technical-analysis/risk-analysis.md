### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

This matrix assesses the probability and impact of each identified risk. Probability is rated as High (H), Medium (M), or Low (L), with percentage estimates. Impact is rated on a scale of 1-5 (1=Low, 5=Critical). Risk Score is the product of Probability and Impact.  Risk Priority is derived from the Risk Score.

### 3. Risk Response Planning

This section outlines mitigation strategies, contingency plans, and monitoring procedures for the identified risks.

#### 3.1 Risk Mitigation Strategies

* **TR-01 (Azure OpenAI API unavailability):**  Mitigate: Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.  Explore alternative AI providers (Google AI, Ollama) as a backup.
* **TR-02 (API incompatibility):** Mitigate:  Monitor Azure OpenAI API updates and plan for timely code adjustments.  Utilize version control and automated testing.
* **TR-03 (Inaccurate document processing):** Mitigate: Implement thorough input validation and data cleaning procedures.  Develop robust error handling for unexpected file formats.
* **TR-04 (Insufficient context):** Mitigate: Optimize context management strategies.  Implement techniques like summarization and selective context inclusion. Explore models with larger context windows.
* **TR-05 (Security vulnerabilities):** Mitigate: Use secure coding practices, conduct regular security audits, and keep dependencies updated. Implement appropriate access controls and authentication.
* **TR-06 (Unexpected errors):** Mitigate:  Implement comprehensive logging and error tracking.  Thoroughly test edge cases and unexpected input.
