## 1. Introduction

This Risk Analysis document identifies, assesses, and proposes mitigation strategies for potential risks associated with the ADPA project. ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework designed for AI-powered document generation and business analysis, integrating multiple industry frameworks (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK) and AI providers. Given its complexity, enterprise focus, and integration breadth, a thorough risk management approach is critical to ensure security, compliance, scalability, and operational stability.

| S-02    | Data leakage or exposure during AI API calls or document generation. | Critical     | Medium      | Use encrypted communication channels (TLS), secure environment variables for API keys, and local AI providers (Ollama) for sensitive data. |
| S-03    | Non-compliance with regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.). | High         | Low         | Maintain compliance via documented controls, audit logs, security reviews, and adherence to enterprise security frameworks. |
| S-04    | Vulnerabilities introduced via third-party dependencies (npm packages, AI SDKs). | High         | Medium      | Regularly scan dependencies for vulnerabilities (Snyk, Dependabot), apply patches promptly, and enforce strict dependency policies. |

### 3.3 Operational Risks
