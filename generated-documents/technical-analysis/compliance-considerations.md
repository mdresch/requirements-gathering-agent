  - Basel III: Capital adequacy, stress testing, and market liquidity risk requirements.  
  - MiFID II: Transparency, conduct of business obligations, and reporting requirements for financial instruments.  
  - FINRA, CFTC, FCA, BaFin: Regional financial regulatory compliance for trading, reporting, and risk management.  
  - SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act): Financial reporting, internal control, and audit trail requirements for publicly traded companies.  
  - PCI DSS: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard for handling credit card information.

- **Privacy and Data Protection**:  
  - GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): EU regulation on personal data processing, data subject rights, cross-border data transfers.  
  - CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act): Privacy rights for California residents (relevant if serving US customers).  
  - HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act): For healthcare-related data if any healthcare documents are processed.  
  - FedRAMP: For government cloud service compliance if hosting or integration involves US government data.

- **Information Security and Quality Standards**:  
  - ISO 27001: Information security management systems requirements.  
  - ISO 9001: Quality management system standards.  
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework (recommended for US-based deployments).  

- **Industry-Specific Compliance**:  
  - Healthcare (HIPAA) if applicable.  
  - Government (FedRAMP) if applicable.  
  - Financial Services compliance frameworks as above.  

### 1.2 Industry-Specific Compliance Requirements  
- Financial institutions require stringent audit trails, segregation of duties, and data encryption.  
- Healthcare requires strict PHI (Protected Health Information) handling controls.  
- Government entities require FedRAMP or equivalent cloud security certifications.  

### 1.3 Geographic Compliance Considerations  
- Data residency and sovereignty laws (e.g., GDPR data localization requirements, Schrems II considerations).  
- Cross-border data transfer mechanisms (Standard Contractual Clauses, Binding Corporate Rules).  
- Regional-specific privacy laws beyond GDPR/CCPA (e.g., LGPD Brazil, PIPEDA Canada).  

### 1.4 Data Protection Regulations  
- Personal data processed by ADPA’s AI providers and integrations must comply with GDPR principles of lawfulness, fairness, transparency, purpose limitation, data minimization, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity, and confidentiality.  
- AI data processing contracts and Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) must be established with AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama/local).  
- Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) should be conducted prior to deployment.

## 2. Compliance Requirements

### 2.1 Technical Compliance Specifications  
- **Authentication & Authorization**:  
  - Enterprise-grade identity management using Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).  
  - Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).

  - Secure token management (JWTs with short expiry and secure signing).  

- **Data Security**:  
  - Encryption of data at rest and in transit (TLS 1.2+ for all API and web traffic).  
  - Secure storage of secrets (API keys, tokens) using vault or managed secret stores (e.g., Azure Key Vault).  
  - Secure coding practices to prevent injection, XSS, CSRF, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.  
  - Rate limiting and abuse prevention (e.g., express-rate-limit middleware).  

- **Audit Logging & Monitoring**:  
  - Immutable audit logs for authentication, authorization, document generation, and data access events.  
  - Real-time monitoring and alerting for anomalous behavior or potential security incidents.  
  - Compliance with SOX audit trail requirements.  

- **API Compliance**:  
  - Adherence to OpenAPI 3.0 specifications with security schemes defined.  
  - Secure OAuth2 flows for API clients and integrations.  

- **AI Provider Integration Security**:  
  - Encrypted channels for AI provider API interactions.  
  - Managed identities or OAuth2 authentication for Azure OpenAI and other AI providers.  
  - Failover mechanisms to prevent overexposure or abuse of AI usage limits.  

### 2.2 Operational Compliance Procedures  
- **User Access Management**:  
  - Periodic review of user access rights and roles.  
  - Onboarding/offboarding procedures integrated with enterprise identity management.  

- **Incident Response**:  
  - Defined incident response plan aligned with ISO 27001 and NIST standards.  
  - Procedures for breach notification consistent with GDPR (72-hour notification) and other applicable laws.  

- **Change Management**:  
  - Controlled deployment pipeline with code reviews and automated testing (CI/CD).  
  - Documentation of changes impacting compliance posture.  

- **Data Retention & Deletion**:  
  - Data lifecycle management policies aligned with DMBOK 2.0 guidance.  
  - Data minimization and purpose limitation enforced in workflows.  

### 2.3 Documentation and Audit Requirements  
- Maintain comprehensive documentation of:  
  - Compliance policies and procedures.  
  - Configuration and environment setup (including AI provider keys and secrets).  
  - Access control policies and role definitions.  
  - Audit logs and monitoring reports.  
  - Data protection impact assessments (DPIA) and privacy notices.  

- Enable audit capabilities for external audits (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001 certification audits).  
- Document AI decision-making processes where applicable (transparency and explainability).  

### 2.4 Privacy and Security Mandates  
- Data anonymization or pseudonymization where applicable before AI processing.  
- Consent management if personal data from end-users is processed.  
- Secure integration with document management systems (SharePoint, Confluence) ensuring access control and data protection.  
- Compliance with PCI DSS for any payment card data processed or stored.

## 3. Risk Assessment

### 3.1 Compliance Risk Identification  
- Unauthorized access to sensitive documents or data.  
- Data breaches due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities.  
- Non-compliance with GDPR/CCPA leading to fines and reputational damage.  
- AI provider misuse or data leakage risks.  
- Inaccurate or incomplete audit logs compromising forensic investigations.  
- Failure to meet financial regulations impacting client contracts.  

### 3.2 Impact Assessment of Non-Compliance  
- Financial penalties (e.g., GDPR fines up to €20 million or 4% global turnover).

- Provider-specific tests for AI service authentication and failover behavior (`test:azure`, `test:github`, `test:ollama`).  
- Performance and load testing to ensure secure scaling under load.  
- Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments before production deployment.  
- Regular review and update of test cases to cover new compliance requirements.  

### 4.3 Training and Awareness Programs  
- Role-specific training for developers, administrators, and end-users on security and compliance obligations.  
- Training on secure handling of AI provider credentials and secrets.  
- Awareness on privacy principles and data handling best practices.  
- Incident response drills and tabletop exercises.  

### 4.4 Ongoing Compliance Maintenance
