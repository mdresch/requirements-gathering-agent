**Audit & Logging:**
- Immutable audit logs (winston, express-winston).
- Log user actions, access, and system events for regulatory auditability.
- Retain logs per industry requirements (e.g., 7 years for SOX/financial).

**Privacy Controls:**
- Data minimization: Only collect/process data needed for core functionality.
- Redaction and pseudonymization/anonymization for test or analytics data.
- Consent management for AI integrations and document processing.

**API Security:**
- Input validation (express-validator, joi, zod).
- Rate limiting (express-rate-limit) to prevent abuse.
- Secure CORS configuration and security headers (helmet).

**Third-Party & Integration Security:**
- Vendor risk assessment for AI, Adobe, Microsoft, Atlassian integrations.
- Secure OAuth2 flows for Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe APIs.
- Data processing agreements with providers handling regulated data.

### 2.2 Operational Compliance Procedures

- **Data Subject Rights:** Mechanisms for data access, correction, deletion, and export.
- **Incident Response:** Documented procedures for data breach notification and escalation.
- **Change Management:** Version control (GitHub, GitLab), release approvals, rollback plans.
- **Vendor Management:** Due diligence and contract review for integrated services.
- **Monitoring:** Continuous system health and security monitoring (morgan, built-in metrics).

### 2.3 Documentation & Audit Requirements

- Maintain up-to-date Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) and BAAs (if handling PHI).
- Maintain system design, data flow, and risk assessment documentation.
- Document all compliance-relevant processes and controls (privacy, security, audit).
- Retain records for compliance checks and external audits.

### 2.4 Privacy and Security Mandates

- **Privacy by Design:** Embed privacy features (consent, access controls) in all workflows.
- **Security by Default:** Secure settings enabled by default; opt-in for less secure features.
- **Data Lifecycle Management:** Policies for retention, archival, and secure deletion.
- **User Awareness:** Clear privacy policies, terms of use, and user guidance.

## 3. Risk Assessment

### 3.1 Compliance Risk Identification

- **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive or personal data.
- **Non-Compliance:** Failure to meet GDPR, CCPA, SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, or other applicable requirements.
- **Insecure Integrations:** Data leakage or compromise via third-party services (AI providers, SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe).
- **Insufficient Auditability:** Inability to produce regulatory audit trails.
- **Misconfiguration:** Exposure due to insecure default settings or environment leaks.

### 3.2 Impact Assessment of Non-Compliance

- **Regulatory Penalties:** Fines up to €20M or 4% of global turnover (GDPR); heavy CCPA, SOX, HIPAA penalties.
- **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust, client churn.
- **Operational Disruption:** Suspension of service, legal injunctions.
- **Financial Loss:** Regulatory fines, class action lawsuits, contractual penalties.

### 3.3 Mitigation Strategies and Controls

- **Technical:**
    - End-to-end encryption and strict API security.
    - Automated vulnerability and dependency scanning (npm audit, Snyk).
    - Secure CI/CD pipeline with code review and approval gates.
- **Organizational:**
    - Appoint Data Protection Officer (DPO) if required.
    - Regular privacy and security training for staff.
    - Vendor due diligence and contract review.
- **Procedural:**
    - Data breach response plan and regular incident drills.
    - Regular internal/external audits and penetration testing.
    - Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for new features.

### 3.4 Monitoring and Reporting Requirements

- **Continuous Monitoring:** System health, access logs, anomaly detection.
- **Automated Alerts:** For suspicious activities, access violations, or system errors.
- **Periodic Reviews:** Regular compliance reviews and evidence collection.
- **Regulatory Reporting:** Mechanisms for breach notification and regulatory filings.

## 4. Implementation Guidelines

### 4.1 Compliance Integration Strategies

- **Shift Left Compliance:** Integrate compliance checks early in development (CI/CD).
- **Privacy/Security by Design:** Architect modules (AI, document generation, integrations) with compliance in mind.
- **Configurable Data Handling:** Allow per-tenant/regional data handling and retention settings.
- **Template Compliance:** Ensure document templates reflect regulatory requirements (audit fields, approval history, etc.).

### 4.2 Testing and Validation Procedures

- **Automated Testing:**
    - Unit, integration, and security tests (Jest, ts-jest).
    - Test data anonymization and coverage for compliance scenarios.
- **Privacy/Security Validation:**
    - Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, dependency checks.
    - Data masking and redaction in test environments.
- **User Acceptance Testing:**
    - Verify privacy controls, data subject right workflows, consent flows.

### 4.3 Training and Awareness Programs

- **Developer Training:** Secure coding, privacy principles, regulatory landscape.
- **User Training:** Usage policies, privacy rights, incident reporting.
- **Third-Party Training:** Integration partners briefed on compliance expectations.

### 4.4 Ongoing Compliance Maintenance

- **Policy Reviews:** Regularly update privacy, security, and compliance policies.
- **Regulatory Tracking:** Monitor for changes in applicable law (e.g., new state privacy acts, global regulations).
- **Vendor Management:** Reassess third-party compliance posture regularly.
- **Documentation:** Maintain living documentation in the repository (compliance.md, data-flow.md, etc.).
