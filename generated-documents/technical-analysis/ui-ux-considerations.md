### b. User Journey Mapping & Flow Analysis

**Key Flows:**
1. **Onboarding & Setup**
   - Install (NPM/Docker), configure environment (.env), initialize integrations.
   - First-run wizard or guided setup in the admin portal.

2. **Document Generation**
   - Select framework (BABOK/PMBOK/DMBOK), choose template, input parameters, trigger generation, review output, publish (Confluence/SharePoint/Adobe).

3. **Integration Management**
   - Authenticate and configure Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe, and AI providers.
   - Monitor integration health/status.

4. **Workflow Automation**
   - Set up or trigger multi-step pipelines for automated document creation and publishing.

5. **Administration & Monitoring**
   - Manage users, roles, API keys, and view analytics (usage, error logs, compliance status).

6. **Feedback/Support**
   - Access documentation, submit issues, or contact support.

**UX Considerations:**
- Minimize cognitive load at each step; provide progress indicators for longer operations.
- Allow users to save and resume in-progress tasks.
- Ensure error states and required actions are clear and actionable.

- **Undo/Redo:** Allow users to revert actions (e.g., document deletion, workflow changes).
- **Shortcuts:** Offer power-user features (bulk actions, keyboard shortcuts, CLI flags).
- **Guided Actions:** Wizards for complex flows (integration setup, multi-step document pipelines).
- **Error Prevention:** Validate inputs before submission and provide clear, actionable error messages.

---

## 2. User Interface Guidelines

### a. Visual Design Principles & Standards

- **Branding:** Support custom enterprise branding (logos, color palettes, typography) in both web portal and generated outputs.
- **Clarity:** Use high-contrast, legible fonts and a clean, modern design (leveraging Tailwind CSS).
- **Hierarchy:** Employ visual hierarchy for primary actions, warnings, and navigation.
- **Data Visualization:** Utilize clear, standards-compliant charts for analytics and reporting.
- **Dark/Light Modes:** Provide theme switcher for accessibility and user preference.

---

### b. Component Library Recommendations

- **Web Portal:**  
  - Use a robust React component library (e.g., [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/)), extended with Tailwind CSS for custom branding.
  - Data tables, modals, wizards, notifications, and robust form components (with validation).
  - Integration status indicators, log viewers, and code/markdown viewers.

- **CLI UX:**  
  - Use libraries like [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) for interactive CLI UIs, enabling menus, progress bars, and colored output.

- **API Docs:**  
  - Swagger UI or Redoc for interactive, accessible documentation.

---

### c. Accessibility Compliance Requirements

- **WCAG 2.1 AA** at minimum:
  - Sufficient color contrast ratios (all themes).
  - Keyboard navigability throughout; visible focus states.
  - ARIA roles and labels for all interactive elements.
  - Screen reader compatibility (labels, announcements for dynamic content).
  - Alt text for all icons/images.
  - Accessible error handling (announce errors, suggest corrections).
- **Generated Outputs:** Ensure exported PDFs/Docs meet PDF/UA standards for accessibility where possible.

---

### d. Responsive Design Considerations

- **Web Portal:**  
  - Fully responsive layouts (desktop, tablet, mobile), with adaptive navigation (collapsible sidebars, hamburger menus).
  - Prioritize mobile support for dashboards, notifications, and basic workflow monitoring.
  - Touch-friendly controls and input fields.

- **CLI/Terminal:**  
  - Ensure output is readable in various terminal sizes.
  - Support for terminals with limited color or Unicode support.

---

## 3. Usability Framework

### a. Usability Testing Strategies

- **Heuristic Evaluations:** Regular expert reviews against usability heuristics.
- **Task-based Testing:** Conduct user testing with real-world enterprise scenarios (e.g., generating a PMBOK-compliant project charter, setting up Confluence integration).
- **Remote Testing:** Support for remote observation with screen sharing or session recording.
- **Inclusive Testing:** Include users with assistive technologies (screen readers, keyboard-only).

---

### b. Performance & Accessibility Metrics

- **Performance:**
  - Time to complete core tasks (document generation, integration setup).
  - Latency for API and UI interactions.
  - CLI command execution times and error rates.

- **Accessibility:**
  - Automated scans (axe, Lighthouse) and manual screen reader/keyboard checks.
  - PDF accessibility checks (tag structure, alt text, navigation).

- **Error Rates:** Track failed document generations, integration errors, and user-reported issues.

---

### c. User Feedback Collection Methods
