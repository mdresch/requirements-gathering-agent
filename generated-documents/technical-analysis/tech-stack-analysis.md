## 2. Stack Recommendations

### 2.1 Frontend Technology Recommendations

| Tech             | Reasoning                                                       |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Next.js 14**   | SSR, SSG, React 18, API routes. Modern enterprise standard.     |
| **React 18**     | Rich UI, hooks, concurrent features.                            |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Utility-first, scalable, easily themed for enterprise branding. |
| **TypeScript**   | Type safety, maintainability, shared code with backend.         |

**Alternatives:**  
- *Angular* (if heavy forms/workflow, but current stack is React-centric)
- *Chakra UI/MUI* (if richer component libraries needed)

### 2.2 Backend Framework Suggestions

| Tech                | Reasoning                                                                                     |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Node.js (LTS)**   | High concurrency, non-blocking, mature ecosystem, required for AI/CLI integration.            |
| **TypeScript**      | Enterprise maintainability, type safety, shared types across stack.                           |
| **Express.js**      | Lightweight, battle-tested, rich middleware (security, logging, rate limiting).               |
| **TypeSpec**        | API-first, generates OpenAPI, ensures contract-first development and partner integration.      |

**Enhancements:**
- *NestJS* (for larger teams, opinionated structure, modularity, decorators, built-in DI)
- *tRPC* (for typesafe end-to-end, if OpenAPI spec is less critical)

### 2.3 Database Technology Selection

**Short-Term (Current):**  
- JSON-based configuration (simple, file-based, sufficient for PoC/dev)

**Recommended for Enterprise/Scalability:**

| Tech            | Reasoning                                                                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **PostgreSQL**  | ACID, relational, great for complex querying, RBAC, extensibility, JSONB support.             |
| **MongoDB**     | NoSQL, flexible schemas, rapid prototyping, document-centric (for templates, logs, etc).      |
| **Redis**       | Caching, job queues (BullMQ), ephemeral/session data, rate limiting.                          |

- **Choice:**  
  - *PostgreSQL* for transactional/business data, user management, audit logs  
  - *MongoDB* for flexible document storage (templates, AI results)  
  - *Redis* for caching, queueing, session management

**Migration Guidance:**  
- Start with JSON/db-migrate scripts, move to hybrid (PostgreSQL + Redis) as scale grows

### 2.4 Infrastructure and Deployment Options

**Containerization:**  
- **Docker:** For reproducible builds, dev/prod parity, local and CI/CD consistency

**Orchestration (as you scale):**  
- **Kubernetes:** For microservices, scaling, HA, rolling updates (AKS/EKS/GKE)

**Cloud Providers:**  
- **Azure:** (API Center, AD integration, SharePoint, enterprise focus)
- **AWS/GCP:** If multi-cloud/neutrality desired

**CI/CD:**  
- **GitHub Actions** (current norm), **Azure DevOps Pipelines** for enterprise

**API Gateway/Security:**  
- **Azure API Management** (enterprise, throttling, security, integration)
- **NGINX/Traefik** for load balancing in non-Azure contexts

**Monitoring/Logging:**  
- **Prometheus/Grafana, Azure Monitor, ELK Stack** for logs/metrics
- **Winston** (already used) for app-level logs

## 4. Implementation Roadmap

### 4.1 Technology Adoption Strategy

**Phase 1: Foundation (Current / Short-Term)**
- Continue Node.js/TypeScript/Express/Next.js/Tailwind stack
- Use JSON/config-based storage for rapid prototyping
- Integrate with AI providers and third-party APIs as modules
- Adopt TypeSpec for API-first governance

**Phase 2: Enterprise Readiness**
- Move to PostgreSQL (primary) + Redis (caching/jobs); optionally MongoDB for flexible documents
- Containerize with Docker; provide official images and docker-compose templates
- Harden security (OAuth2, AD integration, rate limiting, audit logging)
- Implement robust CI/CD (GitHub Actions now, Azure DevOps for enterprise)
- Expand test coverage, performance/load testing

**Phase 3: Scale and Optimize**
- Kubernetes deployment for HA/scalability
- Cloud-managed DBs and Redis for reliability
- Set up monitoring (Prometheus/Azure Monitor), centralized logging (ELK/Winston/Azure)
- API Gateway (Azure API Management) for throttling/security
- Roll out advanced features (collaboration, workflow automation, analytics dashboard)
- Deepen enterprise integrations (SSO, VCS, ServiceNow, Jira, etc.)

### 4.2 Migration Considerations

- **Config to DB:** Write migration scripts to move JSON configs to PostgreSQL/MongoDB collections
- **Statefulness:** Audit code for stateful logic, enforce stateless APIs for cloud scaling
- **Auth:** Plan for migration to enterprise SSO (OAuth2/SAML/AD)
- **Legacy CLI:** Ensure CLI commands work with new APIs/db

### 4.3 Risk Mitigation Approaches

- **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain old API versions during migration (versioned endpoints)
- **Feature Flags:** Use toggles for new features (DB-backed storage, new integrations)
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests for all major flows
- **Security Audits:** Regular review, penetration testing, dependency scanning (Snyk/Dependabot)
- **Documentation:** Keep API/CLI/Web docs up to date for all stakeholders

### 4.4 Performance Optimization Guidelines

- **API Caching:** Use Redis for frequently accessed routes (templates, frameworks, auth tokens)
- **Async Job Processing:** Offload heavy document generation to background jobs (BullMQ/Redis)
- **Database Indexing:** Tune indices on frequently queried DB fields
- **Connection Pooling:** For DB and AI provider APIs
- **Load Testing:** Regularly test endpoints with tools like k6, Artillery
- **Resource Monitoring:** Track CPU/mem usage, autoscale containers as needed
