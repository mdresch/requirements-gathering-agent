- **Key Advantages**:
  - ACID compliance ensures data integrity.
  - Strong support for JSON and JSONB fields.
  - Advanced indexing and full-text search capabilities.
  - Community-driven extensions (e.g., `pgcrypto` for encryption).
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Slightly higher learning curve compared to MySQL.
- **Implementation Considerations**:
  - Use connection pooling (e.g., `pg-pool`) for optimized database performance.
  - Set up daily backups and disaster recovery strategies using tools like `pg_dump`.
- **Considered Alternatives**:
  - **MongoDB**: Suitable for unstructured data but lacks transactional guarantees.
  - **MySQL**: Easier to set up but lacks advanced JSON handling.
