## 2. Stack Recommendations

### 2.1 Frontend Technology Recommendations  
- **Next.js 14 + React 18:**  
  Mature, performant React framework with server-side rendering, static site generation, and incremental static regeneration, ideal for admin portals requiring SEO and fast load times.  
- **Tailwind CSS:**  
  Utility-first CSS framework offering rapid UI development and maintainability with theming and responsive design out of the box.  
- **TypeScript:**  
  Ensures type safety, reduces runtime errors, and improves developer productivity in frontend code.  
- **Jest + React Testing Library:**  
  For comprehensive unit and integration testing of UI components to maintain code quality.  

### 2.2 Backend Framework Suggestions  
- **Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.7+:**  
  Latest stable Node.js LTS version provides improved performance and security; TypeScript ensures maintainability and scalability.  
- **Express.js:**  
  Lightweight, flexible web framework with middleware ecosystem; well-suited for building REST APIs with TypeSpec-generated OpenAPI specs.  
- **TypeSpec (formerly known as Cadl):**  
  For API-first design, generating server stubs, clients, and OpenAPI documentation, improving API consistency and automation.  
- **AI Provider SDKs:**  
  Use official SDKs and REST clients for Google AI, Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, and local Ollama API for robust AI integration.  
- **Redis:**  
  For caching AI context, rate limiting, session management, and performance optimization.  
- **MongoDB (via Mongoose):**  
  Recommended for document-oriented storage of configuration, templates, user data, and analytics; flexible schema suits evolving automation needs.  

### 2.3 Database Technology Selection  
- **Primary:** MongoDB for flexible, schema-less document storage that aligns with document generation and configuration data.  
- **Secondary (Optional):** Consider PostgreSQL or another relational DB if transactional or relational data management becomes critical.  
- **Caching:** Redis for in-memory caching to improve throughput and reduce latency for frequent operations.  

### 2.4 Infrastructure and Deployment Options  
- **Containerization:** Docker for packaging all components ensures consistency across environments.  
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes for scalable, resilient deployments with support for microservices architecture.  
- **Cloud Providers:** Azure preferred for synergy with Azure OpenAI and Microsoft Entra ID integration; also supports multi-cloud AI providers.  
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments; consider adding Canary deployments and Blue/Green strategies.  
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Use Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack or Azure Monitor for metrics, logs, and health checks.  
- **Security:** Implement network policies, secrets management (Azure Key Vault or HashiCorp Vault), TLS encryption, and hardened container images.
