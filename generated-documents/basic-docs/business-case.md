## 1. Executive Summary

This business case proposes investment in the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), a revolutionary AI-powered system automating project documentation generation.  Currently, our project teams expend significant time and resources on manual documentation, leading to inefficiencies and delays.  The RGA addresses this by generating PMBOK-compliant documents (project charters, stakeholder registers, etc.) automatically, significantly reducing documentation time.  While initial development costs are estimated at $50,000, the projected annual savings of $100,000 in labor costs and a 20% increase in project delivery speed yield a strong ROI within the first year. We strongly recommend proceeding with this project to enhance project management efficiency and accelerate time-to-market.

## 2. Problem Definition & Business Need

Manual project documentation consumes a significant portion of project team resources.  Based on internal surveys, we estimate teams spend an average of 10 hours per week on documentation tasks. With 20 active project teams, this equates to a loss of 200 hours weekly, or approximately $26,000 per month in labor costs ($312,000 annually) at an average hourly rate of $130.  Furthermore, these delays impact project timelines, potentially leading to missed market opportunities and reduced revenue.  Addressing this inefficiency is critical for improving operational efficiency and maintaining our competitive edge.

## 3. Proposed Solution

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) is an AI-powered solution designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  It uses advanced AI models and a template-based system to produce high-quality documents from input data, significantly reducing manual effort. The RGA supports multiple AI providers for flexibility and redundancy.  The system features a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use and integration with existing project management workflows.  The system's output is validated JSON, ensuring interoperability with various systems.

## 4. Strategic Alignment

Investing in RGA directly supports our strategic goals of enhancing operational efficiency and accelerating time-to-market.  By streamlining the documentation process, RGA frees up valuable project team time, allowing them to focus on higher-value tasks.  The speed increase in project delivery will enable us to respond more quickly to market changes and capitalize on emerging opportunities. This aligns perfectly with our company's focus on innovation and customer-centricity.

## 5. Financial Analysis

*   **Estimated Costs:**
    *   **One-Time Costs:** $50,000 (Development, including testing and deployment)
    *   **Recurring Costs:** $5,000 annually (AI API subscriptions and maintenance)
*   **Projected Benefits:**
    *   **Quantitative:** $100,000 annual savings in labor costs (based on 200 hours/week reduction across 20 teams), 20% increase in project delivery speed (conservatively estimated to yield a 10% increase in project revenue).
    *   **Qualitative:** Improved team morale, reduced project risk due to improved documentation, enhanced compliance.
*   **Return on Investment (ROI) Projection:** Based on the $100,000 annual savings, the initial investment of $50,000 will be recouped within six months. Considering the additional revenue generated from faster project delivery, the ROI is projected to be significantly higher.  This calculation assumes a conservative estimate of project revenue increase based on faster project delivery.
