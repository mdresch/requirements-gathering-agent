## 1. Executive Summary
This business case proposes a project to streamline our document creation and approval process, addressing significant inefficiencies currently costing the company an estimated $500,000 annually in lost productivity.  The proposed solution involves implementing a centralized, automated document management system with integrated workflow capabilities.  This system will reduce document processing time by 50%, resulting in annual cost savings of $250,000 and increased revenue generation of $100,000 through faster contract turnaround.  The total project cost is estimated at $150,000, yielding a projected ROI of 233% within the first year. We strongly recommend approval of this project.

## 2. Clear Objectives
* Reduce document processing time by 50% within six months of implementation.
* Achieve a 75% user adoption rate within three months of launch.
* Generate $100,000 in additional revenue annually through improved efficiency.
* Reduce annual document-related costs by $250,000.
* Achieve a positive ROI within 12 months.

## 3. Risk Assessment
This section details potential risks and mitigation strategies.  Detailed risk assessment and mitigation plans will be provided in a separate document upon project approval.
---
## 4. Stakeholder Analysis
Key stakeholders include legal, finance, marketing, and operations departments.  Their interests align with improved efficiency and reduced costs.  Engagement strategies involve departmental presentations and training sessions.  A detailed stakeholder register will be included in the full project plan.
---
## 5. Approval Process
This business case requires approval from the CFO and CEO.  Following approval, project initiation will commence.
---
## 6. Problem Definition & Business Need
Current document creation and approval processes are manual, fragmented, and inefficient.  Employees spend an average of 10 hours per week on tasks related to document creation, review, and approval.  This translates to an estimated $500,000 annual loss in productivity across the organization.  Delays in contract processing also lead to lost revenue opportunities. Addressing these inefficiencies is critical for improving operational efficiency and competitiveness.
---
## 7. Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is the implementation of a new, cloud-based document management system with integrated workflow automation.  This system will centralize all document creation, review, and approval processes, automating routing and notifications.  It will be accessible to all relevant personnel, improving collaboration and transparency.
---
## 8. Strategic Alignment
This project directly supports the company's strategic goals of enhancing operational efficiency and improving customer responsiveness.  Faster contract processing will improve customer satisfaction and strengthen our competitive position.

## 9. Financial Analysis
**Estimated Costs:**
* **One-Time Costs:** Software license ($50,000), implementation services ($75,000), training ($25,000)
* **Recurring Costs:** Annual software maintenance ($5,000), IT support ($5,000)
**Projected Benefits:**
* **Quantitative:** $250,000 annual cost savings from reduced labor costs, $100,000 annual revenue increase from faster contract processing.
