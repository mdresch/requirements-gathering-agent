# User Personas: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines user personas for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, a revolutionary enterprise business analysis automation platform.  These personas represent key user groups and their interactions with the system.

**Persona 1: The Enterprise Architect (EA)**

* **Name:**  Alexandra Petrova
* **Title:** Enterprise Architect, GlobalBank
* **Goals:**  Improve efficiency and consistency of requirements gathering across large, complex projects; ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX); reduce risk and cost overruns.
* **Frustrations:**  Manual requirements gathering is time-consuming, prone to errors, and inconsistent; integrating disparate systems and data sources is challenging; lack of real-time visibility into project progress.
* **Technology Proficiency:** High. Comfortable with APIs, CLI tools, and complex software systems.
* **ADPA Usage:** Alexandra uses the ADPA API to integrate requirements gathering into GlobalBank's existing architecture. She leverages the API's capabilities to create custom templates for different project types and regulatory contexts. She monitors job progress through the API and integrates the generated outputs into the company's project management system.  She values the platform's ability to generate auditable reports demonstrating compliance.
* **Quote:**  "The ADPA API is a game-changer. It allows us to standardize our requirements gathering process, integrate it seamlessly into our existing systems, and ensure complete regulatory complianceâ€”all while dramatically reducing time and costs."


**Persona 2: The Business Analyst (BA)**

* **Name:** David Chen
* **Title:** Senior Business Analyst, Fintech Startup
* **Goals:**  Quickly elicit and document requirements from stakeholders; create clear and concise user stories; ensure stakeholder alignment; deliver high-quality documentation.
* **Frustrations:**  Juggling multiple stakeholders with conflicting priorities; difficulty translating vague requirements into concrete specifications; time pressure to deliver results.
* **Technology Proficiency:** Medium. Comfortable with basic software tools but may require some training on more advanced features.
* **ADPA Usage:** David uses the ADPA API through a user-friendly interface (potentially a web portal or GUI, not explicitly defined in the project context but a likely future enhancement) to generate initial requirements documentation. He values the speed and accuracy of the system, allowing him to focus on stakeholder collaboration and refinement.  He may use pre-built templates or create custom ones for specific projects.
* **Quote:** "The ADPA tool makes my job so much easier.  I can get a solid first draft of requirements in minutes, allowing me to spend more time collaborating with stakeholders and refining the details."


**Persona 3: The Project Manager (PM)**

* **Name:** Maria Rodriguez
* **Title:** Project Manager, GlobalBank
* **Goals:**  Maintain project scope and schedule; manage risks and issues; ensure timely delivery of project deliverables; track progress and report on key performance indicators (KPIs).
* **Frustrations:**  Inconsistent requirements documentation leads to scope creep and delays; difficulty in tracking progress across multiple teams; challenges in communicating project status to stakeholders.
* **Technology Proficiency:** Medium. Proficient in project management software but may require assistance with API integration.
* **ADPA Usage:** Maria uses the ADPA API indirectly, benefiting from the improved requirements documentation generated by the BAs. She uses the generated documents (potentially imported into her project management software) to monitor progress, manage risks, and report on KPIs. She values the platform's ability to generate PMBOK-compliant documents, ensuring consistency and compliance.
* **Quote:** "The improved quality and consistency of requirements documentation, thanks to ADPA, has significantly reduced scope creep and project delays.  It's made my job of managing the project much smoother."


**Persona 4: The Developer (Dev)**

* **Name:**  John Smith
* **Title:** Senior Software Engineer, ADPA Development Team
* **Goals:**  Maintain and enhance the ADPA platform; ensure system stability, scalability, and security; integrate new AI providers and features.
* **Frustrations:**  Dealing with inconsistent input data; debugging complex systems; ensuring API security and performance.
* **Technology Proficiency:** High. Expert in Node.js, TypeScript, and API development.
* **ADPA Usage:** John is involved in the development, testing, and maintenance of the ADPA platform. He uses the API extensively for testing, debugging, and integration with other systems. He values the platform's robust architecture and comprehensive documentation.
* **Quote:** "The TypeSpec-driven architecture and comprehensive testing suite have made developing and maintaining the ADPA platform a much more efficient and enjoyable experience."
