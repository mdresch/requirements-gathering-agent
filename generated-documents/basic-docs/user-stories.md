# User Stories for Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

## Project Overview

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) is a revolutionary AI-powered system designed to automate the creation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  It leverages multiple AI providers, offering flexibility and robustness, and aims to significantly improve efficiency in project management.  The system prioritizes ease of use through a CLI interface and supports a modular architecture for future extensibility.  This document outlines user stories for the core functionality of the RGA.


## Epic: Core Document Generation

This epic covers the primary functionality of generating various PMBOK-compliant documents.

* **US001:** As a project manager, I want to generate a project charter automatically from a concise input describing the project scope, objectives, and stakeholders, so that I can quickly initiate project documentation.  *Acceptance Criteria:*  The generated charter includes all mandatory PMBOK elements, accurately reflects the input data, and is formatted correctly as a JSON object.  *Priority:* High

* **US002:** As a project manager, I want to generate a stakeholder register automatically from provided stakeholder information, including roles, responsibilities, and communication preferences, so that I have a comprehensive overview of project stakeholders. *Acceptance Criteria:* The generated register includes all relevant stakeholder information, is correctly formatted as a JSON object, and adheres to PMBOK standards. *Priority:* High

* **US003:** As a project manager, I want to generate a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) based on a high-level project description, so that I can plan project tasks effectively. *Acceptance Criteria:* The generated WBS is a valid hierarchical structure, accurately reflects the project scope, and is output as a well-formatted JSON object.  *Priority:* High

* **US004:** As a project manager, I want to generate a Risk Management Plan automatically based on provided project information and identified risks, so that I can proactively manage potential project issues. *Acceptance Criteria:* The generated plan includes risk identification, analysis, response planning, and monitoring strategies, all adhering to PMBOK standards and formatted as a JSON object.  *Priority:* High

* **US005:** As a project manager, I want to generate compliance documentation based on specified regulatory requirements and project context, so that I can ensure adherence to legal and industry standards. *Acceptance Criteria:*  The generated documentation accurately reflects specified compliance requirements, is in a standard JSON format, and is easily auditable. *Priority:* High (due to legal implications)

* **US006:** As a project manager, I want the system to provide feedback on the completeness and validity of my input data before generating documents, so that I can correct errors and ensure the quality of the generated documents. *Acceptance Criteria:*  The system provides clear error messages and guidance for incomplete or invalid input fields.  *Priority:* High


## Epic: AI Provider Management

This epic covers the management and selection of different AI providers.

* **US007:** As a user, I want to select my preferred AI provider (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) from a list, so that I can leverage the strengths of different AI models. *Acceptance Criteria:*  A clear and intuitive interface (CLI) allows the selection of a provider; the system correctly uses the chosen provider's API. *Priority:* Medium

* **US008:** As a user, I want the system to automatically fall back to a secondary provider if my primary choice is unavailable, so that I can maintain uninterrupted functionality.  *Acceptance Criteria:*  The system detects provider failures and seamlessly switches to a predefined alternative.  *Priority:* Medium

* **US009:** As a system administrator, I want to easily configure API keys and access tokens for different AI providers, so that I can manage access and costs effectively.  *Acceptance Criteria:*  A secure configuration mechanism (e.g., environment variables) allows for easy management of provider credentials.  *Priority:* Low (Administrative task)


## Epic: Output and User Experience

This epic covers the output format and user interaction.

* **US010:** As a user, I want the generated documents to be output in a standardized JSON format, so that I can easily integrate them with other systems and tools. *Acceptance Criteria:*  All generated documents conform to a predefined JSON schema.  *Priority:* High

* **US011:** As a user, I want a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the system, so that I can easily manage configurations and trigger document generation. *Acceptance Criteria:* The CLI provides intuitive commands for all major functionalities. *Priority:* High

* **US012:** As a user, I want detailed logging and error reporting, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively. *Acceptance Criteria:*  Comprehensive logs capture all system events, including errors and warnings, with clear descriptions.  *Priority:* Medium



## Epic:  Future Enhancements (Medium/Low Priority)

* **US013:** As a user, I want the ability to customize document templates, so that I can adapt the output to my specific needs. *Priority:* Medium

* **US014:** As a user, I want to integrate the RGA with my existing project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana), so that I can streamline my workflow. *Priority:* Low

* **US015:** As a user, I want comprehensive documentation and tutorials to effectively use the RGA, so that I can quickly learn and utilize its features. *Priority:* Low


This user story document provides a comprehensive starting point for development.  Further refinement and expansion will be necessary as the project progresses.  The priority levels reflect the importance of each user story for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
