# User Stories: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

## Project Overview

ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered documentation assistant that generates comprehensive project management documentation following PMBOK standards.  It goes beyond simple document generation by incorporating Evaluative Contextual Synthesis and Hierarchical Authority Recognition, resulting in high-quality, contextually-aware documents.  ADPA integrates with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and offers a robust CLI for user interaction.


## Epic 1:  Document Generation & Management

This epic covers the core functionality of generating various document types and managing the generated output.

**Theme:** PMBOK Document Generation

* **US001:** As a project manager, I want to generate a complete set of PMBOK-compliant project documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, etc.) from a project's README file and other relevant documentation, so that I can quickly initiate and manage my project effectively.
* **US002:** As a technical lead, I want to generate comprehensive technical design documents (architecture design, system design, API documentation, etc.), so that I can create detailed and accurate technical specifications for my project.
* **US003:** As a business analyst, I want to generate executive-ready strategic documents (purpose statement, company values), so that I can communicate the project's value proposition clearly to stakeholders.
* **US004:** As a user, I want to specify the output format (Markdown, JSON, YAML) for the generated documents, so that I can integrate the output seamlessly with my existing workflows.
* **US005:** As a user, I want the ability to generate only specific document types (e.g., only stakeholder documents, only planning artifacts), so that I can focus on the aspects of the project that require immediate attention.
* **US006:** As a user, I want to specify a custom output directory for the generated documents, so that I can organize my project files effectively.
* **US007:** As a project manager, I want the system to automatically version control all generated documents using Git, so that I can track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.
* **US008:** As a user, I want the system to provide detailed quality scores and recommendations for each generated document, so that I can assess their completeness and accuracy.
* **US009:** As a user, I want the system to perform PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation on the generated documents, providing a report highlighting any inconsistencies or missing elements, so that I ensure compliance with industry best practices.
* **US010:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and handle errors during document generation, providing informative error messages and retry mechanisms, so that I can minimize disruptions and ensure reliable operation.


**Theme:** Context Management & Analysis

* **US011:** As a user, I want the system to automatically discover and analyze all relevant markdown files within my project directory, beyond just the README, so that the generated documents are based on the most complete project context.
* **US012:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently score and prioritize documentation sources based on relevance to PMBOK concepts, so that the most important information is used in document generation.
* **US013:** As a user, I want the system to provide a report detailing the context discovered, including source files and relevance scores, so that I can understand the basis of the generated documents.
* **US014:** As a user, I want the system to automatically adapt its context strategy based on the capabilities of the chosen AI model (e.g., large context models like Gemini), maximizing the use of available tokens, so that the generated documents are as accurate and comprehensive as possible.
* **US015:** As a user, I want the system to provide detailed reports on context utilization, including token counts and usage percentages, so that I can monitor and optimize the system's performance.


## Epic 2: AI Provider Integration

This epic focuses on the integration with different AI providers.

* **US016:** As a user, I want to select my preferred AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) via a user-friendly interface, so that I can leverage the best-suited model for my needs.
* **US017:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and handle failures of the selected AI provider, providing informative error messages and fallback mechanisms, so that I can minimize service disruptions.
* **US018:** As an administrator, I want the system to support multiple AI providers concurrently, allowing for seamless failover between providers, so that document generation remains reliable even if one provider is unavailable.


## Epic 3:  User Experience & Administration

This epic addresses the user interface and administrative capabilities.

* **US019:** As a user, I want a clear and concise command-line interface (CLI) with comprehensive help documentation, so that I can easily interact with the system and understand its functionalities.
* **US020:** As an administrator, I want the ability to manage user accounts and permissions, so that I can control access to the system.
* **US021:** As a user, I want the system to provide informative progress messages during document generation, so that I can monitor the process and anticipate completion time.
* **US022:** As a user, I want the system to generate a comprehensive README file summarizing the generated documents and providing an overview of the project, so that I can quickly understand the project's status and contents.


This user story document provides a comprehensive overview of the ADPA's functionalities.  Further refinement and prioritization might be needed based on specific project timelines and resource allocation.
