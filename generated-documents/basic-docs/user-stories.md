# User Stories: Project Backup Vermigerous

**Type:** Application
**Description:** This document outlines user stories for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automating the monthly backup process, ensuring data integrity, and enabling secure recovery.

## User Story Format

Each user story follows the format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."

## Epic: Automated Backup Scheduling

* **US001:** As a system administrator, I want to schedule automated monthly backups so that I don't have to manually initiate backups.
* **US002:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the backup schedule (day of the month, time) via a centralized configuration file so that I can customize the backup timing to minimize system impact.
* **US003:** As a system administrator, I want to receive email notifications upon successful completion or failure of automated backups so that I am aware of the backup status.
* **US004:** As a developer, I want the backup process to integrate seamlessly with our CI/CD pipeline so that backups are automatically triggered after each successful deployment.


## Epic: Incremental and Differential Backups

* **US005:** As a system administrator, I want the system to perform incremental or differential backups instead of full backups whenever possible so that backup time and storage space are optimized.
* **US006:** As a system administrator, I want to be able to choose between incremental and differential backup strategies via a configuration setting so that I can select the best approach for my needs.


## Epic: Validation and Integrity Checks

* **US007:** As a system administrator, I want the system to automatically generate checksums (e.g., SHA-256) for each backup so that data integrity can be verified.
* **US008:** As a system administrator, I want the system to perform post-backup validation checks, comparing checksums to detect any corruption or incompleteness so that I can quickly identify and address any issues.
* **US009:** As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts if checksum validation fails so that I can investigate and take corrective action promptly.


## Epic: Secure Storage and Recovery

* **US010:** As a system administrator, I want backups to be stored in immutable blob storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM policy) so that data is protected against accidental or malicious deletion.
* **US011:** As a system administrator, I want backups to be encrypted both at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS so that data confidentiality is maintained.
* **US012:** As a system administrator, I want backups to be replicated across multiple Azure regions so that I can ensure business continuity in case of regional outages or disasters.
* **US013:** As a system administrator, I want a simple and reliable restore process to be available so that I can quickly recover data in case of system failure.


## Epic: Metadata and Organization

* **US014:** As a system administrator, I want backups to be automatically tagged with metadata including project name, year, month, and version so that backups are easily identifiable and searchable.
* **US015:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized index (e.g., JSON file or database) to store backup metadata so that I can easily retrieve information about past backups.


## Epic: Monitoring and Alerting

* **US016:** As a system administrator, I want the system to integrate with a monitoring solution (e.g., Azure Monitor) to track backup status and performance so that I can proactively identify and address potential issues.
* **US017:** As a system administrator, I want to receive alerts for backup failures, delays, or storage threshold breaches so that I can respond promptly to critical events.


## Epic: Automated Recovery Testing

* **US018:** As a system administrator, I want the system to schedule automated restore tests in a sandbox environment so that data recoverability is regularly verified.
* **US019:** As a system administrator, I want to receive reports and alerts on any failures during automated restore tests so that I can address any issues proactively.


## Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each user story should include:

* **Given:** The initial context or preconditions.
* **When:** The action performed by the user or system.
* **Then:** The expected outcome or post-conditions.

**Example (US001):**

* **Given:** The system is configured with backup credentials and storage settings.
* **When:** The scheduled backup task runs.
* **Then:** A successful backup is created and stored in the designated location, and a success notification email is sent to the administrator.


## Priority Classification

* **High Priority:**  US001, US007, US010, US011, US013
* **Medium Priority:** US002, US003, US005, US006, US008, US009, US012, US014, US015, US018
* **Low Priority:** US004, US016, US017, US019


## Dependencies and Assumptions

* This document assumes the existence of a suitable backup storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage).
* The implementation will leverage appropriate Azure services and technologies.


## Definition of Done

* User story is implemented and thoroughly tested.
* Acceptance criteria are met.
* Code is reviewed and integrated into the main codebase.
* Documentation is updated to reflect the implemented functionality.

This detailed User Stories document provides a solid foundation for developing Project Backup Vermigerous.  Remember to refine these stories further with specific details during the sprint planning process.
