# User Stories: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

## Project Overview

ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.  It supports BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0, offering CLI and REST API interfaces.  Key features include multi-provider AI support, enterprise integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe), and robust security.


## User Story Format

Each user story follows this format:  `As a <user type>, I want <goal> so that <benefit>`.  Acceptance criteria will be defined separately for each story.


## Epics and User Stories

**Epic 1: Document Generation**

* **US001:** As a business analyst, I want to generate a BABOK v3-compliant requirements elicitation document using the CLI so that I can efficiently capture stakeholder needs.
* **US002:** As a project manager, I want to generate a PMBOK 7th Edition-compliant project charter using the REST API so that I can initiate a project quickly and consistently.
* **US003:** As a data manager, I want to generate a DMBOK 2.0-compliant data governance framework document using the web interface so that I can establish clear data management policies.
* **US004:** As a user, I want to select a specific AI provider (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, or Ollama) for document generation so that I can control the style and quality of the output.
* **US005:** As a user, I want to customize document templates with my own branding and content so that I can create professional, consistent documents.
* **US006:** As a user, I want to specify the output format (e.g., Markdown, JSON, PDF) for generated documents so that I can use them in various applications.
* **US007:** As an administrator, I want to manage and upload custom document templates so that users can access and utilize them.


**Epic 2: Enterprise Integrations**

* **US008:** As a user, I want to directly publish generated documents to Atlassian Confluence so that I can easily share them with stakeholders.
* **US009:** As a user, I want to upload documents to Microsoft SharePoint so that they are centrally managed and accessible within the organization.
* **US010:** As a user, I want to utilize Adobe Document Services for professional PDF generation and document intelligence features so that I have high-quality, secure documents.
* **US011:** As an administrator, I want to configure the integration with Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services through the admin interface.


**Epic 3: AI & Automation**

* **US012:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently manage context during document generation so that the output is relevant and accurate.
* **US013:** As a user, I want to define automated workflows for document generation, including input data collection and output distribution, so that I can automate repetitive tasks.
* **US014:** As an administrator, I want to monitor AI provider usage and costs so that I can optimize resource allocation.
* **US015:** As a user, I want the system to provide feedback on the quality of AI-generated content so that I can ensure accuracy and consistency.


**Epic 4: User Management & Security**

* **US016:** As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts and roles using a secure web interface so that I can control access to the system's features.
* **US017:** As a user, I want to be able to securely log in using multi-factor authentication so that my account is protected from unauthorized access.
* **US018:** As an administrator, I want detailed audit logs of all system activities so that I can track usage and identify potential security breaches.
* **US019:** As a user, I want to receive notifications about important system events and updates so that I am aware of any changes or issues.


**Epic 5: CLI and API Usage**

* **US020:** As a developer, I want clear and comprehensive documentation for the CLI and REST API so that I can integrate ADPA into my workflows.
* **US021:** As a user, I want intuitive and user-friendly CLI commands so that I can easily generate documents from the command line.
* **US022:** As a developer, I want well-defined OpenAPI specifications for the REST API so that I can easily integrate it with other systems.


## Prioritization

User stories will be prioritized based on business value, technical feasibility, and dependencies.  A detailed prioritization matrix will be created and maintained separately.


## Acceptance Criteria (Example - US001)

* **Given** a defined project scope and stakeholder information.
* **When** the user executes the `adpa generate --key requirements-elicitation` command.
* **Then** a BABOK v3-compliant requirements elicitation document is generated in the specified output format (e.g., Markdown, JSON).
* **And** the document includes sections for stakeholder analysis, requirement gathering techniques used, and a prioritized list of requirements.
* **And** the document adheres to the specified BABOK v3 version.


This User Story document provides a high-level overview.  Each user story will have a more detailed specification including acceptance criteria, dependencies, and estimations.
