# User Stories: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## Project Overview

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis.  It leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, stakeholder maps, and regulatory compliance documentation in seconds, significantly reducing time and effort compared to traditional methods.  This system boasts a production-ready Express.js API with an API-first design and Fortune 500 validated results.

## User Story Format

Each user story will follow this format:  "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]."  Acceptance criteria will be defined separately for each story.

## Epics and User Stories

**Epic 1: Framework Generation**

* **US001:** As a Business Analyst, I want to generate a BABOK v3 compliant requirements elicitation framework from provided stakeholder data so that I can quickly initiate a project.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The generated framework accurately reflects the provided data, adheres to BABOK v3 guidelines, and is delivered in a chosen format (e.g., JSON, PDF, DOCX).  Error handling is implemented for invalid input.
* **US002:** As a Project Manager, I want to generate a PMBOK-compliant project charter based on project details inputted via the API so that I can quickly establish project governance.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated charter is complete, adheres to PMBOK guidelines, and includes sections for objectives, stakeholders, timelines, and resources.  The format is selectable (JSON, PDF, DOCX).
* **US003:** As a Data Governance Officer, I want to generate a data management framework compliant with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) based on data asset descriptions provided via the API so that I can ensure data compliance within the organization.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The framework includes data classification, access control, and retention policies, and is compliant with specified regulations. The output is formatted correctly (JSON, PDF, DOCX).
* **US004:** As a system administrator, I want to manage available templates for document generation so that I can customize the output and ensure consistency across projects.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The system allows for the creation, modification, and deletion of templates.  Templates are validated for correctness and compliance.


**Epic 2: API Interaction and Management**

* **US005:** As a developer, I want a well-documented and robust API with comprehensive error handling so that I can easily integrate the Requirements Gathering Agent into my applications.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The API documentation (OpenAPI specification) is complete and accurate.  Error responses are informative and helpful for debugging.  The API includes rate limiting to prevent abuse.
* **US006:** As a security administrator, I want secure authentication mechanisms (API keys, JWT) to protect the API from unauthorized access so that sensitive data remains confidential.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The API supports multiple authentication methods.  Unauthorized requests are rejected with appropriate error codes.  Access logs are maintained.
* **US007:** As a user, I want to monitor the status of my document generation jobs through the API so that I can track progress and receive notifications upon completion or failure.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The API provides endpoints to retrieve job status and receive notifications (e.g., webhooks).  Job status updates are accurate and timely.


**Epic 3: Stakeholder Management and Reporting**

* **US008:** As a Business Analyst, I want the system to generate a stakeholder register and influence map based on the data I provide so that I can understand the key players and their relationships in the project.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The stakeholder register and influence map are generated accurately, showing key stakeholders, their roles, and their influence on the project.
* **US009:** As a Project Manager, I want the system to generate reports summarizing project progress and risks so that I can effectively communicate project status to stakeholders.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Reports are generated in a clear and concise format, including key metrics and visualizations.  Reporting formats are customizable.


**Epic 4:  System Administration and Maintenance**

* **US010:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor system performance and resource usage so that I can proactively address potential issues and optimize performance.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The system provides monitoring dashboards with key metrics (CPU usage, memory, request latency).  Alerting mechanisms are configured for critical issues.
* **US011:** As a system administrator, I want to manage system logs and audit trails so that I can track system activity and troubleshoot problems.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Logs are structured and searchable.  Audit trails record all significant system events.


This user story document provides a high-level overview.  Further details, including acceptance criteria and technical specifications, will be documented separately.  The priority of each user story will be determined in a subsequent prioritization meeting.
