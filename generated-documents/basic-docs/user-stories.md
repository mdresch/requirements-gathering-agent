## User Stories for ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines user stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), focusing on its core functionality, key features, and user roles.  The stories are categorized by epic to improve organization and traceability.  Acceptance criteria are defined to ensure clear understanding of successful implementation.

**Type:** User Story
**Description:** This document details user stories for the ADPA application.

**Project Overview:**

ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered documentation generator that leverages advanced context understanding and hierarchical authority recognition to produce professional-grade project management documents.  It goes beyond simple document generation, offering intelligent synthesis, self-correction, and compliance validation.  ADPA supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and offers a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant documents, including a new Technical Design Document system.

**User Story Format:**

As a `<role>`, I want `<goal>` so that `<benefit>`.

**Epics and User Stories:**

**Epic 1: Core Document Generation**

* **US001:** As a project manager, I want to generate a complete set of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documents from a README file, so that I can quickly initiate and manage my project.
* **US002:** As a business analyst, I want to generate user stories and requirements documents from various project inputs (e.g., README, requirements documents, architecture diagrams), so that I have a comprehensive understanding of project needs.
* **US003:** As a technical lead, I want to generate a complete set of technical design documents (architecture, system design, database schema, etc.), so that I can efficiently document the technical aspects of my project.
* **US004:** As a marketing manager, I want to generate executive-ready strategic business documents (company values, purpose statements), so that I can clearly communicate the project's goals and mission.
* **US005:** As a developer, I want to select the AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to use for document generation, so that I can leverage the best model for my needs and budget.
* **US006:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect and utilize the largest available context window for my chosen AI model, so that the generated documents are as accurate and comprehensive as possible.
* **US007:** As a project manager, I want the system to provide a quality assessment score and actionable recommendations for each generated document, so that I can ensure high-quality deliverables.
* **US008:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, so that I can ensure the project complies with industry best practices.
* **US009:** As a user, I want the ability to generate specific document types individually (e.g., only the risk register), so that I can focus on specific aspects of my project.
* **US010:** As a user, I want the generated documents to be organized in a clear and professional directory structure, so that they are easy to find and manage.
* **US011:** As a user, I want the option to specify the output format (Markdown, JSON, YAML), so that I can integrate the output with other tools.
* **US012:** As a user, I want a built-in version control system for generated documents, so that I can track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.


**Epic 2: Enhanced Project Analysis**

* **US013:** As a user, I want the system to automatically discover and analyze all relevant markdown files within my project, so that the generated documents incorporate the maximum amount of available context.
* **US014:** As a user, I want the system to intelligently score and prioritize discovered documentation sources based on relevance to PMBOK terminology and project management concepts, so that the most important information is used for document generation.
* **US015:** As a user, I want the system to provide a report summarizing the discovered files and their relevance scores, so that I can review the context used for document generation.


**Epic 3: Context Management and AI Provider Integration**

* **US016:** As a user, I want the system to handle failures gracefully and provide informative error messages, so that I can troubleshoot issues effectively.
* **US017:** As a user, I want the system to automatically detect the capabilities of my chosen AI model (token limits, context window size), so that it can optimize context usage for maximum accuracy.
* **US018:** As a user, I want the system to implement a fallback mechanism to a different AI provider if the primary provider is unavailable, so that document generation is not interrupted.
* **US019:** As an administrator, I want to configure the system to use specific AI providers and API keys, so that I can control access and costs.


**Epic 4: Advanced Features and Integrations**

* **US020:** As a user, I want the option to integrate ADPA with other project management tools (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint), so that I can seamlessly manage my project documentation.
* **US021:** As a user, I want the system to support a modular architecture, so that new document types and AI providers can be easily added in the future.


**Acceptance Criteria Framework:**

Each user story will have specific acceptance criteria defined based on the functionality described. These criteria will include:

* **Functionality:**  The described functionality works as expected.
* **Performance:** The functionality performs within acceptable time limits.
* **Error Handling:** The system handles errors gracefully and provides informative feedback.
* **Usability:** The functionality is easy to use and understand.
* **Security:** The functionality adheres to relevant security standards.
* **Compliance:** The functionality complies with PMBOK 7.0 standards where applicable.


**Priority Classification:**

* **High:** Critical for core functionality and MVP.
* **Medium:** Important for user experience and overall functionality.
* **Low:** Enhancements and features for future releases.


This user story document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for ADPA.  Specific acceptance criteria for each user story will be further defined during the detailed design phase.
