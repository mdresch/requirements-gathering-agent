# User Stories

## Project Overview

**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework  
**Description:** ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant Node.js/TypeScript automation framework for enterprise requirements, project, and data management. It provides CLI and API for generating professional documentation aligned with BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. The system supports AI-powered document creation, workflow automation, and enterprise integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe). It is designed for secure, scalable, and maintainable enterprise deployments.

## Epic 1: User Access & Security

### User Registration and Authentication

- **US001:**  
  *As a new user, I want to register using my enterprise identity (Microsoft Entra ID), so that I can access ADPA securely in line with my organization's policies.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Given the system is configured with Entra ID,  
    When a new user attempts to register,  
    Then the user is authenticated via Entra ID and a secure account is created.  
  **Priority:** High

- **US002:**  
  *As a registered user, I want to log in using Single Sign-On (SSO), so that I can access all ADPA features without managing separate credentials.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Given an enterprise-configured ADPA instance,  
    When a user accesses the login page,  
    Then they are redirected to SSO and authenticated seamlessly.  
  **Priority:** High

- **US003:**  
  *As a user, I want to reset my password or unlock my account via the enterprise identity provider, so that I can quickly regain access if needed.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Given a locked or forgotten account,  
    When the user requests a reset,  
    Then the process is handled via the identity provider, and access is restored securely.  
  **Priority:** High

### Role-Based Access Control & Compliance

- **US004:**  
  *As an administrator, I want to assign roles (e.g., Analyst, Project Manager, Data Steward, Admin) so that users have appropriate permissions according to their responsibilities.*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Given a set of user accounts,  
    When an admin assigns a role,  
    Then users gain access only to features permitted for that role.  
  **Priority:** High

- **US005:**  
  *As a compliance officer, I want to review audit logs of authentication and sensitive actions, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance (e.g., SOX, GDPR).*  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  - Given system activity,  
    When an audit report is requested,  
    Then all relevant authentication and access events are included and exportable.  
  **Priority:** High
