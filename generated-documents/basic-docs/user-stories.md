## User Stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines user stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), categorized by user type and functionality.  The stories are prioritized and include acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and testability.


**I. User Types:**

* **Project Manager (PM):** Responsible for overall project planning, execution, and delivery.
* **Business Analyst (BA):** Responsible for gathering and analyzing business requirements.
* **Technical Lead (TL):** Responsible for technical design and implementation.
* **Administrator:**  Manages user accounts and system settings.


**II. Epic: Core Documentation Generation**

**A. Project Manager (PM) Stories:**

* **US001 (High):** As a Project Manager, I want the system to automatically generate a PMBOK 7.0 compliant Project Charter from a provided README file and other project documentation, so that I can quickly initiate the project with a formally approved document.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated Project Charter includes all required PMBOK 7.0 sections, accurately reflects the project context from the input documents, and is free of grammatical errors and inconsistencies.  A PMBOK 7.0 compliance check confirms adherence to standards.
* **US002 (High):** As a Project Manager, I want the system to generate a comprehensive set of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management plans (Scope, Risk, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communication, Procurement), so that I have a complete and consistent set of plans to guide project execution.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Each plan is compliant with PMBOK 7.0 standards, incorporates data from the input documents, and includes relevant details specific to the project.  A PMBOK 7.0 compliance check confirms adherence to standards.  Plans are cross-referenced where appropriate.
* **US003 (High):** As a Project Manager, I want the system to generate a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary, so that I have a clear structure for project tasks and responsibilities.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The WBS accurately decomposes the project scope into manageable work packages. The WBS Dictionary provides clear and concise descriptions for each work package, including assigned resources and estimated durations.
* **US004 (Medium):** As a Project Manager, I want the system to provide a quality assessment score and recommendations for each generated document, so that I can identify areas needing improvement or further refinement.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system provides a numerical score (0-100) and detailed textual feedback on the quality of each document, including suggestions for improvement based on PMBOK standards and best practices.
* **US005 (Medium):** As a Project Manager, I want the system to automatically version control generated documents, so that I have a complete audit trail of changes and can easily revert to previous versions.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** A local Git repository is created and maintained for generated documents, with each generation resulting in a new commit with a descriptive message.  The CLI provides commands to view commit history, diffs, and revert to previous versions.


**B. Business Analyst (BA) Stories:**

* **US006 (High):** As a Business Analyst, I want the system to generate user stories and requirements from the provided project documentation, so that I have a clear and concise understanding of user needs and system functionality.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** User stories are written in the format "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]," and requirements are clearly defined with acceptance criteria.  The generated user stories and requirements accurately reflect the information in the input documents.
* **US007 (Medium):** As a Business Analyst, I want the system to generate user personas from the provided project documentation, so that I can better understand the target users and their characteristics.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** User personas are created with realistic descriptions of user demographics, goals, and motivations, based on information extracted from the input documents.


**C. Technical Lead (TL) Stories:**

* **US008 (High):** As a Technical Lead, I want the system to generate comprehensive technical design documents (architecture, system design, database schema, API documentation, security design, performance requirements, integration design, technical stack, deployment architecture, error handling), so that I have a complete set of technical specifications for implementation.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Each technical design document is complete, well-structured, and uses appropriate technical terminology. The documents accurately reflect the project's technical requirements and design decisions.
* **US009 (Medium):** As a Technical Lead, I want the system to support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), so that I can choose the best provider based on project needs and cost considerations.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system can be configured to use different AI providers, and the generated documents are consistent regardless of the chosen provider.


**D. Administrator Stories:**

* **US010 (Medium):** As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts and permissions, so that I can control access to the system.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** A user management interface allows adding, deleting, and modifying user accounts.  Roles and permissions can be assigned to users, controlling their access to specific functionalities.
* **US011 (Low):** As an administrator, I want to monitor system usage and performance metrics, so that I can identify potential issues and optimize resource allocation.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The system provides reports on user activity, API usage, and processing times.


**III. Epic: System Enhancements**

* **US012 (Medium):** As a user, I want the system to provide clear and concise error messages and guidance for troubleshooting, so that I can easily resolve any issues encountered.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Error messages are informative and user-friendly, including suggestions for resolution.  Comprehensive documentation is available for troubleshooting common problems.
* **US013 (Low):** As a user, I want the system to support different output formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML), so that I can integrate the generated documents with other tools and systems.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system allows users to select the desired output format via CLI flags, and the output is correctly formatted and validated.
* **US014 (Low):** As a user, I want the ability to customize the generated documents with project-specific branding and templates, so that the output aligns with our corporate style guide.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The system allows users to provide custom templates or branding elements, and the generated documents reflect these customizations.


**IV. Priority Classification:**

* **High:** Critical for core functionality and MVP.
* **Medium:** Important for user experience and satisfaction.
* **Low:** Enhancements for future releases.


This user story document provides a comprehensive starting point.  Further refinement may be needed as the project evolves and new requirements emerge.  This document should be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the development lifecycle.
