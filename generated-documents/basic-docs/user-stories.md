# User Stories

## Project Overview
**Project:**  [Project Name - Needs to be defined]
**Type:** Application (Needs further specification, e.g., Web Application, Mobile App, Desktop Application)
**Description:**  [Detailed description of the application's purpose and intended functionality is needed.  E.g., "This application is a CRM designed to manage customer interactions, track sales leads, and streamline communication within a sales team."]


## User Story Format
Each user story follows the format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."


## Epic: Core Functionality

### User Registration and Authentication
- **US001:** As a new user, I want to create an account with a secure password using email verification so that I can access the system securely.
- **US002:** As a registered user, I want to log in securely using my username or email and password,  with options for multi-factor authentication (MFA), so that I can access my personal data safely.
- **US003:** As a user, I want to reset my password via email or a security question so that I can regain access if I forget it.


### Main User Journey
- **US004:** As a user, I want an intuitive dashboard displaying key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to my role so that I can quickly assess the system's status and my progress.
- **US005:** As a user, I want clear and consistent navigation throughout the application, including a sitemap or search functionality, so that I can efficiently complete my tasks.
- **US006:** As a user, I want clear and concise feedback messages for all actions, including error handling and progress indicators, so that I know when operations succeed or fail.


## Epic: Data Management  (Requires further definition of data types and management needs)

### Data Input
- **US007:** As a user, I want to input data through user-friendly forms with input validation so that I can provide necessary information accurately and efficiently.
- **US008:** As a user, I want real-time validation of my input, including error messages and suggestions, so that I can correct errors immediately.
- **US009:** As a user, I want to save my work as a draft and resume later so that I don't lose my progress.


### Data Viewing
- **US010:** As a user, I want to view my data in customizable lists and tables, sortable and filterable by various criteria, so that I can find information quickly.
- **US011:** As a user, I want robust search and filter capabilities, including full-text search and advanced filtering options, so that I can locate specific items efficiently.
- **US012:** As a user, I want to export data in common formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) so that I can use it in other systems.


## Epic: System Administration (Only applicable if the application requires administration)

### User Management
- **US013:** As an administrator, I want to manage user accounts, including creation, modification, and deletion, so that I can control system access.
- **US014:** As an administrator, I want to assign user roles with different permission levels so that I can control access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- **US015:** As an administrator, I want to monitor system usage, including user activity and performance metrics, through reporting dashboards, so that I can identify areas for improvement and ensure optimal performance.


## Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each user story should include:
- **Given** - the initial context and preconditions.
- **When** - the action performed by the user.
- **Then** - the expected outcome and system response.  (Specific examples are needed based on the individual user story).


## Priority Classification
- **High Priority:** User registration, login, core data input and viewing functionalities.
- **Medium Priority:**  Dashboard functionality, advanced search and filtering, data export.
- **Low Priority:**  MFA, detailed system administration features.


## Dependencies and Assumptions
- User stories assume basic internet connectivity and a modern web browser.
- Stories may depend on third-party integrations (specify which ones).
- Technical implementation details, including technology stack and database design, will be defined separately.


## Definition of Done
- User story is implemented and fully tested with unit and integration tests.
- Acceptance criteria are met.
- Code review is completed and approved.
- Relevant documentation is updated, including user manuals and API documentation (if applicable).


**Note:** This document provides a framework.  The project's success hinges on completing the missing information in bracketed sections, particularly a detailed project description and specific data management requirements.  The user stories need further refinement based on detailed requirements gathering.
