## Definition of Done

A user story is complete when:
- Functionality is implemented and tested (unit/integration as needed)
- All acceptance criteria are satisfied
- Code is peer-reviewed and merged
- Documentation (user/admin/technical) is updated accordingly

---

## Practical Guidance

- **For project teams:** Use the CLI for quick generation, the API for integration with other tools, and the web admin for managing templates and monitoring.
- **For administrators:** Ensure integrations (e.g., AI providers, Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe) are configured early; review analytics for adoption.
- **For enterprise adoption:** Leverage compliance and SSO features for rapid scaling; customize templates to align with your organization’s standards.
