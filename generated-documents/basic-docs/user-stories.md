# User Stories: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## Project Overview

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis.  It leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, stakeholder maps, and regulatory compliance documentation in seconds, significantly reducing time and effort compared to traditional methods.  This system is designed for Fortune 500 level enterprises and offers API-first design, multi-format output (PDF, DOCX, HTML), and robust security features.


## Epic:  BABOK Framework Generation

### High Priority

* **US001:** As a Business Analyst, I want to upload a JSON file containing project details (stakeholders, requirements, regulatory context) so that the system can generate a complete BABOK v3 compliant framework.
* **US002:** As a Project Manager, I want the system to automatically incorporate relevant regulatory compliance information (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX) into the generated framework, so that I ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.
* **US003:** As a Business Analyst, I want the system to generate a comprehensive stakeholder map, identifying key stakeholders and their influence, so that I can effectively manage communication and expectations.
* **US004:** As a System Administrator, I want to monitor the status of framework generation jobs in real-time, including estimated completion times and error messages, so that I can proactively address any issues.
* **US005:** As a Business Analyst, I want the system to generate the framework in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML), so that I can easily share the document with stakeholders who prefer different formats.


### Medium Priority

* **US006:** As a Business Analyst, I want the ability to customize the generated framework using pre-defined templates or create my own custom templates, so that I can tailor the output to specific project needs.
* **US007:** As a Business Analyst, I want the system to provide a detailed audit trail of framework generation, including input data, processing steps, and generated output, for transparency and traceability.
* **US008:** As a System Administrator, I want the ability to configure rate limits and API keys for secure access to the system, so that I can manage and control API usage.


## Epic: API Interaction & Management

### High Priority

* **US009:** As a Developer, I want a well-documented RESTful API with clear endpoints for uploading data, initiating jobs, checking job status, and downloading generated documents, so that I can easily integrate the system into other applications.
* **US010:** As a Developer, I want comprehensive error handling and detailed error messages within the API, so that I can effectively debug and resolve integration issues.
* **US011:** As a System Administrator, I want robust security measures in place, including API key authentication and rate limiting, to protect the system from unauthorized access.


### Medium Priority

* **US012:** As a Developer, I want the ability to use OpenAPI specifications to understand and interact with the API, so that I can easily integrate with the system using various programming languages.


## Epic:  User Interface & Experience (Future Considerations)

### Medium Priority

* **US013:** As a Business Analyst, I want a user-friendly web interface to interact with the system, so that I can easily upload data, manage jobs, and download generated documents without requiring command-line interaction.


## Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each user story will have associated acceptance criteria defined using the Given-When-Then format.  For example, for US001:

* **Given** a valid JSON file containing project details is uploaded.
* **When** the user initiates the framework generation process.
* **Then** the system generates a BABOK v3 compliant framework and provides a unique job ID.
* **Then** the generated framework accurately reflects the information provided in the input JSON file.
* **Then** the generated framework is available for download in the specified format(s).


## Priority Classification

* **High Priority:** Essential for core functionality and MVP release.
* **Medium Priority:** Important features enhancing usability and functionality, planned for subsequent releases.


## Dependencies and Assumptions

* All user stories assume a properly functioning API server.
* Some user stories may depend on the availability of specific AI providers or external services.
*  The system will handle potential errors gracefully and provide informative feedback to the user.

## Definition of Done

A user story is considered "done" when:

* The functionality is fully implemented and tested.
* All acceptance criteria are met.
* Code is reviewed and approved.
* Relevant documentation is updated.


This User Story document provides a comprehensive overview of the requirements for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  Specific details and acceptance criteria will be further elaborated upon in subsequent documentation.
