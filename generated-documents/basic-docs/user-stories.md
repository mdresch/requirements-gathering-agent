# User Stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines user stories for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), categorized by user type and functionality.  The stories are prioritized and include acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and testability.

**Project Overview:** ADPA is an AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive project management documentation based on PMBOK 7.0 standards. It leverages multiple AI providers, performs intelligent project analysis, and offers a robust command-line interface.  ADPA also generates technical design documents and translates technical context into strategic business communications.


## User Types

* **Project Manager (PM):** Responsible for overall project planning, execution, and delivery.
* **Business Analyst (BA):** Responsible for requirements gathering and analysis.
* **Technical Lead (TL):** Responsible for the technical aspects of the project.
* **Executive Sponsor (ES):** Provides overall direction and authorization.
* **Administrator (Admin):** Manages user accounts and system settings.


## User Stories

**Epic: Core Documentation Generation**

* **As a PM,** I want the system to generate a complete PMBOK 7.0 compliant project charter from my project's README and other documentation, so that I have a formally authorized project document quickly.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated charter includes all mandatory PMBOK sections, accurately reflects project information from input sources, and is formatted correctly.  A validation report indicates PMBOK 7.0 compliance.
* **As a BA,** I want the system to generate a requirements document from my project's README and other documentation, so that I have a comprehensive overview of project needs.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated requirements document accurately reflects requirements extracted from input sources, is well-structured, and includes traceability to original sources.
* **As a PM,** I want the system to generate all key PMBOK planning documents (scope, risk, communication, etc.), so that I have a complete set of project management plans.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  All generated plans are complete, consistent, and compliant with PMBOK 7.0 standards.  A validation report indicates compliance and identifies areas for improvement.
* **As an ES,** I want the system to generate executive summaries of key project documents (charter, scope statement, risk register), so that I can quickly understand the project status and risks.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Executive summaries are concise, accurate, and highlight key information relevant to executive decision-making.


**Epic: Technical Documentation Generation**

* **As a TL,** I want the system to generate a complete set of technical design documents (architecture, database schema, API documentation, etc.), so that I have a comprehensive technical specification.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** All technical documents are complete, consistent, and use appropriate technical terminology.  They are professionally formatted and include detailed explanations.
* **As a TL,** I want the ability to generate individual technical design documents using specific CLI commands, so that I can quickly access specific parts of the technical specifications.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Each CLI command correctly generates the specified document.  The generated documents are complete and accurate.


**Epic: Strategic Communication Generation**

* **As an ES,** I want the system to generate a compelling company purpose statement and core values based on the project's context, so that I can clearly communicate the project's mission and values.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The generated statements are authentic, reflect the project's goals and values, and are suitable for public communication.
* **As a PM,** I want the system to generate a concise project vision statement, so that I can clearly articulate the project's long-term goals.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The vision statement is concise, inspiring, and clearly defines the desired future state of the project.


**Epic: Advanced Features and Analysis**

* **As a PM,** I want the system to perform a comprehensive analysis of my project's documentation beyond the README, so that all relevant information is incorporated into the generated documents.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system identifies and analyzes relevant files, assigns relevance scores, and prioritizes information effectively.  A report summarizing the analysis is provided.
* **As a PM,** I want the system to provide detailed quality scores and recommendations for each generated document, so that I can identify areas for improvement.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** Quality scores accurately reflect the document's completeness, structure, and adherence to standards. Recommendations are specific and actionable.
* **As an Admin,** I want the ability to manage user accounts and access permissions, so that I can control who can access and use the system.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  Users can be added, removed, and assigned roles with appropriate permissions.  Access control mechanisms are secure and auditable.


**Epic:  System Usability and Maintenance**

* **As a PM,** I want a clear and intuitive command-line interface, so that I can easily generate documents and manage configurations.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  The CLI is easy to use, provides helpful messages, and allows for flexible configuration.  Comprehensive documentation is available.
* **As an Admin,** I want the system to log all actions and changes, so that I can maintain an audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**  All user actions, document generation events, and configuration changes are logged with timestamps and user identifiers. Logs are easily accessible and searchable.
* **As a TL,** I want the system to support multiple AI providers, so that I can choose the best provider for my needs.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:** The system seamlessly integrates with and switches between supported AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  Appropriate fallback mechanisms are in place.


This user story document provides a starting point and will be iteratively refined as the project progresses and new requirements emerge.  Further user stories will be added to cover specific aspects of the system's features, such as the version control system and modular processor architecture.
