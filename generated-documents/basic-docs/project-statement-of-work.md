# Project Statement of Work

**Project Name:**  
ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (formerly Requirements Gathering Agent)

**Version:**  
3.2.4

**Prepared for:**  
Enterprise IT, Project Management Offices, Business Analysis Teams, and Data Governance Departments

---

## 1. Executive Summary

ADPA is a modular, standards-compliant automation framework designed to transform enterprise document processing, project management, and business analysis through AI-powered generation and automation. Built on Node.js and TypeScript, it delivers both CLI and REST API interfaces for efficient, secure, and standards-driven production of business-critical documents. ADPA fully supports frameworks such as BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0, with robust integrations for enterprise platforms and compliance with leading regulatory standards.

## 2. Project Purpose and Objectives

**Purpose:**  
To provide enterprise organizations with a production-ready automation platform for intelligent, standards-compliant documentation and process management, significantly reducing manual effort, increasing accuracy, and ensuring regulatory and best-practice alignment.

**Objectives:**
- Automate the generation of professional project, business, and data management documents to BABOK, PMBOK, and DMBOK standards.
- Integrate with leading AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) for adaptive, context-aware content generation.
- Enable seamless deployment via CLI, REST API, and web admin portal.
- Deliver out-of-the-box integrations with Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, and version control systems.
- Ensure enterprise-grade security, authentication, and regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS, Basel III, etc.).
- Support scalable, microservices-based deployments for Fortune 500 and highly regulated environments.
