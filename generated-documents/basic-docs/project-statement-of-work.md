# Project Statement of Work: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This Project Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the scope, deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria for the development and delivery of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA), a revolutionary enterprise business analysis automation platform.  This project leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant frameworks and other project documentation in seconds, significantly reducing time and effort in requirements gathering and project planning.  The ADPA-RGA is a production-ready Express.js API with an API-first design, validated against Fortune 500-level scenarios.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to deliver a fully functional and tested ADPA-RGA that meets the requirements specified herein.  This includes:

* Development of a robust and scalable Express.js API adhering to API-first principles.
* Implementation of a BABOK v3 compliant framework generation engine.
* Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) with fallback mechanisms.
* Generation of high-quality deliverables in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* Comprehensive documentation including API specifications, user guides, and technical documentation.
* Successful completion of rigorous testing and validation.

**3. Project Scope**

The project scope encompasses the following key deliverables:

* **Development of the ADPA-RGA API:**  This includes designing, developing, testing, and deploying a production-ready Express.js API with comprehensive error handling, authentication (API key and JWT support), rate limiting, and input validation using Zod schemas.  The API will expose endpoints for document generation, template management, and job status tracking.

* **BABOK v3 Framework Generation Engine:**  Development of an engine capable of generating complete BABOK v3 compliant frameworks based on provided input data.  This engine will adhere to the BABOK v3 methodology, incorporating stakeholder analysis, requirements elicitation, and regulatory compliance (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).

* **Multi-Provider AI Integration:**  The system will integrate with multiple AI providers to provide flexibility and redundancy.  This integration will include robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

* **Multi-Format Output Generation:** The system will generate outputs in multiple formats, including PDF, DOCX, and HTML, suitable for enterprise consumption.

* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  This includes API specifications (OpenAPI 3.0), user guides, technical documentation, and a detailed architecture document.

* **Testing and Validation:**  Rigorous testing will be conducted to ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance testing and security audits.  This will include validation against real-world enterprise scenarios (Fortune 500 data sets).

**4. Deliverables**

The following deliverables will be provided upon project completion:

* Fully functional and tested ADPA-RGA API deployed to a production environment.
* Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI 3.0 specification).
* User guides and tutorials for system operation.
* Technical documentation detailing the system architecture and implementation.
* Test reports demonstrating successful completion of all testing phases.
* Source code (as agreed upon).
