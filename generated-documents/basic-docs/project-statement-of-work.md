# Project Statement of Work (SOW)

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Client:**  [Client Name/Organization -  If applicable. Otherwise, state "Internal Project"]

**3. Project Manager:** [Project Manager Name]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Start Date]

**5. Project Completion Date:** [Completion Date]


**6. Project Scope:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop and deploy the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a sophisticated AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive project management documentation adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  ADPA will significantly enhance project initiation, planning, and execution by automating the creation of various project artifacts.  The project includes, but is not limited to:

* **Strategic Business Inception Engine:**  ADPA will generate a complete suite of foundational documents, including a business case, stakeholder register, project scope statement, risk register, and project charter, effectively automating strategic project initiation.  This capability represents a paradigm shift from simple document generation to AI-powered strategic business intelligence.

* **Comprehensive PMBOK Document Suite:** ADPA will automatically generate a full set of 29 PMBOK-compliant documents, covering all project management knowledge areas. This includes initiating, planning, executing, monitoring & controlling, and closing process groups.

* **AI-Powered Technical Design Documentation Suite:** ADPA will generate ten distinct technical design documents, including system architecture, system design, database schema, API documentation, security design, performance requirements, integration design, technical stack, deployment architecture, and error handling.  These documents will leverage specialized AI prompts and professional templates for high-quality output.

* **Business Communication Translator System:** ADPA will translate technical project context into high-quality strategic business documents such as company values, purpose statements, and mission/vision statements.

* **Enhanced Project Analysis Engine:** ADPA's analysis engine will go beyond the project's README.md file, intelligently discovering and analyzing all relevant project documentation (requirements, architecture, stakeholder information, technical specifications) to build comprehensive context for document generation.  It will score and prioritize these sources based on relevance and content quality.

* **Enhanced Context Manager:**  ADPA utilizes a three-phase context strategy to optimize context utilization for various Large Language Models (LLMs), maximizing the accuracy and detail of generated documents.  This includes support for models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4, Claude, and Ollama.

* **Built-in Version Control System:** ADPA incorporates a version control system (VCS) for all generated documents, automatically tracking changes and providing a complete audit trail.

* **Modular Processor Architecture:** ADPA employs a modular architecture, allowing for easy expansion and customization of document types and AI provider integration.


**7. Deliverables:**

* Fully functional ADPA application (Node.js/TypeScript)
* Comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and API reference.
* Deployment guide and installation instructions.
* Source code repository (GitHub).
* PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation report.
* Project kickoff preparations checklist
