# Project Statement of Work: Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of work for the development of a Self-Charging Electric Vehicle (SCEV), a revolutionary concept aiming to significantly reduce reliance on traditional charging infrastructure by harvesting ambient energy.  This project focuses on the initial phases of development, culminating in a functional test mule demonstrating the core energy harvesting and management technologies.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a holistic energy harvesting system integrated into an existing electric vehicle (EV).  Specific objectives include:

*   Successfully research, select, and prototype three core energy harvesting technologies: advanced photovoltaic body panels, regenerative suspension, and thermoelectric generation.
*   Develop a functional prototype of each core technology and integrate them into a test mule EV.
*   Develop a basic Energy Management Unit (EMU) capable of data acquisition and logging from the integrated systems.
*   Collect and analyze real-world performance data from the test mule under various operating conditions.

**3. Project Scope**

**3.1 Included:**

*   Research and selection of optimal photovoltaic, kinetic, and thermoelectric technologies.
*   Design, fabrication, and testing of prototypes for each core technology.
*   Integration of prototypes into a pre-selected test mule EV.
*   Development of the EMU v1.0 for data acquisition and logging.
*   Data collection and analysis from real-world testing.
*   Preparation of a comprehensive final report documenting findings and recommendations.

**3.2 Excluded:**

*   Full-scale vehicle design and manufacturing.
*   Development of the complete EMU control logic and optimization algorithms (beyond data acquisition and logging in v1.0).
*   Extensive durability and reliability testing.
*   Regulatory compliance and certification.
*   Mass production planning and manufacturing processes.

**4. Deliverables**

The following deliverables will be provided at the completion of each milestone:

*   **Milestone 1 (Component Feasibility & Simulation):**  A comprehensive report detailing the research findings, technology selection rationale, and simulation results demonstrating potential energy gains.  This includes detailed specifications for the chosen technologies.
*   **Milestone 2 (Prototype Development):** Functional prototypes of the photovoltaic body panel section, a single regenerative shock absorber, and a TEG unit, along with detailed testing reports and performance data.
*   **Milestone 3 (Test Mule Integration):** The integrated test mule EV with the prototype systems installed, along with initial real-world performance data collected from various driving scenarios.
*   **Milestone 4 (EMU v1.0):** A functional EMU v1.0 capable of data acquisition and logging from all integrated systems, along with comprehensive documentation.  A final report summarizing the project findings, conclusions, and recommendations for future development will also be delivered.

**5. Timeline**

A detailed project timeline will be developed and provided separately, outlining specific tasks, durations, and dependencies for each milestone.  This timeline will be subject to revision based on the progress and unforeseen challenges.

**6. Assumptions and Constraints**

*   The availability of a suitable electric vehicle as a test mule is assumed.
*   Access to necessary laboratory facilities and equipment is assumed.
*   The project timeline is subject to change based on the availability of components and unforeseen technical challenges.
*   Funding is secured for the duration of the project as outlined in the separate budget proposal.

**7. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered successfully completed upon the successful completion of all four milestones and delivery of all specified deliverables, meeting the acceptance criteria defined within each milestone's report.  The final report will serve as the primary acceptance document.

**8. Communication Plan**

Regular progress reports will be provided to stakeholders, including weekly update meetings and monthly summary reports.  Any significant deviations from the plan will be communicated promptly.


**9. Project Management**
