# Project Statement of Work: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of work for enhancing the Project Backup Vermigerous system.  The primary goal is to improve the backup process by automating tasks, ensuring data integrity, and enabling secure and reliable recovery in the event of system failure.  Currently, Project Backup Vermigerous performs monthly backups, categorized by year and month. This project aims to significantly improve upon this existing functionality.

**2. Project Objectives**

* Automate the monthly backup process.
* Implement incremental or differential backups to optimize storage and time efficiency.
* Validate data integrity after each backup.
* Securely store backups using an immutable, encrypted storage solution.
* Implement automated recovery testing.
* Establish monitoring and alerting mechanisms to proactively identify and address potential issues.

**3. Scope of Work**

This project encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of the following:

* **Automated Backup Scheduling:**  Implement a robust scheduling mechanism (e.g., cron jobs, Azure Automation, PowerShell scripts) to trigger monthly backups. This will include error handling and logging.  Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines will be considered if applicable.

* **Incremental/Differential Backups:**  Implement either incremental or differential backup strategies to minimize storage consumption and backup time.  The optimal strategy will be determined based on analysis of existing data and system performance.

* **Data Integrity Validation:**  Implement checksum generation (e.g., SHA-256) and post-backup validation to ensure data integrity.  This will include automated comparison of checksums and alerting on any discrepancies.

* **Secure Storage:** Migrate backups to a secure, immutable storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy).  Implement AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS encryption in transit. Multi-region replication for disaster recovery will be explored.

* **Metadata Management:**  Automate the tagging of backups with metadata including project name, year, month, and version.  A centralized metadata index (e.g., JSON or database) will be implemented for easy retrieval and management.

* **Automated Recovery Testing:** Implement automated restore tests in a dedicated sandbox environment to validate the recoverability of backups.  Comprehensive logging and alerting will be included to identify any failures.

* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Integrate with a monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, Grafana) to track backup status, storage usage, and other relevant metrics.  Configure alerts for backup failures, delays, and storage threshold breaches.

**4. Deliverables**

* Fully automated backup system meeting the objectives outlined above.
* Comprehensive documentation including system architecture diagrams, implementation details, and user guides.
* A tested and validated recovery process.
* A monitoring and alerting system fully integrated with the backup process.


**5. Timeline**

*(Insert a detailed project timeline here, broken down into phases with estimated durations.  This should include milestones and key deadlines.)*

**6. Assumptions**

* Access to necessary infrastructure (servers, storage, etc.) will be provided.
* Relevant permissions and credentials will be granted.
* Existing backup data will be analyzed to inform design decisions.

**7. Exclusions**

* This project does not include the development of new applications or systems outside of the scope of enhancing the backup process.
* This project does not include the migration of existing data to a new platform unless specified otherwise.

**8. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete and accepted upon successful demonstration of:

* Automated, scheduled backups functioning correctly.
* Successful data restoration from backups.
* Fully functional monitoring and alerting system.
* Comprehensive documentation.


**9. Project Team**

*(List the project team members and their roles.)*

**10. Communication Plan**

*(Outline the communication plan, including frequency of meetings, reporting mechanisms, and contact information.)*


**11. Approvals**
