This includes intelligent source discovery, relevance scoring (0-100), and automatic categorization of discovered files.

* **Intelligent Context Building:** ADPA will build a comprehensive project context by prioritizing high-scoring, relevant documentation sources; integrating content from multiple files; balancing context size to avoid token overflow while maximizing information; and suggesting the most valuable source files for manual review.

* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliant Document Generation:** ADPA will generate a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents, including but not limited to:
