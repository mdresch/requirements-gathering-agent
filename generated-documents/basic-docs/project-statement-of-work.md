# Project Statement of Work: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of work for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project (hereinafter referred to as "the Agent"), a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis using AI and a BABOK v3 compliant framework.  The Agent generates Fortune 500-grade deliverables in seconds, significantly reducing the time and effort required for traditional requirements gathering. This Statement of Work (SOW) details the project's objectives, deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objective of this project is to deliver a fully functional and tested ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, capable of:

* Generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks from provided input data.
* Supporting multiple AI providers for enhanced flexibility and scalability.
* Providing a robust and secure API for enterprise integration.
* Delivering multi-format output (e.g., PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* Integrating with existing enterprise systems (as specified in Appendix A).

**3. Scope of Work**

The scope of work includes, but is not limited to:

* **API Development:** Design, development, testing, and deployment of a production-ready Express.js API adhering to API-first principles (using TypeSpec). This includes comprehensive error handling, authentication (API key and JWT support), rate limiting, and input validation.
* **AI Integration:** Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) with a robust fallback mechanism.
* **Document Generation Engine:** Development of a highly efficient engine capable of generating various BABOK v3 compliant documents.
* **Template Management:** Creation and management system for custom templates, enabling users to tailor the output.
* **Testing:** Comprehensive testing of the API and document generation engine, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance testing.
* **Documentation:** Creation of comprehensive documentation including API specifications (OpenAPI 3.0), user guides, and developer documentation.
* **Deployment:** Deployment of the API to a production-ready environment (details specified in Appendix B).


**4. Exclusions**

This project explicitly excludes:

* Development of custom AI models. The Agent will utilize existing commercially available AI models.
* Integration with specific third-party project management tools beyond those explicitly listed in Appendix A.
* On-site training beyond the provided documentation.
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial warranty period (specified in Appendix C).

**5. Deliverables**

The key deliverables for this project are:

* Fully functional and tested ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API.
* Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI specification and user guide).
* User documentation, including tutorials and quick start guides.
* Developer documentation, including architecture diagrams and code examples.
* Deployment to the specified production environment.
* Sample generated documents demonstrating the Agent's capabilities.


**6. Timeline**

The project timeline is estimated to be [Number] weeks, with key milestones outlined in Appendix D.  This timeline is subject to change based on unforeseen circumstances and will be regularly reviewed and updated.

**7. Acceptance Criteria**

The Agent will be considered accepted upon successful completion of all testing phases and the demonstration of the following:

* The API functions correctly and meets all specified requirements.
* All generated documents are compliant with BABOK v3 standards.
* The API demonstrates expected performance under load testing.
* All documentation is complete and accurate.
* The Agent is successfully deployed to the production environment.

**8. Payment Terms**

Payment terms will be [Specify payment terms and schedule].

**9. Intellectual Property**

All intellectual property rights related to the Agent will be owned by [Specify IP ownership].

**10.  Governing Law**

This SOW shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Specify Jurisdiction].
