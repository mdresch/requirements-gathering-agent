**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Sponsor:** [Insert Sponsor Name and Title]

**3. Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name and Title]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Insert Start Date]

**5. Project Completion Date:** [Insert Completion Date]  (Note: This is an estimate and subject to change based on project progress and unforeseen circumstances.)

**6. Project Objectives:**

The primary objective of this project is to develop and deploy the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a sophisticated AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project management documentation.  Secondary objectives include:

* Achieving a minimum of 250 weekly downloads on NPM within six months of launch.
* Expanding the tool's capabilities to encompass a wider range of document types and AI providers.
* Maintaining a high level of user satisfaction and positive community engagement.
* Establishing ADPA as the leading AI-powered solution for project documentation generation.


**7. Project Scope:**

ADPA will encompass the following functionalities:

* **Comprehensive Project Documentation Generation:**  Automated generation of a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents, including but not limited to: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Communication Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, Quality Management Plan, Procurement Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule Network Diagram, Milestone List, and various other project planning and management artifacts.  The tool will also generate strategic documents such as a Purpose Statement and Company Values.
* **Technical Design Documentation Generation:**  Creation of 10 specialized technical design documents: Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, and Error Handling.
* **Enhanced Project Analysis:** Intelligent analysis of project documentation beyond the README.md file, including requirements documents, architecture documentation, stakeholder information, and other relevant project files.  This includes smart relevance scoring and automatic categorization of discovered files.
* **Enhanced Context Management:** A three-phase context strategy that optimizes context utilization for various AI models, maximizing accuracy and detail in generated documents.
* **Multiple AI Provider Support:** Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), allowing users to select their preferred provider.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Built-in validation to ensure generated documents adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This includes document completeness checks, quality assessment scores, cross-document consistency checks, and detailed compliance reports.
* **Version Control System:** A built-in version control system for generated documents, allowing users to track changes, revert to previous versions, and optionally sync with a remote repository.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A user-friendly CLI for easy access and control over all functionalities.
* **Modular Architecture:** An extensible architecture allowing for easy addition of new document types and features.


**Out of Scope:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana).  This may be considered in future phases.
* Support for non-markdown input formats.
* Custom template creation functionality (pre-built, professional templates will be provided).


**8. Deliverables:**

* Fully functional and tested ADPA software application.
* Comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and FAQs.
* Deployment guide for various environments.
* Source code repository with version control.
* Ongoing maintenance and support (defined in separate service level agreement).


**9. Acceptance Criteria:**

The project will be considered complete and successfully delivered when:

* ADPA successfully generates all specified document types with high accuracy and PMBOK 7.0 compliance.
* The user documentation is comprehensive and easy to understand.
* The application is thoroughly tested and free of critical bugs.
* The application meets the performance requirements outlined in the technical design documents.
* The project is delivered on time and within budget.


**10. Project Milestones:**
