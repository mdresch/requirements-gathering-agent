# Project Statement of Work: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of work for the Advanced Document Processing & Automation (ADPA) Framework project.  ADPA, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework designed for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.  This project focuses on delivering a production-ready version of ADPA, incorporating key features outlined below.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of this project is to deliver a fully functional and robust ADPA framework capable of generating high-quality, standards-compliant documentation across multiple industry frameworks (BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0).  Specific objectives include:

*   Complete implementation of DMBOK 2.0 support.
*   Development of Docker containerization and Kubernetes deployment templates.
*   Creation of an advanced analytics dashboard.
*   Implementation of enterprise-grade Single Sign-On (SSO) integration.
*   Development of advanced workflow automation capabilities.
*   Implementation of real-time collaboration features within the framework.
*   Exploration of mobile application support feasibility.

**3. Project Scope**

**3.1 Included:**

*   Development and testing of all features listed in the "Project Goals and Objectives" section.
*   Comprehensive documentation, including user guides, API specifications, and system architecture diagrams.
*   Implementation of robust testing procedures, including unit, integration, and performance testing.
*   Maintenance and support during the initial deployment phase.
*   Addressing any critical bugs or security vulnerabilities discovered during testing and deployment.

**3.2 Excluded:**

*   Integration with specific client systems beyond those explicitly defined in the project requirements.  (e.g.,  specific CRM or ERP systems).  These integrations may be considered as future phases.
*   Custom template development beyond the core framework templates provided.  Custom templates will be considered on a case-by-case basis and may require a separate Statement of Work.
*   Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial deployment phase.  A separate maintenance agreement will be established post-deployment.
*   Development of features beyond the scope defined in this document.  Feature additions will require a change request process and a revised Statement of Work.

**4. Deliverables**

*   Production-ready ADPA framework codebase (including source code and compiled artifacts).
*   Comprehensive documentation package (user manuals, API specifications, architecture diagrams, testing reports).
*   Docker container image and Kubernetes deployment templates.
*   Advanced analytics dashboard.
*   Fully functional SSO integration.
*   Automated workflow engine.

**5. Timeline**

The project timeline is estimated at [Number] months, divided into the following phases:

*   **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):**  DMBOK 2.0 implementation, Docker containerization, and initial testing.
*   **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):**  Development of the advanced analytics dashboard, Kubernetes deployment templates, and SSO integration.
*   **Phase 3 (Months 7-9):**  Implementation of advanced workflow automation and real-time collaboration features.  Final testing and deployment.

A detailed Gantt chart will be provided separately.

**6. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete upon successful completion of all deliverables and satisfactory performance testing, demonstrating that ADPA meets the defined acceptance criteria, including:

*   All features listed in the scope are fully functional and meet the defined specifications.
*   The system is stable, reliable, and scalable.
*   The documentation is complete and easy to understand.
*   The system meets all security and compliance requirements.

**7. Assumptions**

*   The client will provide timely access to necessary resources and information.
*   The client will approve the project plan and any necessary changes in a timely manner.
*   The client will provide feedback and approval on deliverables as scheduled.


**8. Risks and Mitigation Strategies**

*   **Risk:**  Unexpected technical challenges during integration with AI providers.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Thorough testing and contingency planning for each AI provider.  Failover mechanisms are already built in.
*   **Risk:**  Delays in obtaining necessary approvals or resources.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Proactive communication and regular progress updates with the client.
*   **Risk:**  Changes in project requirements.
    *   **Mitigation:**  A formal change request process will be implemented.


**9. Payment Terms**

Payment will be made according to the following schedule: [Specify payment schedule and milestones].

**10. Communication Plan**

Regular progress reports will be provided to the client [Specify frequency and methods of communication].  A dedicated communication channel will be established for efficient feedback and issue resolution.


**11. Project Team**

The project team comprises experienced professionals with expertise in software development, AI integration, and project management. A detailed team structure will be provided separately.
