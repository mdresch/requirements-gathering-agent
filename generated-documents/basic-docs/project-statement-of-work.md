# Project Statement of Work: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**1. Introduction**

This Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the scope, deliverables, timelines, and acceptance criteria for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, version 2.2.0.  The RGA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation, significantly enhancing efficiency and accuracy in the requirements gathering phase of project management.  This project directly supports the company's strategic goals of advancing API management within the banking industry and enhancing customer centricity, while adhering to all relevant international legislation.


**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop and deploy a robust, scalable, and user-friendly Requirements Gathering Agent capable of generating high-quality PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* **Objectives:**
    * Automate the generation of project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, work breakdown structures, and compliance documentation.
    * Integrate securely with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google Generative AI, etc.) utilizing managed identities.
    * Ensure generated documents are in a validated JSON format for seamless interoperability.
    * Provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for ease of use and configuration management.
    * Implement comprehensive schema validation to maintain data integrity and PMBOK compliance.
    * Support a modular architecture for future extensibility and third-party integrations.
    * Deliver comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials and training materials.
    * Achieve 99.9% uptime and sub-second response times for core functionalities.


**3. Project Scope**

**In Scope:**

* Development of core RGA functionalities as detailed in the objectives.
* Creation of a comprehensive suite of user documentation.
* Unit and integration testing to ensure quality and reliability.
* Deployment of the RGA to a production-ready environment.
* Integration with Azure AI services (as specified in dependencies).
* Support for multiple AI providers through a flexible, pluggable architecture.  Initial support will focus on Azure OpenAI and Google Generative AI.

**Out of Scope (for this iteration):**

* Integration with third-party project management tools (future iteration).
* Advanced security features beyond standard security headers and authentication (future iteration).  Note:  A separate security assessment will be conducted post-development.
* Real-time collaboration features (future iteration).
* Support for languages other than English (future iteration).


**4. Deliverables**

* Fully functional Requirements Gathering Agent (version 2.2.0) software package.
* Comprehensive user documentation, including installation guides, tutorials, and API reference.
* Unit and integration test reports.
* Deployment scripts and documentation.
* A documented architecture specification.


**5. Project Timeline**

*(Insert a detailed project schedule here, including milestones and deadlines.  This should be a Gantt chart or a table with specific dates.)*  Example:

| Task                     | Start Date     | End Date       | Duration | Assigned To |
