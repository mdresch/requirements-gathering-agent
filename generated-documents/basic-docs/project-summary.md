# Summaryandgoals

**Project:** ADPA – Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

---

## 1. Project Overview

The Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (ADPA) is a modular, standards-compliant solution for enterprise-scale document generation, project management, and business analysis. Previously known as the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), ADPA leverages the power of AI, industry best practices, and seamless integrations to streamline and automate documentation and governance processes across organizations of any size.

ADPA is developed using modern technologies (Node.js, TypeScript) and supports both CLI and REST API interfaces, making it accessible for developers, business analysts, and enterprise administrators. Its core mission is to enable organizations to efficiently generate, manage, and deliver documentation that aligns with internationally recognized standards—namely BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.

## 2. Key Features

- **Standards Compliance & Framework Coverage**
  - **BABOK v3**: Automated business analysis documentation, including requirements elicitation, stakeholder analysis, solution evaluation, and perspectives.
  - **PMBOK 7th Edition**: Project management outputs such as charters, scope, and stakeholder management plans.
  - **DMBOK 2.0**: Comprehensive data management documents (e.g., governance frameworks, data stewardship, modeling standards, and security/privacy plans).

- **AI-Powered Automation**
  - Multi-provider AI support (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) with intelligent context management and automated document pipelines.
  - Professional, standards-compliant outputs using AI for content generation, analysis, and validation.

- **Enterprise Integrations**
  - **RESTful API** (OpenAPI, TypeSpec), CLI, and web admin portal.
  - Direct publishing to Atlassian Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, and professional PDF generation (Adobe Document Services).
  - Version control and workflow automation integrations (GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps).

- **Security & Compliance**
  - Enterprise-grade authentication (Entra ID/Azure AD), RBAC, and support for regulatory frameworks (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III, MiFID II, FINRA, HIPAA, FedRAMP).
  - Microservices, API-first architecture for scalability and secure deployments.

- **Developer and User Experience**
  - Fast setup via npm, source, or (soon) Docker.
  - CLI with interactive menus and quickstart wizards.
  - Web-based admin interface for non-technical users.
