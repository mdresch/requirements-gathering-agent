## Primary Goals

1. **Automate Standards-Compliant Documentation**
   - Enable rapid, accurate generation of business analysis and project management documents adhering to BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 (in progress).
   - Offer out-of-the-box templates mapped to industry frameworks for consistency and auditability.

2. **Provide Enterprise-Grade Integration**
   - Seamlessly integrate with Atlassian Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, and leading VCS and project management tools.
   - Support production-ready REST APIs (OpenAPI/TypeSpec) and CLI/Web interfaces for flexible enterprise adoption.

3. **Leverage AI for Document Intelligence**
   - Orchestrate multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama, Azure OpenAI) for document creation, context management, and intelligent automation.
   - Support automated workflows, context-aware content generation, and intelligent recommendations.

4. **Ensure Security, Compliance & Scalability**
   - Meet or exceed regulatory requirements (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III, MiFID II, HIPAA, FedRAMP, etc.).
   - Provide robust authentication, authorization, and audit capabilities suitable for Fortune 500 environments.
   - Employ a microservices architecture for horizontal scalability and high availability.

5. **Deliver a Developer- and User-Friendly Platform**
   - Offer a comprehensive CLI and modern Web Admin interface (Next.js/React) for both technical and business users.
   - Ensure extensibility via TypeScript modules, plugin-friendly architecture, and well-documented APIs.
   - Provide clear, actionable setup guides, configuration samples, and usage examples.
