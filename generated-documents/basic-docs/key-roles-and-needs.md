# Key Roles and Needs

**Project:**  Next-Level Banking API Management and Customer Centricity

This document outlines the key roles and their needs for the "Next-Level Banking API Management and Customer Centricity" project, leveraging the `requirements-gathering-agent` tool.  The project aims to create a cutting-edge API management system with enhanced customer centricity, complying with all relevant international legislation.

## I. Key Roles

**A. Project Sponsor:**

* **Role:**  Executive responsible for the project's overall success and funding.  Ultimately approves project decisions and resource allocation.
* **Needs:**  Regular high-level progress reports, assurance of compliance, demonstrable ROI, and a clear understanding of potential risks and mitigation strategies.  Requires reports generated by the `requirements-gathering-agent` tool summarizing project status and compliance adherence.

**B. Product Owner:**

* **Role:** Defines and prioritizes the project's features and functionality.  Acts as the voice of the customer and ensures alignment with business goals.
* **Needs:**  Detailed requirements documentation, user stories, and acceptance criteria.  Requires the `requirements-gathering-agent` to generate PMBOK-compliant documents (stakeholder register, scope management plan, etc.) facilitating communication and alignment with stakeholders.  Needs regular demos to validate progress against the product vision.

**C. Development Team:**

* **Role:** Designs, develops, tests, and deploys the API management system. Includes front-end, back-end, and DevOps engineers.
* **Needs:**  Clear and concise technical specifications, well-defined APIs, access to necessary development tools and environments, and comprehensive test documentation generated by the `requirements-gathering-agent`.  Needs the tool to generate documents that support a modular architecture and allow for easy integration with third-party tools.

**D. Compliance Officer:**

* **Role:** Ensures the project adheres to all relevant legal and regulatory requirements (international banking regulations).
* **Needs:**  Comprehensive compliance documentation, audit trails, and regular reports demonstrating adherence to all relevant banking legislation.  Requires the `requirements-gathering-agent` to generate and maintain this documentation, highlighting any potential compliance gaps.

**E. QA/Testing Team:**

* **Role:**  Tests the system to identify and report defects, ensuring quality and stability.
* **Needs:**  Test plans, test cases, and test data generated by the `requirements-gathering-agent` to automate and streamline the testing process.  Requires access to the tool's output for generating comprehensive test reports and documenting test results.

**F. Operations Team:**

* **Role:**  Manages the deployment and ongoing operation of the API management system.
* **Needs:**  Comprehensive operational documentation, including deployment guides and monitoring procedures.  Requires the `requirements-gathering-agent` to generate and manage this documentation.


## II. Needs Addressed by the `requirements-gathering-agent`

The `requirements-gathering-agent` tool directly addresses the needs of multiple roles by:

* **Automating documentation generation:** Reduces time and effort spent on creating and maintaining documentation.
* **Ensuring PMBOK compliance:** Provides standardized project management documentation.
* **Supporting multiple AI providers:** Offers flexibility and redundancy.
* **Generating validated JSON output:**  Facilitates seamless integration and data exchange.
* **Providing a CLI interface:** Enables easy access and management of configurations.
* **Supporting modular architecture:** Allows for future extensions and integrations.

## III.  Unique Project Needs

This banking project necessitates:

* **Robust security:** The system must meet stringent security standards for protecting sensitive financial data.  While the `requirements-gathering-agent` in its current state doesn't directly address security, its documentation generation capabilities can help in creating security-focused documents.  Further development of the tool to include security features would be beneficial.
* **International compliance:**  The system needs to comply with multiple international banking regulations.  The `requirements-gathering-agent` must be used to meticulously document compliance requirements and track adherence.
* **Scalability and performance:**  The API management system must handle high transaction volumes and maintain optimal performance under peak load.  Performance testing and documentation generated by the tool will be crucial.


This document serves as a starting point and should be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses.  The use of the `requirements-gathering-agent` will be instrumental in managing and documenting these evolving needs.
