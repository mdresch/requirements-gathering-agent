# Key Roles and Needs: Project Backup Vermigerous

**Project:** Project Backup Vermigerous

**Project Goal:** To implement a reliable, automated, and secure monthly backup system for Project Vermigerous, ensuring data recoverability after system failures.  Backups are categorized by year and month.

**Key Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Backup Administrator:** Responsible for the overall management and monitoring of the backup system. This includes:
    * Defining backup schedules and retention policies.
    * Monitoring backup jobs for success or failure.
    * Investigating and resolving backup failures.
    * Performing regular recovery tests.
    * Managing backup storage and ensuring sufficient capacity.
    * Implementing and maintaining security measures for backups (encryption, access control).
    * Updating and maintaining the backup system software and configurations.
    * Reporting on backup system health and performance.


* **System Administrator:** Responsible for the overall health and stability of the systems being backed up. This includes:
    * Ensuring the systems are running smoothly and consistently.
    * Providing access and credentials for the Backup Administrator.
    * Collaborating with the Backup Administrator to schedule backups with minimal disruption.
    * Addressing any system issues that could impact the success of backups.

* **Security Officer (if applicable):** Responsible for reviewing and approving security measures implemented within the backup system. This includes:
    * Reviewing encryption methods and key management strategies.
    * Assessing access control policies for backup data.
    * Auditing backup system logs for security breaches.

* **Development Team (if applicable):** Responsible for developing and maintaining the automation scripts and tools used for backups. This includes:
    * Designing and implementing automated backup scheduling.
    * Developing scripts for incremental/differential backups.
    * Creating validation and integrity checks.
    * Implementing secure storage and encryption.
    * Developing automated recovery testing procedures.
    * Integrating with monitoring and alerting systems.

**Needs:**

* **Automated Backup System:**  A system capable of automatically creating and validating monthly backups.  This system should leverage tools such as cron jobs, Azure Automation, or PowerShell scripts.
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:**  To minimize storage space and backup time.
* **Data Integrity Validation:** Mechanisms to ensure data integrity through checksums (e.g., SHA-256) and post-backup validation.
* **Secure Storage:**  A secure storage solution, such as Azure Blob Storage with a Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy, with encryption at rest and in transit (AES-256 and TLS). Multi-region replication for disaster recovery is highly recommended.
* **Metadata Management:**  A system for automatically tagging backups with metadata (project name, year, month, version) and storing this metadata in a centralized index for easy retrieval.
* **Automated Recovery Testing:**  A regular automated process for testing the recovery of backups in a non-production environment.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:**  A system to monitor backup status and send alerts for failures, delays, or storage threshold breaches (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, or Grafana are suitable options).
* **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation outlining backup procedures, troubleshooting steps, and recovery procedures.
* **Training:** Training for the Backup Administrator on the use and maintenance of the backup system.
* **Sufficient Storage Capacity:**  Enough storage space to accommodate the required number of backups based on the defined retention policy.


**Success Criteria:**

* 100% of monthly backups are successfully created and validated.
* Backup and restoration times meet predefined service level agreements (SLAs).
* Automated recovery tests consistently succeed.
* Backup system monitoring and alerting functions operate effectively.
* All backups are securely stored and protected.
