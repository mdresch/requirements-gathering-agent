# Key Roles and Needs

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

This document outlines the key roles involved in the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project and their corresponding needs.  The project's revolutionary nature necessitates a clear understanding of stakeholder expectations and requirements to ensure successful implementation and adoption.

## Key Roles

This project involves several key stakeholder groups, each with unique needs and responsibilities:

**1. Development Team:**

* **Role:** Responsible for designing, developing, testing, and deploying the ADPA API and associated infrastructure. This includes backend engineers, frontend engineers (if applicable), DevOps engineers, and QA engineers.
* **Needs:** Access to relevant APIs (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), clear technical specifications, well-defined development processes, adequate resources (compute, storage, etc.), comprehensive testing environments, and robust documentation.  They require a stable and well-documented API specification (TypeSpec) for efficient development.

**2. Business Analysts:**

* **Role:** Responsible for defining the business requirements, validating the generated outputs, and ensuring alignment with BABOK v3 methodology.  They will also be instrumental in defining and testing enterprise templates.
* **Needs:**  Access to the API, training on its usage, clear documentation of the BABOK v3 implementation, well-defined templates, mechanisms for feedback and iteration, and confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the generated deliverables.  They require a user-friendly interface for interacting with the API and interpreting the results.

**3. Product Owner/Project Manager:**

* **Role:**  Responsible for defining the project scope, managing the project timeline and budget, and ensuring stakeholder alignment.  They will prioritize features and manage the overall project success.

* **Needs:**  A reliable and scalable API, robust documentation, comprehensive support, demonstrable ROI, and confidence in the security and compliance of the system.  They require a solution that integrates seamlessly into their existing workflows.  The 90% time reduction and Fortune 500 validation are key selling points.

**5. Legal/Compliance Team:**
