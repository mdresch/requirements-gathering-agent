# Developscheduleinput

**Project:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

This document outlines the development schedule input for the ADPA project.  This schedule is a high-level overview and will be refined iteratively through sprint planning.  Specific task durations will be determined during sprint planning, taking into account team capacity and dependencies.

**Project Goals:**

* Complete development of core ADPA functionality (CLI, API, document generation engine).
* Implement integration with at least two AI providers (Google AI and Azure OpenAI).
* Achieve 80% test coverage.
* Release a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

**Phases:**

**Phase 1: Core Functionality Development (8 weeks)**

* **Week 1-2:**  Set up development environment, establish coding standards, and design core architecture.  Implement basic CLI framework and initial API endpoints.
* **Week 3-4:** Develop the document generation engine, focusing on core template processing and output formatting (Markdown, JSON, PDF). Integrate with one AI provider (Google AI).
* **Week 5-6:** Implement remaining API endpoints for document generation, template management, and framework selection (BABOK, PMBOK).  Develop initial unit tests.
* **Week 7-8:** Implement basic authentication and authorization. Integrate with a second AI provider (Azure OpenAI).  Complete initial testing (unit and integration).

**Phase 2: Integration and Testing (4 weeks)**

* **Week 9-10:**  Develop and implement integrations with Confluence and SharePoint (MVP level integration).  Expand unit and integration tests to achieve 80% coverage.
* **Week 11-12:** Perform rigorous system testing, including performance testing and security audits.  Address any identified bugs and vulnerabilities.

**Phase 3: Release and Documentation (2 weeks)**

* **Week 13:** Finalize documentation (README, API specs, user guides). Prepare release artifacts.
* **Week 14:** Release MVP to internal beta testers. Begin gathering feedback and planning for future iterations.


**Milestones:**

* **End of Week 2:** Core architecture and basic CLI/API functionality complete.
* **End of Week 4:** Document generation engine with Google AI integration complete.
* **End of Week 8:** Core functionality complete with initial testing.
* **End of Week 10:**  Confluence and SharePoint integrations complete; 80% test coverage achieved.
* **End of Week 12:**  System testing complete; all critical bugs addressed.
* **End of Week 14:** MVP released to internal beta testers.


**Dependencies:**

* Phase 1 depends on the selection and setup of AI providers.
* Phase 2 depends on the completion of core functionality and initial testing.
* Phase 3 depends on the completion of integration and testing.


**Risks:**

* **AI Provider API Changes:**  Changes to the APIs of the AI providers could impact development timelines.  Mitigation: Monitor API updates and incorporate changes promptly.
* **Integration Challenges:** Unexpected difficulties integrating with Confluence and SharePoint. Mitigation: Allocate extra time for integration testing and troubleshooting.
* **Testing Bottlenecks:**  Insufficient time allocated for thorough testing. Mitigation: Prioritize testing early and allocate adequate resources.


**Assumptions:**

* The development team has the necessary skills and experience.
* All necessary infrastructure and tools are available.
* AI provider APIs remain stable throughout development.


**Contingency Planning:**

* A buffer of one week has been added to each phase to accommodate for unforeseen delays.
* Regular sprint reviews will be used to monitor progress and adjust the schedule as needed.


**This schedule is subject to change based on the progress of development and any unforeseen issues.**  Regular updates will be provided to all stakeholders.
