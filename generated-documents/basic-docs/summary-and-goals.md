## Project Goals

### 1. **Enterprise Standards Compliance**
- **Automate the creation of documentation** fully compliant with:
    - **BABOK v3** (Business Analysis): Elicitation, stakeholder analysis, life cycle management, and more.
    - **PMBOK 7th Edition** (Project Management): Charter, scope, stakeholder, risk, quality, resource, and schedule management.
    - **DMBOK 2.0** (Data Management): Governance, stewardship, modeling, quality, security, metadata, BI, and analytics.
- **Support multi-framework integration** for unified, cross-domain reporting and analysis.

### 2. **AI-Powered Document Generation**
- **Multi-provider AI orchestration** (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama), with automatic failover and provider prioritization.
- **Intelligent context management:** Smart injection of project, organizational, and stakeholder data to ensure relevant and accurate outputs.
- **Advanced prompt engineering** and few-shot learning systems to guarantee high-quality, standards-compliant deliverables for every document type.

### 3. **Enterprise Integration & Automation**
- **Production-ready REST API** (OpenAPI/TypeSpec) and CLI for maximum flexibility.
- **Direct integration** with Atlassian Confluence and Microsoft SharePoint for seamless publishing and document lifecycle management.
- **Professional PDF generation** and document intelligence via Adobe Document Services.
- **Multi-modal interaction:** Support for CLI, web admin interface, and headless API consumption.

### 4. **Compliance, Security & Scalability**
- **Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization**, supporting SSO, OAuth2, and Active Directory.
- **Regulatory compliance** with major standards (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, Basel III, MiFID II, FINRA, and more).
- **Microservices and horizontal scaling:** Designed for large-scale, Fortune 500 deployments with robust performance and reliability.
- **Built-in monitoring, analytics, and health checks** for continuous improvement and proactive issue resolution.
