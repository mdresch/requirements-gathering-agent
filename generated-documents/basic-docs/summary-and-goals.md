## Overview

**ADPA** (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework) is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework purpose-built for AI-driven document generation, project management, and business analysis. Leveraging a modern TypeScript/Node.js stack, ADPA delivers both a robust CLI and a production-ready REST API, supporting professional documentation workflows aligned with globally recognized industry standards: BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0 (in progress).

The framework is designed for secure, scalable, and maintainable automation, backed by enterprise-grade security, microservices architecture, and deep integration with business-critical platforms such as Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services.

## Project Goals

### 1. **Enable Standards-Compliant Documentation Automation**

- Provide out-of-the-box support for major business and project management frameworks:
  - **BABOK v3:** Automate business analysis artifacts and processes.
  - **PMBOK 7th Edition:** Generate comprehensive project management documents.
  - **DMBOK 2.0:** (In progress) Support for data management governance.

- Ensure generated outputs meet regulatory and industry requirements for Fortune 500 organizations:
  - Financial: Basel III, MiFID II, FINRA, CFTC, FCA, BaFin
  - Security: GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001
  - Healthcare and Government: HIPAA, FedRAMP

### 2. **Leverage AI for Intelligent Document Generation**

- Integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama, Azure OpenAI) for flexible, resilient, and context-aware content creation.
- Support intelligent context management for accurate requirements capture and document assembly.
- Automate end-to-end workflows, enabling business users to generate, validate, and publish professional documents with minimal manual intervention.

### 3. **Deliver Enterprise-Ready Integration & Extensibility**

- Offer seamless integration with:
  - **Atlassian Confluence** for collaborative publishing.
  - **Microsoft SharePoint** for enterprise document management.
  - **Adobe Document Services** for high-fidelity PDF and creative outputs.
  - **Version Control Systems:** GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps.
- Provide both CLI and web interfaces for diverse user preferences and enterprise integration scenarios.
- Ensure extensible architecture supporting additional frameworks, providers, and custom workflows.

### 4. **Provide API-First, Secure, and Scalable Architecture**

- REST API designed via TypeSpec, delivering OpenAPI 3.0-compliant, production-hardened endpoints.
- Support scalable deployment models (Docker/Kubernetes ready), horizontal scaling, and robust monitoring/metrics.
- Enforce enterprise-grade authentication, authorization, and regulatory compliance at every layer.

### 5. **Foster Collaboration and Continuous Improvement**

- Enable team-based collaboration via future roadmap features: real-time co-editing, approval workflows, and granular permissioning.
