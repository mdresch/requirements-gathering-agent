# Common Goals User Personas Analysis for the Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (ADPA)

## Project Overview

ADPA is a comprehensive framework for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis, supporting BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.  It offers CLI and REST API interfaces, aiming for enterprise-grade security and scalability.

## Purpose Statement

*As a requirements analyst, I need to understand the common goals of different user personas to effectively align ADPA's features with their needs and maximize user satisfaction.*

## User Persona Overview

We'll analyze the following key user personas, acknowledging that roles may overlap within an organization:

1. **Business Analyst (BA):** Responsible for eliciting, analyzing, and documenting business requirements.  Prioritizes accuracy, completeness, and compliance with BABOK v3.
2. **Project Manager (PM):** Oversees project execution, focusing on timelines, budgets, resources, and risk management (PMBOK 7th Edition). Needs efficient reporting and stakeholder communication.
3. **Data Manager (DM):** Responsible for data governance, quality, and integrity (DMBOK 2.0). Requires tools for data modeling, metadata management, and compliance reporting.
4. **Technical Lead (TL):** Ensures seamless integration with existing systems and oversees the technical implementation of ADPA.  Concerned with API stability, scalability, and security.
5. **Executive Sponsor (ES):**  Requires high-level overviews, key performance indicators (KPIs), and demonstrable ROI.  Focuses on strategic alignment and overall project success.
