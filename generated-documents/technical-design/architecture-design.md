**Version:** 3.2.9  
**Date:** 2025-09-01  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

The ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation) Framework is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation platform that leverages AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis to streamline and automate professional documentation aligned with industry standards such as BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. This document captures the architectural design of ADPA, detailing its component structure, technology stack, integration patterns, security, and scalability considerations to support large-scale enterprise deployments.

- **Scope Boundaries:** 
  - Includes AI-driven document generation pipelines
  - Integration with multiple AI providers with failover
  - Enterprise identity and access management
  - Compliance with multiple standards frameworks
  - Excludes direct AI model training or hosting; relies on external AI services

### 1.2 Stakeholders

- **Primary Users:** Business analysts, project managers, data stewards, and enterprise architects generating documentation.
- **System Administrators:** Responsible for deployment, configuration, and operational monitoring.
- **Developers:** Maintain and extend ADPA modules, integrations, and AI connectors.
