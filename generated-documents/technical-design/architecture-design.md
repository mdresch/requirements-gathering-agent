# Architecture Design Document: Project Backup Vermigerous

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

Project Backup Vermigerous aims to automate and secure the monthly backup process for critical project data. This document outlines the system architecture designed to achieve reliable, automated backups with robust validation and secure recovery capabilities.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, security, and ease of monitoring.

## 2. System Overview

Project Backup Vermigerous automates the monthly backup of project data, ensuring sufficient backups for restoration after system failures. Backups are categorized by year and month. This architecture improves upon existing processes by incorporating automation, robust validation, and secure storage.

## 3. Architectural Principles

* **Automation:**  All backup processes, including scheduling, validation, and (optionally) recovery testing, are automated.
* **Security:** Backups are encrypted both at rest and in transit, stored in immutable storage, and (optionally) replicated across multiple regions.
* **Reliability:**  Data integrity is verified through checksum validation.  Monitoring and alerting mechanisms ensure immediate notification of failures.
* **Maintainability:** The system is designed for ease of maintenance and scalability using modular components.
* **Scalability:** The chosen storage solution (Azure Blob Storage) naturally scales to accommodate growing data volumes.


## 4. System Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following components:

**4.1 Backup Agent:** This component is responsible for performing the actual backup operations.  It will be implemented as a scheduled task (e.g., using cron or Azure Automation) and will utilize efficient backup strategies (incremental or differential).  The agent will:

* Identify data to be backed up (defined configuration).
* Perform the backup operation.
* Generate SHA-256 checksums for data integrity verification.
* Upload the backup to Azure Blob Storage.
* Log all activities to a central log store (e.g., Azure Log Analytics).


**4.2 Azure Blob Storage:** This serves as the secure, immutable storage repository for backups.  We will leverage Azure Blob Storage's Write Once Read Many (WORM) capability to ensure data immutability and prevent accidental deletion or modification of backups.  AES-256 encryption will be used for data at rest.

**4.3 Metadata Service:** A simple database (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB or a lightweight SQL database) will store metadata about each backup, including:

* Project Name
* Backup Date (Year and Month)
* Backup Version (incremental number or timestamp)
* SHA-256 checksum
* Backup Location (Azure Blob Storage URI)


**4.4 Monitoring and Alerting:** Azure Monitor will be integrated to track backup status, storage usage, and other relevant metrics.  Alerts will be configured to notify administrators of failures, delays, or storage threshold breaches.


**4.5 (Optional) Recovery Testing Agent:**  This component (optional, but highly recommended) will periodically perform automated restore tests in a sandbox environment. This verifies the recoverability of backups and identifies potential issues before a real recovery is needed.  Results will be logged and monitored.

                                                                         |
                                                                   +-----------------+
                                                                   |Recovery Testing |
                                                                   |      Agent     |
                                                                   +-----------------+

```

## 5. Technology Stack

* **Backup Agent:** PowerShell (for flexibility and Windows integration), Python (for cross-platform compatibility if needed).
* **Azure Blob Storage:** Azure Blob Storage with WORM enabled.
* **Metadata Service:** Azure Cosmos DB (for scalability and ease of use), or SQL Server (for relational data).
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** Azure Monitor, Log Analytics.
* **(Optional) Recovery Testing Agent:** PowerShell or Python.


## 6. Data Flow

1. The Backup Agent initiates a backup operation at the scheduled time.
2. The Agent performs the backup and generates SHA-256 checksums.
3. The Agent uploads the backup and checksum data to Azure Blob Storage.
4. The Agent sends the backup metadata (including checksum and location) to the Metadata Service.
5. The Metadata Service stores the metadata.
6. Azure Monitor collects metrics and sends alerts based on configured thresholds.
7. (Optional) The Recovery Testing Agent periodically retrieves backups, performs restores in a sandbox, and logs the results.


## 7. Security Considerations

* **Encryption:** AES-256 encryption at rest and TLS for data in transit.
* **Access Control:**  Restrict access to Azure Blob Storage and the Metadata Service using appropriate Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* **Immutability:** Leverage Azure Blob Storage's WORM feature to prevent accidental data deletion or modification.
* **Multi-Region Replication (Optional):**  Consider geographically replicating backups to a secondary Azure region for disaster recovery.


## 8. Deployment and Maintenance

The Backup Agent will be deployed as a scheduled task (cron or Azure Automation). The Metadata Service will be deployed as an Azure service (Cosmos DB or SQL Server).  Monitoring and alerting are configured within the Azure portal.  Updates and maintenance will involve updating the Backup Agent and Metadata Service scripts/applications.

## 9. Future Considerations

* Integration with a centralized logging and monitoring system beyond Azure Monitor.
* Incorporation of more sophisticated backup strategies (e.g., cloud-native backup solutions).
* Implementing automated reporting on backup success and storage usage.


This architecture provides a robust and secure foundation for Project Backup Vermigerous.  The modular design allows for future expansion and adaptation to changing requirements.  The use of Azure services ensures scalability and ease of management.
