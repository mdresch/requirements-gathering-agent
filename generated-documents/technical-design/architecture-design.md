```
                                      +-----------------+
                                      |   Presentation  |  (CLI)
                                      |       Layer      |
                                      +--------+---------+
                                              |
                                              |  REST API
                                              v
                                      +-----------------+
                                      | Application     |
                                      |      Layer      |  (Node.js, TypeScript)
                                      +--------+---------+
                                              |
                                              |  API Calls
                                              v
                                      +-----------------+
                                      |  AI Provider    |
                                      |    Interface    |
                                      +--------+---------+
                                              |
                                              |  AI Provider Calls
                                              v
                                      +-----------------+
                                      |   AI Services   | (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
                                      +-----------------+
```


### 4.1 Presentation Layer

A command-line interface (CLI) built with TypeScript provides user interaction.  It handles user input, configuration management, and displays the generated output.

### 4.2 Application Layer

This layer, implemented using Node.js and TypeScript, acts as the core of the system. It manages:

* **API Routing:** Handling requests from the CLI and directing them to appropriate modules.
* **Business Logic:** Orchestrating the AI provider selection, document generation process, and schema validation.
* **Data Validation:** Ensuring the input data meets the required format and structure.
* **Error Handling:** Managing and reporting errors gracefully.

### 4.3 AI Provider Interface

An abstraction layer isolates the application from specific AI providers.  This allows for easy integration of new providers without modifying core application logic.  It manages:

* **Provider Selection:** Choosing an AI provider based on user configuration or availability.
* **API Calls:** Making requests to the selected AI provider's API.
* **Response Handling:** Processing the responses from the AI providers.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:** Switching to alternative providers if one fails.

### 4.4 AI Services Layer

This layer comprises the various AI services (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) used for document generation.  The choice of provider is configurable.


## 5. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Backend Framework:** Express.js
* **Testing Framework:** Jest
* **AI Providers:** OpenAI API, Google Generative AI API (and others as needed)
* **Database:**  (Optional, for template storage and potentially user data â€“  consider MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
* **Deployment:**  (Consider containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes for scalability)


## 6. Security Architecture

RGA prioritizes security to meet banking industry standards.  Key security considerations include:

* **Authentication:** API keys and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access to the API.
* **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive operations.
* **Data Encryption:** Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
* **Input Validation:** Robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:** Preventing denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  To proactively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance:** Adherence to all relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).


## 7. Deployment Architecture

A cloud-based deployment (e.g., Azure or AWS) is recommended for scalability and reliability.  Containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) are recommended for efficient management and scaling of the application.  A CI/CD pipeline will automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.


## 8. Future Considerations

* **Integration with SharePoint and Confluence:**  Allow users to directly publish generated documents to these platforms.
* **Enhanced Template Management:**  A user interface for creating and managing templates.
* **Advanced AI Capabilities:**  Integration with more sophisticated AI models for improved document quality and analysis.
* **User Authentication and Authorization:**  Implementation of a robust user management system.


## 9. Appendix:  Technology Details

This section would include more detailed specifications for each technology chosen, including versions, configuration details, and relevant documentation links.  This would be expanded upon as the project progresses.


This architecture document provides a high-level overview.  Further details will be elaborated in subsequent design specifications for each component.  The modular design allows for iterative development and adaptation as the project evolves.
