# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant), a revolutionary AI-powered system for generating comprehensive project documentation. ADPA distinguishes itself through its Evaluative Contextual Synthesis and Hierarchical Authority Recognition capabilities, moving beyond simple Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver superior accuracy, consistency, and contextual understanding.  This architecture prioritizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability to support future expansion and integration with various AI providers and enterprise systems.


## 2. System Overview

ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) application built using TypeScript and Node.js. It leverages large language models (LLMs) via a pluggable architecture to generate various document types, including PMBOK-compliant project management documents and specialized technical design documents.  The systemâ€™s core strength lies in its ability to intelligently analyze project context from diverse sources, resolving conflicts and prioritizing information based on relevance and authority.


## 3. Architectural Principles

* **Modularity:**  The system is designed with a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct components.  This promotes code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.  New document types and AI providers can be easily integrated without affecting the core functionality.
* **Extensibility:**  A plugin architecture allows for easy integration of new document types and AI providers.  New processors can be added via configuration without modifying core code.
* **Scalability:**  The system is designed to scale horizontally by utilizing multiple AI providers concurrently and distributing the workload.
* **Reliability:**  Robust error handling and retry mechanisms ensure high availability and fault tolerance.  Fallback mechanisms are in place to handle provider failures.
* **Security:**  Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to protect sensitive project data.  Integration with enterprise identity providers (e.g., Azure AD) is supported.
* **Maintainability:**  The codebase adheres to coding best practices, including comprehensive unit testing and clear documentation.


## 4. System Architecture

ADPA employs a layered architecture:

**Layer 1: CLI Interface:**  Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the system.  This layer handles user input, parses commands, and manages configuration options.

**Layer 2: Core Engine:** This layer orchestrates the entire document generation process.  It includes:

* **Context Manager:**  This crucial component performs comprehensive project analysis, intelligently discovers and scores relevant documents, and builds a prioritized context for the LLM. It utilizes a three-phase strategy to optimize context usage for different AI models.
* **Processor Factory:**  A factory pattern is used to dynamically instantiate document processors based on user input and configuration. Each processor is responsible for generating a specific document type (e.g., Project Charter, API Documentation, Architecture Design).
* **AI Provider Interface:**  An abstraction layer provides a consistent interface for interacting with various AI providers (currently supports Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama). This allows seamless switching between providers.
* **Validation Engine:**  This component validates generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards and other relevant compliance frameworks, providing quality scores and actionable recommendations.
* **Version Control System:**  (Optional) Integrates with a local Git repository to track changes to generated documents, providing version history and diffs.

**Layer 3: Document Processors:**  These are pluggable modules, each responsible for generating a specific document type.  Each processor uses specialized AI prompts and templates to optimize content generation for its specific domain.

**Layer 4: AI Providers:**  This layer represents the external AI services (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) used for document generation and analysis.


## 5. Component Details

**5.1 CLI Interface (`cli.ts`, `cli-main.ts`):**  Built using Node.js and a command-line parsing library (e.g., `commander.js` or `yargs`).  Handles user input, manages configuration, and interacts with the core engine.

**5.2 Context Manager (`contextManager.ts`):**  This component employs several sub-components:

* **File Analyzer:**  Recursively searches project directories for relevant documentation files, applying scoring heuristics based on content relevance, file location, naming patterns, and content structure.
* **Relevance Scorer:**  Assigns a relevance score (0-100) to each discovered file based on its potential contribution to the context.
* **Context Builder:**  Combines the prioritized context into a format suitable for the chosen LLM, employing different strategies based on the LLM's context window size.
* **Conflict Resolver:**  Intelligent conflict resolution mechanisms to handle contradictory information found across multiple documents.

**5.3 Processor Factory (`processorFactory.ts`):**  This module dynamically instantiates document processors based on configuration in `processor-config.json`.

**5.4 Document Processors (e.g., `projectCharterProcessor.ts`, `apiDocumentationProcessor.ts`):** Each processor is responsible for generating a specific document type.  They use specialized AI prompts, templates, and validation rules.

**5.5 AI Provider Interface (`aiProviderInterface.ts`):**  This interface defines a common set of methods for interacting with different AI providers.  Concrete implementations (e.g., `azureOpenAIProvider.ts`, `googleAIProvider.ts`) handle the specifics of each provider.

**5.6 Validation Engine (`validationEngine.ts`):**  Performs PMBOK 7.0 compliance checks, document structure validation, and terminology consistency checks. Provides detailed quality reports.

**5.7 Version Control System (VCS):**  (Optional module) Integrates with Git to provide version control for generated documents.


## 6. Technology Stack

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Framework:**  None (Modular architecture)
* **Database:**  None (Data is primarily handled in memory)
* **Testing:** Jest
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama (pluggable)


## 7. Data Flow

1. **User Input:** The user provides commands via the CLI.
2. **Command Parsing:** The CLI parses the command and extracts relevant parameters.
3. **Project Analysis:** The Context Manager analyzes the project, discovering and scoring relevant documents.
4. **Context Building:** The Context Manager builds a prioritized context for the chosen LLM.
5. **Processor Selection:** The Processor Factory instantiates the appropriate document processor.
6. **AI Interaction:** The processor sends the context and a specialized prompt to the AI provider.
7. **Document Generation:** The AI provider generates the document content.
8. **Validation:** The Validation Engine checks the generated document for compliance and quality.
9. **Output:** The generated document is written to the specified output directory.
10. **Version Control (Optional):** Changes are committed to the local Git repository.


## 8. Deployment Architecture

ADPA is designed to be deployed as a standalone CLI application.  It can be installed globally using npm or run directly with `npx`.  No server-side components are required.


## 9. Future Considerations

* **Enhanced Context Management:** Explore more sophisticated context management techniques, including advanced summarization and semantic search.
* **Improved Conflict Resolution:** Develop more robust methods for handling conflicting information from multiple sources.
* **Integration with PM Tools:** Integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps) to streamline workflows.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Extend support for generating documents in multiple languages.
* **Visual Interface:**  Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for improved user experience.


## 10. Conclusion

The ADPA architecture is designed for flexibility, scalability, and maintainability.  Its modular design and support for multiple AI providers enable it to adapt to evolving project needs and technological advancements. The focus on intelligent context management and validation ensures high-quality, accurate, and consistent project documentation.
