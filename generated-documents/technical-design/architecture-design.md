**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-23
**Status:** Final

## 1. Executive Summary

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary platform automating the generation of enterprise-grade business analysis frameworks, significantly reducing time and effort while maintaining Fortune 500 quality and 100% BABOK v3 compliance.  This document details the system architecture, encompassing its API-first design, multi-provider AI integration, robust security features, and scalable infrastructure.  The platform's core innovation lies in its ability to produce comprehensive, compliant documentation in seconds, transforming the business analysis landscape.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Purpose and Scope

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent aims to automate the traditionally time-consuming and labor-intensive process of requirements elicitation and framework generation for large-scale enterprise projects.  It achieves this by leveraging advanced AI models and a sophisticated template engine to produce BABOK v3 compliant documents, stakeholder analyses, and regulatory compliance summaries. The system's scope includes the design, development, and deployment of a production-ready RESTful API, supporting various AI providers and offering multi-format output (e.g., Markdown, PDF, DOCX).

* **Extensibility:**  Support for multiple AI providers and custom templates ensures flexibility and future-proofing.


## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 High-Level Architecture

The system adopts a layered architecture:

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
| Presentation    | <--> | Application     | <--> | Business Logic  | <--> | Data Access     |
| Layer (API)     |     | Layer           |     | Layer           |     | Layer           |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
                                                                        |
                                                                        v
                                                                    +-----------------+
                                                                    | Data Storage    |
                                                                    | (Database/File) |
                                                                    +-----------------+
```

**Presentation Layer:**  RESTful API built with Express.js and TypeScript, handling requests and responses.  Utilizes TypeSpec for API definition and OpenAPI 3.0 specification generation.

**Application Layer:**  Manages API requests, orchestrates business logic, and handles authentication and authorization.

**Business Logic Layer:**  Contains core functionality, including template processing, AI interaction, and document generation.  This layer is designed for modularity and extensibility.

**Data Access Layer:**  Abstraction layer for interacting with data storage, providing a consistent interface regardless of the underlying storage mechanism.

**Data Storage Layer:**  Persists generated documents, templates, and system configuration data.  This could be a file system or a database (e.g., PostgreSQL).


### 4.2 Component Details

**API Gateway:**  Handles routing, authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.  Uses Express.js middleware for these functions.

**Authentication Service:** Manages API key authentication and potentially JWT-based authentication for enhanced security.

**AI Provider Interface:**  Abstracts interactions with different AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), providing a consistent interface for the business logic layer.

**Document Generation Engine:** Core component responsible for processing templates, interacting with AI providers, and generating documents in various formats.  Uses a template engine (e.g., Handlebars, Mustache) and libraries for document conversion (e.g., LibreOffice).

**Template Management Service:** Manages the lifecycle of document templates, allowing users to create, update, and delete custom templates.

**Job Management Service:**  Handles asynchronous document generation tasks, providing real-time status updates.

**Logging and Monitoring:**  Comprehensive logging and monitoring are integrated throughout the system using Winston and potentially other monitoring tools.


## 5. Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
* **API Definition:** TypeSpec
* **API Specification:** OpenAPI 3.0
* **Database:** (Optional) PostgreSQL or similar
* **AI Providers:** OpenAI API, Google AI Platform, GitHub Copilot (optional)
* **Template Engine:**  Handlebars or similar
* **Document Conversion:** LibreOffice or similar
* **Authentication:** API Keys, JWT (optional)
* **Logging:** Winston

## 6. Data Model

The data model includes:

* **Users:**  Stores user information (if implemented).
* **Templates:**  Stores document templates, including their name, description, category, tags, and template data.
* **Jobs:**  Tracks asynchronous document generation jobs, including status, progress, and results.
* **Documents:**  Stores generated documents (potentially in a database or file system).


## 7. Security Architecture

The system incorporates several security measures:

* **API Key Authentication:**  Requires an API key for all requests.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Input Validation:**  Uses Zod schemas to validate all incoming requests.
* **Authorization (Future Enhancement):**  Role-based access control could be added for finer-grained control.
* **HTTPS:**  All communication uses HTTPS for encryption.
* **Secure Storage of API Keys and Sensitive Data:**  Appropriate strategies for secure storage (e.g., Azure Key Vault) are required.


## 8. Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps).  A containerization strategy (Docker and Kubernetes) is recommended for scalability and portability.  Monitoring and logging will be implemented using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.


## 9. Scalability and Performance

Scalability is achieved through horizontal scaling using container orchestration (Kubernetes).  Performance optimization will involve techniques like caching, database optimization, and code profiling.


## 10. Future Considerations

* **Integration with other project management tools:**  Extend the platform to seamlessly integrate with popular project management software.
* **Support for additional standards:**  Expand to support other industry standards beyond BABOK v3.
* **Enhanced user interface:** Develop a user-friendly web interface for easier interaction.
* **Advanced analytics and reporting:**  Provide insights into usage patterns and document generation statistics.
