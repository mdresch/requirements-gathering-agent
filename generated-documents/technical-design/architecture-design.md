# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI-Generated (Based on provided README and documentation)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent. ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context extracted from various sources, primarily README files and associated project documentation.  The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and extensibility, supporting multiple AI providers and a modular architecture for adding new document types.

## 2. System Goals and Objectives

ADPA aims to:

* **Automate Project Documentation:** Reduce manual effort in creating project documentation.
* **Ensure PMBOK Compliance:** Generate documents adhering to Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) 7.0 standards.
* **Improve Documentation Quality:** Produce accurate, consistent, and comprehensive documentation.
* **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Offer flexibility in choosing AI models and services.
* **Enable Extensibility:** Easily add new document types and features.
* **Provide User-Friendly Interface:** Offer a simple and intuitive CLI for interaction.


## 3. High-Level Architecture

ADPA employs a layered architecture, separating concerns into distinct modules:

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|  CLI Interface  | --> |  Context Manager | --> | Document Engine  | --> | Output Manager  |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
      ^                                                                         |
      |                                                                         v
      +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------+
                                                                               |  AI Provider(s) |
                                                                               +-----------------+
```

**1. CLI Interface:** This layer provides the user interface, handling command parsing, argument validation, and interaction with the Context Manager.  It uses Node.js and TypeScript.

**2. Context Manager:** This core module is responsible for gathering, processing, and organizing project context. It discovers and analyzes project files, scores their relevance, and prepares the context for the Document Engine. It utilizes sophisticated techniques for large context handling and incorporates a 3-phase context strategy to optimize for different AI model capabilities.  This module uses TypeScript.  It includes:

    * **Project Analyzer:** Recursively searches project directories for relevant markdown files, scoring them based on content relevance, file location, naming patterns, structure, and depth.
    * **Context Builder:** Integrates information from multiple files, prioritizing high-scoring sources and balancing context size to avoid token overflow.
    * **Context Manager:** Manages the context across multiple phases (Core, Ultra-Large Model, Large Model Supplementary), adapting the strategy based on the chosen AI provider and model.

**3. Document Engine:**  This module utilizes the prepared context from the Context Manager and the selected AI provider to generate project management documentation. It employs a modular processor architecture, allowing for easy addition of new document types.  This module uses TypeScript. It includes:

    * **Processor Factory:** Dynamically loads and instantiates document processors based on configuration.
    * **Document Processors:** Individual modules responsible for generating specific document types (e.g., Project Charter, Risk Register, Architecture Design). Each processor uses specialized AI prompts optimized for its document type.
    * **Template Engine:**  Applies professional markdown templates to ensure consistent formatting and structure.
    * **PMBOK Validator:** Checks generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards and provides quality scores.

**4. Output Manager:** This layer handles the writing and version control of generated documents. It manages the output directory structure, automatically commits changes to a local Git repository (if enabled), and provides CLI commands for managing the VCS.  This layer uses Node.js, TypeScript, and a Git library.


**AI Provider(s):**  ADPA supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) through an abstraction layer. This allows for flexibility and redundancy.  The choice of provider is configurable via the CLI or a `.env` file.


## 4. Component Details

### 4.1 CLI Interface (cli.ts, cli-main.ts)

* **Technology:** Node.js, TypeScript, Commander.js (or similar CLI framework)
* **Functionality:** Parses command-line arguments, validates input, interacts with the Context Manager, handles output, and manages the VCS.
* **Key Features:**  Supports various options like `--generate-technical`, `--validate-pmbok`, `--core-only`,  VCS commands (`vcs log`, `vcs diff`, etc.), and configuration options.

### 4.2 Context Manager (contextManager.ts)

* **Technology:** TypeScript
* **Functionality:**  Manages the three phases of context building and injection into the LLM.  Performs project analysis, relevance scoring, and context integration.
* **Key Features:**  Recursive directory traversal, smart relevance scoring, automatic categorization, 3-phase context strategy, model-specific optimization, and reporting.

### 4.3 Document Engine (llmProcessor.ts, ProcessorFactory.ts, individual document processors)

* **Technology:** TypeScript
* **Functionality:**  Generates documents using the selected AI provider and context.  Uses a modular architecture with dedicated processors for each document type.
* **Key Features:**  Modular processor architecture, specialized AI prompts, professional templates, PMBOK validation, and error handling.

### 4.4 Output Manager (outputManager.ts)

* **Technology:** Node.js, TypeScript, NodeGit (or similar Git library)
* **Functionality:** Manages the output directory structure, handles file writing, and manages version control.
* **Key Features:**  Automatic versioning, history tracking, diff viewing, revert capabilities, remote repository synchronization (optional), and CLI VCS commands.


## 5. Data Flow

1. The CLI Interface receives user commands and passes them to the Context Manager.
2. The Context Manager performs project analysis, scoring, and context building.
3. The Context Manager passes the prepared context to the Document Engine.
4. The Document Engine uses the context and the selected AI provider to generate documents via the appropriate processors.
5. The Document Engine passes the generated documents to the Output Manager.
6. The Output Manager writes the documents to the specified output directory and manages version control (if enabled).


## 6. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
* **CLI Framework:** Commander.js (or similar)
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama (with abstraction layer)
* **Git Library:** NodeGit (or similar)
* **Testing Framework:** Jest


## 7. Deployment Architecture

ADPA is designed to be deployed as a command-line tool.  No server-side components are required.  The deployment process involves building the application and distributing the executable file.


## 8. Future Considerations

* **Improved Context Management:** Explore more advanced context management techniques, such as embeddings and vector databases.
* **Enhanced AI Capabilities:**  Integrate with newer and more powerful LLMs.
* **GUI Development:**  Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction.
* **Integration with PM Tools:** Integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Multi-Lingual Support:**  Add support for multiple languages.
