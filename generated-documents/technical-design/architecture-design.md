# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent. ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context extracted from various sources, primarily the project's README file and associated documentation.  The system's key differentiator is its comprehensive project analysis, enhanced context management, and support for multiple AI providers, enabling highly accurate and contextually relevant document generation.  This architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability to accommodate future expansion and integration with third-party tools.


## 2. System Overview

ADPA's primary function is to automate the creation of project management documents conforming to PMBOK 7.0 standards. It achieves this by:

1. **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Intelligently discovers and analyzes all relevant project documentation, including README files, requirements specifications, architecture diagrams, and stakeholder information.  This goes beyond simple keyword matching, employing sophisticated techniques to assess content relevance and structure.

2. **Enhanced Context Management:**  A three-phase context management strategy optimizes context delivery to large language models (LLMs), maximizing the utilization of available tokens and improving the accuracy and coherence of generated documents.  This system adapts to the capabilities of different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini).

3. **AI-Powered Document Generation:** Employs multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) via a flexible abstraction layer.  Specialized AI prompts are used for each document type to ensure optimal content generation.

4. **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance and Validation:**  Generates documents according to PMBOK 7.0 standards and includes a validation framework to assess document completeness, consistency, and adherence to best practices.

5. **Modular Architecture:**  Utilizes a modular processor architecture, allowing for easy expansion with new document types and AI providers.


## 3. Architectural Principles

The ADPA architecture is guided by the following principles:

* **Modularity:** The system is composed of loosely coupled, independent modules (processors) for each document type and AI provider.  This enhances maintainability, testability, and extensibility.

* **Scalability:** Designed to handle large projects with extensive documentation and high numbers of concurrent users.  This is achieved through efficient context management, asynchronous processing, and support for horizontal scaling.

* **Reliability:**  Includes robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies to ensure high availability and prevent failures from cascading.

* **Maintainability:**  The codebase is written in TypeScript, promoting type safety and code clarity.  Comprehensive unit and integration tests are implemented to facilitate code changes and ensure stability.

* **Extensibility:** The modular design and abstraction layers make it easy to add new document types, AI providers, and integrations.

* **Security:**  Securely handles API keys and authentication tokens using environment variables and best practices for sensitive data handling.


## 4. System Architecture

ADPA employs a layered architecture:

**Layer 1: CLI Interface:**  Provides a command-line interface for user interaction, allowing users to specify document types, AI providers, and other options.  This layer handles input validation and manages the overall workflow.

**Layer 2: Core Logic:**  This layer contains the central components:

* **Project Analyzer:**  Responsible for discovering, analyzing, and scoring relevant project documentation.
* **Context Manager:** Implements the three-phase context management strategy, optimizing context delivery to the LLMs.
* **Processor Factory:**  A factory pattern that dynamically creates and manages document processors based on configuration.
* **AI Provider Interface:**  An abstraction layer that provides a consistent interface for interacting with different AI providers.
* **Document Validator:**  Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards and provides quality assessment scores.
* **Version Control System (VCS):** Manages version history for generated documents using a local Git repository.

**Layer 3: Document Processors:**  Each document type (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Architecture Design) has a dedicated processor. These processors use specialized AI prompts and templates to generate the respective documents.

**Layer 4: AI Providers:**  This layer interacts with the chosen AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) to generate text based on the provided context and prompts.


## 5. Component Details

### 5.1 Project Analyzer

* **Technology:** TypeScript, Node.js, regular expressions, file system access.
* **Responsibilities:**  Recursively scans project directories, identifies relevant files, extracts content, analyzes content relevance and structure, and assigns relevance scores (0-100).
* **Data Output:**  A structured representation of discovered documents, including file paths, content, relevance scores, and categorization.

### 5.2 Context Manager

* **Technology:** TypeScript, data structures (maps, sets).
* **Responsibilities:**  Implements the three-phase context strategy, selecting and preparing context for LLMs based on model capabilities and available tokens.  Handles token optimization and buffer management.
* **Data Output:**  Prepared context string for AI provider.

### 5.3 Processor Factory

* **Technology:** TypeScript, factory pattern, dynamic imports.
* **Responsibilities:**  Instantiates document processors based on configuration ( `processor-config.json` ).  Handles error conditions gracefully.
* **Data Output:**  Instantiated document processor object.

### 5.4 AI Provider Interface

* **Technology:** TypeScript, interface definition.
* **Responsibilities:**  Defines a common interface for interacting with different AI providers, abstracting away provider-specific details.
* **Data Output:**  Generated text from the LLM.

### 5.5 Document Processors (Example: Project Charter Processor)

* **Technology:** TypeScript, LLM interaction, PMBOK template.
* **Responsibilities:**  Generates a Project Charter document using the provided context and a PMBOK-compliant template.  Includes error handling and quality checks.
* **Data Output:**  Generated Project Charter document.

### 5.6 Document Validator

* **Technology:** TypeScript, PMBOK schema validation, quality assessment algorithms.
* **Responsibilities:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards and provides a detailed quality assessment report, including scores and recommendations.
* **Data Output:** Validation report with scores and recommendations.


## 6. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
* **Testing Framework:** Jest
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama (configurable)
* **Package Manager:** npm


## 7. Deployment Architecture

ADPA is designed for deployment as a command-line tool.  The primary deployment method is via npm, making it easily installable globally or locally.  The modular architecture allows for easy updates and integration with CI/CD pipelines.


## 8. Future Considerations

* **Enhanced Contextual Understanding:**  Explore techniques to further improve the system's ability to understand complex relationships and nuances within project documentation.
* **Improved Validation:**  Extend the validation framework to incorporate more sophisticated checks and provide more detailed feedback.
* **Integration with PM Tools:**  Integrate with popular project management tools (Jira, Asana, etc.) to streamline workflows.
* **Visual Interface:**  Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
* **Multi-lingual Support:** Extend support for multiple languages.


This architecture document provides a high-level overview of the ADPA system.  Further detailed design specifications will be provided for individual components as the project progresses.
