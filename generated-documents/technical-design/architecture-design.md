# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Authors:** AI-assisted, based on project README and provided documentation.


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architecture of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent. ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI to generate comprehensive project documentation, aligning with PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Its key differentiator is the incorporation of a sophisticated context management system that significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of the generated documents by utilizing a wider range of project information beyond just the README.  This architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability to support future expansion and integration with third-party tools.


## 2. System Overview

ADPA's primary function is to automate the creation of various project management documents, including strategic statements, technical design documents, and a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-aligned artifacts. The system achieves this through a three-stage process:

1. **Project Analysis:**  ADPA analyzes all relevant project markdown files (README.md and beyond) to build a rich context model.  This includes intelligent source discovery, relevance scoring, and automatic categorization of documentation.

2. **Context Management:** An enhanced context manager intelligently manages and optimizes the project context for different AI models, using a three-phase strategy to maximize token utilization. This ensures that the AI receives the most relevant information possible without exceeding token limits.

3. **Document Generation:**  A modular document generation engine employs specialized AI prompts and professional templates for each document type. This engine leverages the enriched context from the context manager to produce high-quality, accurate, and PMBOK-compliant documents.  The engine also includes built-in validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards and a quality assessment feature.


## 3. Architectural Principles

* **Modularity:** ADPA is designed with a modular architecture, employing a processor factory pattern. This allows for easy addition, removal, or modification of document generation processors without impacting the core functionality. Each document type (e.g., Project Charter, Architecture Design, API Documentation) is handled by a separate, independent processor.

* **Extensibility:** The modular design allows for seamless integration of new document types and AI providers. Adding a new document type only requires creating a new processor and registering it in the configuration.

* **Scalability:**  The system is designed to scale horizontally by leveraging cloud-based AI services.  The context management system is optimized to handle large projects and extensive documentation.

* **Maintainability:**  The use of TypeScript, comprehensive unit testing (Jest), and clear code structure promotes maintainability and reduces technical debt.

* **Reliability:**  The system incorporates robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and fallback strategies to ensure reliable document generation even in the event of API failures or unexpected inputs.  The multi-provider support provides redundancy.

* **Security:**  Secure integration with AI providers is achieved using appropriate authentication methods (API keys, Entra ID for Azure, Google AI Studio API keys, GitHub tokens, etc.), depending on the chosen provider.


## 4. System Architecture

ADPA's architecture can be represented as a layered system:

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
|  CLI Interface   |---->|  Processor Factory|---->| Document Processor |---->| AI Provider     |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
       ^                                                                        |
       |                                                                        v
       +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                       |
                                       v
                               +-----------------+
                               | Context Manager |
                               +-----------------+
                                       |
                                       v
                               +-----------------+
                               | Project Analyzer|
                               +-----------------+
```

**Components:**

* **CLI Interface:**  Provides command-line access to ADPA's functionalities, allowing users to generate documents, manage configurations, and access version control features.  It handles user input, option parsing, and output formatting.  Written in TypeScript.

* **Project Analyzer:** This component scans the project directory, identifies relevant markdown files, analyzes their content, and assigns relevance scores based on PMBOK keywords and context.  It uses regular expressions and heuristics to identify key file types and locations.  Written in TypeScript.

* **Context Manager:**  This core component is responsible for building and managing the project context for the AI models.  It employs a three-phase strategy (Core, Ultra-Large Model, Large Model Supplementary) to optimize context size for different model capabilities.  It prioritizes relevant files and handles token limits intelligently. Written in TypeScript.

* **Processor Factory:** A factory pattern that instantiates the appropriate document processor based on the user's request (via CLI arguments).  Handles loading and configuration of processors. Written in TypeScript.

* **Document Processors:**  These modular components handle the actual generation of individual document types. Each processor uses specialized AI prompts and templates to generate content.  Each processor is responsible for formatting and validation of its output.  Written in TypeScript.

* **AI Provider:** This layer abstracts the interaction with different AI services (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  It handles API requests, error handling, and response parsing.  Written in TypeScript with an abstract base class for provider-specific implementations.


## 5. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
* **Testing Framework:** Jest
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama (configurable via `.env`)
* **Package Manager:** npm
* **Version Control:** Git (integrated VCS)


## 6. Data Flow

1. The CLI Interface receives user input specifying the desired document(s) to generate.
2. The CLI Interface passes the request to the Processor Factory.
3. The Processor Factory instantiates the appropriate Document Processor.
4. The Document Processor requests context from the Context Manager.
5. The Context Manager retrieves, prioritizes, and prepares the project context, using the Project Analyzer's results.
6. The Context Manager sends the prepared context to the Document Processor.
7. The Document Processor sends the context and relevant prompts to the AI Provider.
8. The AI Provider returns the generated content.
9. The Document Processor processes the AI's response, formats the output, performs validation, and writes the document to the designated output directory.
10. The CLI Interface provides feedback to the user.


## 7. Deployment Architecture

ADPA is designed to be deployed as a command-line tool.  The primary deployment method is through npm.  The source code is managed using Git, and a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline could be implemented to automate the build, testing, and deployment process to npm.


## 8. Future Considerations

* **Enhanced Context Analysis:**  Investigate more sophisticated natural language processing techniques to improve the accuracy of relevance scoring and context building.
* **Improved AI Model Selection:** Develop a more intelligent system for dynamically selecting the optimal AI model based on the complexity of the requested document and the available project context.
* **Visualization Tools:**  Explore adding visualization capabilities to better represent project information and generated documents.
* **Integration with Project Management Tools:**  Integrate with popular project management platforms (Jira, Asana, etc.) to provide seamless data transfer and workflow automation.
* **Support for Additional File Types:** Extend the Project Analyzer to support additional file types beyond markdown (e.g., diagrams, spreadsheets).
