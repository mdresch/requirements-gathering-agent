# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

ADPA is a modular, scalable, and secure framework for AI-powered document generation and automation, adhering to industry standards like BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.  This document details ADPA's architecture, encompassing its core components, technology stack, data flow, security considerations, and deployment strategy.  The system is designed for enterprise-level deployments, prioritizing reliability, maintainability, and extensibility.  A key differentiator is its multi-provider AI support, enabling flexibility and resilience.


## 2. System Overview

ADPA streamlines document creation and project management processes through AI-driven automation.  It targets business analysts, project managers, and data stewards within large organizations needing standardized, compliant documentation.  The system offers a command-line interface (CLI) for straightforward tasks and a RESTful API for seamless integration into existing workflows.  A web-based administration interface provides centralized management and monitoring capabilities.


## 3. Architectural Principles

ADPA's architecture is guided by the following principles:

* **Microservices:**  The system is designed as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable microservices, enhancing scalability, maintainability, and fault isolation.
* **API-First:**  The REST API serves as the primary interface, allowing for flexible integration with various systems.  TypeSpec is used for OpenAPI specification generation.
* **Multi-Provider AI Support:**  Abstraction of AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama) allows for flexibility, redundancy, and cost optimization.
* **Data-Driven:**  Configuration and document generation are heavily reliant on configurable data models and templates, ensuring flexibility and customization.
* **Security:**  Robust security measures, including authentication (Microsoft Entra ID integration planned), authorization (RBAC), and encryption, are implemented to protect sensitive data and comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.).


## 4. System Architecture

ADPA employs a layered architecture:

**Layer 1: Presentation Layer:**  This layer comprises the CLI, the web-based admin interface (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS), and any future client applications (e.g., mobile app).

**Layer 2: API Gateway:** This layer acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests to appropriate microservices and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and rate limiting.

**Layer 3: Microservices:**  This layer consists of independent services, each responsible for a specific function:

* **AI Processing Engine:** Orchestrates requests to different AI providers, manages context, and handles responses.
* **Document Generator:**  Generates documents using templates and AI-generated content.  Handles different output formats (Markdown, JSON, PDF via Adobe Document Services integration).
* **Framework Engine:**  Handles framework-specific logic for BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0.  Provides template management and validation.
* **Integration Services:**  Manage interactions with external systems like Confluence and SharePoint (OAuth2 integration).  Includes version control system (VCS) integration.
* **Authentication Service:**  Handles user authentication and authorization (planned Microsoft Entra ID integration).
* **Analytics & Reporting Service:** Collects usage metrics and generates reports.


**Layer 4: Data Layer:**  This layer consists of a persistent data store (initially JSON-based configuration, extensible to SQL/NoSQL) and a caching layer (Redis planned for performance optimization).


## 5. Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js 18+, TypeScript, Express.js
* **AI Integration:** OpenAI API, Google Generative AI API, GitHub Copilot API, Ollama API
* **API Specification:** TypeSpec, OpenAPI 3.0
* **Frontend (Admin Interface):** Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
* **Database:**  Initially JSON configuration files; future scalability with PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
* **Caching:**  Redis (planned)
* **Testing:** Jest, TypeScript
* **Authentication:** JWT (initially); Microsoft Entra ID (planned)
* **Deployment:**  Initially self-hosted; Docker and Kubernetes deployment planned.


## 6. Data Flow

1. A request (via CLI or API) is received.
2. The API Gateway validates authentication and authorization.
3. The request is routed to the appropriate microservice.
4. The microservice interacts with the AI Processing Engine if necessary.
5. The AI Processing Engine interacts with the chosen AI provider.
6. The generated content is passed to the Document Generator.
7. The Document Generator creates the document in the specified format.
8. The Integration Services handle publishing or storage as required.
9. Analytics & Reporting Service collects usage data.


## 7. Security Architecture

ADPA prioritizes security through:

* **Authentication:**  Initially JWT-based; future implementation with Microsoft Entra ID for robust SSO and centralized identity management.
* **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
* **Data Protection:**  Data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* **Input Validation:**  Strict input validation to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:**  To prevent denial-of-service attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  To identify and address vulnerabilities.


## 8. Deployment Architecture

ADPA will initially support self-hosted deployments.  Future roadmap items include:

* **Docker Containerization:**  Packaging the application into Docker containers for easier deployment and portability.
* **Kubernetes Deployment:**  Deploying the microservices on Kubernetes for scalability and high availability.
* **Cloud Deployment Options:**  Support for deployment on major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).


## 9. Scalability and Performance

Scalability is achieved through the microservices architecture.  Horizontal scaling is facilitated by deploying multiple instances of each microservice.  The Redis caching layer will improve performance by reducing database load.  Load balancing will distribute traffic across microservice instances.  Performance monitoring and optimization will be ongoing.


## 10. Future Considerations

* **Integration with additional project management and document management systems.**
* **Enhanced AI capabilities, including natural language processing and machine learning for improved document generation.**
* **Advanced workflow automation features.**
* **Real-time collaboration features.**
* **Mobile application support.**
