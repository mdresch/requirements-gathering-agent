# ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API Documentation

## 1. API Overview

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API is a production-ready RESTful service built using Express.js and TypeScript.  It leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks, stakeholder ecosystem maps, and regulatory compliance documentation in seconds.  The API is designed for enterprise-level scalability and security, featuring authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling.  It adheres to API-first principles, with a complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification available.

## 2. Authentication Methods

The API uses API key authentication.  Clients must include a valid API key in the `X-API-Key` header with each request.  API keys are managed through the application's administrative interface (not exposed through this API).

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/v1/health -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 3. Endpoint Definitions

The API exposes the following endpoints:


### 3.1 Document Generation API

| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                                                                  | Request Body                               | Response Body                                    | Error Codes                                     |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| POST    | `/api/v1/documents/convert` | Generate a BABOK framework document.                                      | JSON object containing input data (see below) | JSON object containing job ID and status        | 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), 500 (Internal Server Error) |
| GET     | `/api/v1/documents/jobs`   | Retrieve a list of document generation jobs.                              | None                                         | JSON array of job objects                       | 401 (Unauthorized), 500 (Internal Server Error) |
| GET     | `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status` | Retrieve the status of a specific document generation job. | None                                         | JSON object containing job status and progress  | 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error) |
| GET     | `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}` | Download a generated document.                                           | None                                         | The generated document                          | 401 (Unauthorized), 404 (Not Found), 500 (Internal Server Error) |


**Request Body for `/api/v1/documents/convert`:**

The structure of the request body depends on the type of document being generated.  A sample for generating a BABOK framework based on a Fortune 500 Global Bank scenario might look like this:

```json
{
  "projectName": "GlobalBank Modernization Program",
  "stakeholders": [
    {"name": "CEO", "role": "Executive Sponsor"},
    {"name": "CTO", "role": "Technical Lead"}
    // ... more stakeholders
  ],
  "regulatoryCompliance": ["Basel III", "MiFID II", "GDPR"],
  // ... other relevant project details
}
```

**Response Body Examples:**

**Job Status:**

```json
{
  "jobId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef",
  "status": "in progress",
  "progress": 75,
  "estimatedCompletionTime": "2025-06-22T14:00:00Z"
}
```

**Error Response:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 400,
    "message": "Invalid request body: Missing required field 'projectName'",
    "details": [
      {"field": "projectName", "message": "This field is required"}
    ]
  }
}
```


### 3.2 Template Management API (Optional - Future Enhancement)

This section will be populated once template management functionality is implemented.


## 4. Request/Response Formats

All requests and responses use JSON (application/json).


## 5. Error Codes

| Code | Description                                      |
|------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request: Invalid request data.                |
| 401  | Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key.        |
| 404  | Not Found: Requested resource not found.          |
| 500  | Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred.|


## 6. Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.  The specific limits are configurable and may vary based on the client's subscription.


## 7. Versioning Strategy

The API uses versioning in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/documents/convert`).


## 8. Security Considerations

The API employs API key authentication and rate limiting to enhance security.  All data is transmitted over HTTPS.  Input validation is performed to prevent injection attacks.


## 9. Example Usage (cURL)

See examples provided in the endpoint definitions section.


## 10. Testing Guidelines

Unit and integration tests are included in the project repository.  End-to-end testing should be performed using tools like Postman or curl to validate functionality and error handling.


## 11.  OpenAPI Specification

The complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification is available at  `http://localhost:3001/api-docs` (or the location specified in your environment). This specification provides a machine-readable definition of the API, allowing for automated testing and client generation.


This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API.  Further details can be found in the OpenAPI specification.  Remember to replace `http://localhost:3001` with the actual API endpoint URL in your environment.
