# ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework API Documentation

## 1. API Overview

The ADPA API is a RESTful service built using Node.js, TypeScript, and TypeSpec, providing programmatic access to ADPA's document generation, project management, and data management capabilities.  It adheres to OpenAPI 3.0 specifications, enabling seamless integration with various client applications.  The API is designed for scalability, security, and ease of use within enterprise environments.

**Base URL:**  `https://api.adpa.com/v1` (Replace with your deployed instance URL)

**Authentication:**  See Section 2.

**Versioning:**  Versioning is handled through URL paths (e.g., `/v1`, `/v2`).

## 2. Authentication Methods

The ADPA API utilizes API keys and OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

**a) API Key Authentication:**

*   Suitable for non-interactive integrations and initial testing.
*   Obtain an API key from the ADPA admin interface.
*   Include the API key in the `x-api-key` header of each request.

**b) OAuth 2.0 Authentication (Recommended for Production):**

*   Provides enhanced security and supports granular access control.
*   Requires registration of your application within the ADPA system to obtain client credentials.
*   Use the `Authorization` header with a Bearer token obtained through the OAuth 2.0 flow.  The specific flow (e.g., Authorization Code Grant, Client Credentials Grant) will depend on your application's needs and is detailed in the separate OAuth 2.0 documentation.


## 3. Endpoint Definitions

All endpoints are prefixed with `/v1`.  Responses are in JSON format unless otherwise specified.


**3.1 Document Generation:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/generate`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request:**
    ```json
    {
      "framework": "babok", // babok, pmbok, dmbok
      "documentType": "stakeholderAnalysis", // See available document types below
      "parameters": {
        // Framework-specific parameters
        "stakeholders": [
          {"name": "John Doe", "role": "Product Owner"},
          {"name": "Jane Smith", "role": "Developer"}
        ]
      },
      "format": "markdown" // markdown, json, html, pdf
    }
    ```
*   **Response (Success):**
    ```json
    {
      "documentId": "uniqueDocumentId",
      "documentUrl": "/v1/documents/uniqueDocumentId",
      "status": "completed"
    }
    ```
*   **Response (Error):**  See Section 5.


**3.2 Document Retrieval:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/documents/{documentId}`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Response:** The generated document content in the specified format.


**3.3 Framework Listing:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/frameworks`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Response:**
    ```json
    [
      {"name": "babok", "version": "3.0"},
      {"name": "pmbok", "version": "7th Edition"},
      {"name": "dmbok", "version": "2.0"}
    ]
    ```


**3.4 Document Type Listing (for a given framework):**

*   **Endpoint:** `/frameworks/{framework}/documentTypes`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Response:**  An array of strings representing available document types for the specified framework.


**3.5 Template Listing:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/templates`
*   **Method:** `GET`
*   **Response:** A list of available document templates.  Each template object will include a name, description, and framework.


**3.6 Confluence Integration:** (Requires OAuth 2.0)

*   **Endpoint:** `/confluence/publish`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request:**  Details to be provided in separate Confluence integration documentation.


**3.7 SharePoint Integration:** (Requires OAuth 2.0)

*   **Endpoint:** `/sharepoint/upload`
*   **Method:** `POST`
*   **Request:** Details to be provided in separate SharePoint integration documentation.



## 4. Request/Response Formats

All requests and responses use JSON.  Specific parameter schemas are defined within the OpenAPI specification.  Error responses follow the structure described in Section 5.


## 5. Error Codes

Errors are returned as JSON objects with the following structure:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "Error description",
    "details": "Additional details (optional)"
  }
}
```

**Example Error Codes:**

*   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.
*   `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required or invalid credentials.
*   `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions.
*   `404 Not Found`: Resource not found.
*   `500 Internal Server Error`:  An unexpected server error occurred.
*   `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded.


## 6. Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse.  The specific limits are defined in the separate rate limiting documentation.


## 7. Security Considerations

*   All communication should be done over HTTPS.
*   API keys should be treated as confidential information.
*   OAuth 2.0 provides robust authentication and authorization.
*   Input validation and sanitization are performed to prevent injection attacks.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing are conducted.


## 8. Example Usage (cURL)

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://api.adpa.com/v1/generate \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "framework": "babok",
    "documentType": "stakeholderAnalysis",
    "parameters": {
      "stakeholders": [{"name": "John Doe", "role": "Product Owner"}]
    },
    "format": "json"
  }'
```


## 9. Testing Guidelines

Unit and integration tests are provided within the ADPA repository.  Refer to the repository's documentation for details on running these tests.  For integration testing, you should use a test environment to avoid impacting production data.
