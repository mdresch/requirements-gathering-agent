# ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API Documentation

## 1. API Overview

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API is a production-ready RESTful service built with Express.js and TypeScript.  It leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks, supporting Fortune 500-grade deliverables.  The API prioritizes speed, accuracy, and scalability, reducing the time required for requirements elicitation from weeks to seconds.  It adheres to API-first design principles, with comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.

## 2. Authentication Methods

The API uses API key-based authentication for security.  Each request must include a valid API key in the `X-API-Key` header.  Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse.  For enterprise deployments,  consider integration with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for more robust authentication and authorization.

**Request Header:**

```http
X-API-Key: <your_api_key>
```

## 3. Endpoint Definitions

All endpoints are located under the base URL: `/api/v1/`.

**3.1 Document Generation API**

* **POST `/documents/convert`**: Generates BABOK enterprise frameworks.

    * **Request Body (application/json):**
        ```json
        {
          "projectName": "Project Name",
          "stakeholders": [ /* Array of stakeholder objects */ ],
          "requirements": [ /* Array of requirement objects */ ],
          "regulatoryCompliance": [ /* Array of compliance standards */ ],
          "templateId": "<optional template ID>" // For custom templates
        }
        ```
        * **Stakeholder Object:**  `{ name: "Stakeholder Name", role: "Stakeholder Role", influence: "High/Medium/Low" }`
        * **Requirement Object:** `{ description: "Requirement Description", priority: "High/Medium/Low" }`
        * **Compliance Standard Object:** `{ name: "Compliance Standard Name", details: "Details about the standard" }`


    * **Response (200 OK):**
        ```json
        {
          "jobId": "UUID",
          "status": "processing"
        }
        ```
        Returns a job ID to track the generation process.

    * **Response (400 Bad Request):** Invalid request body.  Includes detailed error messages.
    * **Response (401 Unauthorized):** Invalid or missing API key.
    * **Response (500 Internal Server Error):** Unexpected server error.


* **GET `/documents/jobs`**: Lists processing jobs.  Supports pagination.

    * **Query Parameters:** `page`, `limit`
    * **Response (200 OK):**  An array of job objects with `jobId`, `status`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

* **GET `/documents/jobs/{jobId}/status`**: Checks the status of a specific job.

    * **Response (200 OK):** `{ jobId: "UUID", status: "processing/complete/failed", progress: "percentage", resultUrl: "URL to download the document" }`

* **GET `/documents/download/{jobId}`**: Downloads the generated document.  Requires authentication and job completion.  Content-Type will vary based on the generated format (e.g., `application/pdf`, `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`).


**3.2 Template Management API (Optional)**

* **POST `/templates`**: Creates a new custom template. Requires administrator privileges.

    * **Request Body (application/json):**  Template definition (schema defined in API specifications).

* **GET `/templates`**: Lists available templates.

* **GET `/templates/{templateId}`**: Retrieves a specific template.

* **PUT `/templates/{templateId}`**: Updates a specific template. Requires administrator privileges.


## 4. Request/Response Formats

All requests use `application/json` content type.  Responses are also primarily JSON, except for document downloads.  Error responses include detailed error messages and HTTP status codes.

## 5. Error Codes

Standard HTTP status codes are used (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).  Error responses include detailed error messages in JSON format for easy debugging.

## 6. Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse.  The specific limits are configurable and can be found in the API specifications.

## 7. Versioning Strategy

API versioning is implemented using URI versioning (`/api/v1/`).  Future versions will be indicated by incrementing the version number (e.g., `/api/v2/`).

## 8. Security Considerations

* **API Keys:**  Use strong, unique API keys.  Rotate keys regularly.
* **HTTPS:**  The API should only be accessed over HTTPS.
* **Input Validation:**  All input data is rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Limits the number of requests to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
* **Authentication:**  Secure authentication mechanisms are used to verify the identity of clients.


## 9. Example Usage (cURL)

```bash
# Generate a BABOK framework
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/documents/convert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: <your_api_key>" \
  -d '{
        "projectName": "My Project",
        "stakeholders": [{"name": "John Doe", "role": "Project Manager", "influence": "High"}],
        "requirements": [{"description": "Requirement 1", "priority": "High"}],
        "regulatoryCompliance": [{"name": "GDPR", "details": "General Data Protection Regulation"}]
      }'
```

## 10. Testing Guidelines

Unit and integration tests are included in the project.  Comprehensive end-to-end testing should be performed before deployment.  The OpenAPI specifications can be used to generate client SDKs and automate testing.


## 11. OpenAPI Specifications

The complete OpenAPI 3.0 specifications are available at `<link_to_openapi_specs>`.  These specifications provide a machine-readable definition of the API, including all endpoints, request/response formats, and data models.  They can be used to generate client SDKs in various programming languages.


This documentation provides a high-level overview.  Refer to the OpenAPI specifications for detailed information.  Remember to replace `<your_api_key>` and `<link_to_openapi_specs>` with the actual values.
