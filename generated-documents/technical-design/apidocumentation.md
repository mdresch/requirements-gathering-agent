## Project Backup Vermigerous API Documentation

This document details the RESTful API for Project Backup Vermigerous, a system designed for automated, secure, and verifiable monthly backups.

**1. API Overview**

The Project Backup Vermigerous API provides functionalities for managing backups, including scheduling, retrieval of metadata, and triggering restores (in a test environment).  This API is designed to be used by automated systems and scripts, rather than directly by human users.  All endpoints require authentication using API keys (details below).

**2. Authentication**

Authentication is performed using API keys.  Each API key is associated with a specific user or system and grants access to specific functionalities. API keys should be treated as sensitive information and kept confidential.

* **Header:** `X-API-Key: <your_api_key>`


**3. Endpoint Definitions**

All endpoints are located under the base URL `/api/v1/backups`.

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                                                                     | Request Body                               | Response Body                                                              | Error Codes |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| POST    | `/schedule`          | Schedules a new backup.                                                        | `{projectName: string, retentionPolicy: string}` | `{backupId: string, scheduledTime: string}`                                  | 400, 401    |
| GET     | `/metadata/{backupId}` | Retrieves metadata for a specific backup.                                       | None                                         | `{projectName: string, year: int, month: int, size: int, checksum: string}` | 400, 401, 404 |
| GET     | `/list`              | Retrieves a list of backups, optionally filtered by project name and date range. | `{projectName: string (optional), year: int (optional), month: int (optional)}` | `[{backupId: string, projectName: string, year: int, month: int, size: int, checksum: string}]` | 400, 401    |
| POST    | `/restore/{backupId}` | Triggers a test restore of a specific backup in a designated sandbox environment. | None                                         | `{restoreStatus: string, logUrl: string}`                                      | 400, 401, 404, 500 |


**4. Request/Response Formats**

All requests and responses use JSON.  Example requests and responses are provided below.


**5. Error Codes**

| Code | Description                               |
|------|-------------------------------------------|
| 400  | Bad Request: Invalid request parameters.   |
| 401  | Unauthorized: Invalid or missing API key. |
| 404  | Not Found: Backup not found.             |
| 500  | Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred. |


**6. Rate Limiting**

The API has a rate limit of 100 requests per minute per API key.  Exceeding this limit will result in a 429 Too Many Requests error.


**7. Versioning Strategy**

The API uses versioning in the URL (`/api/v1/backups`).  Future versions will be indicated by incrementing the version number.


**8. Security Considerations**

* **API Keys:**  API keys are used for authentication.  They should be treated as sensitive information and protected accordingly.
* **HTTPS:** All communication with the API should be done over HTTPS.
* **Input Validation:** All inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is implemented to prevent information leakage.
* **Secure Storage:** Backups are stored in a secure and immutable storage location (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with WORM).  Backups are encrypted both at rest and in transit.


**9. Example Usage**

**Scheduling a Backup (POST /api/v1/backups/schedule):**

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "projectName": "MyProject",
    "retentionPolicy": "3 months"
  }' \
  https://api.example.com/api/v1/backups/schedule
```

**Retrieving Backup Metadata (GET /api/v1/backups/metadata/{backupId}):**

```bash
curl -X GET \
  -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.example.com/api/v1/backups/metadata/b1234567890
```


**10. Testing Guidelines**

Thorough testing should be performed before deploying the API to production.  Unit tests should be written to verify the functionality of individual components.  Integration tests should be used to verify the interaction between different components.  Load tests should be performed to ensure that the API can handle the expected load.


This documentation provides a starting point. Further details on specific error messages, request parameters, and response structures will be provided in subsequent documentation.  The OpenAPI specification will be available shortly.
