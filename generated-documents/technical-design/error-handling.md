# ADPA Error Handling Guidelines

## 1. Error Handling Strategy

**Objective:**  
Establish a robust, consistent, and maintainable approach to error handling across the ADPA framework—including CLI, REST API, document generation, AI provider integration, and third-party enterprise integrations.

**Core Principles:**
- **Fail Fast, Fail Loud:** Detect and surface errors early; do not silently ignore failures.
- **Consistent Error Model:** Use structured error objects (preferably with TypeScript types/interfaces) across all modules.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Distinguish between recoverable (expected) and unrecoverable (unexpected/systemic) errors.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Provide fallback mechanisms wherever possible, especially for multi-provider AI and integrations.
- **User-Centric Messaging:** Show clear, actionable error messages to end users; avoid leaking sensitive technical details.

**Patterns:**
- Use `try...catch` for asynchronous operations.
- Throw typed/custom errors (e.g., `AIProviderError`, `ValidationError`).
- Handle errors at the appropriate layer (API middleware, CLI entry point, integration adapters).
- Always clean up resources (e.g., file handles, network connections) in error scenarios.

---

## 2. Error Categories

**a. System Errors**
- Out-of-memory, disk full, network unavailable, process crashes.

**b. Application Errors**
- Invalid user input (validation failures)
- Unsupported operations (e.g., unknown document template)
- Configuration errors (missing API keys, misconfigured environment)

**c. Integration/Provider Errors**
- AI provider API failures (rate limit, quota exceeded, authentication)
- External service outages (SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe APIs)
- Network timeouts, upstream dependency errors

**d. Security & Access Errors**
- Authentication failures (invalid/missing tokens or API keys)
- Authorization failures (insufficient permissions, forbidden actions)

**e. Data Errors**
- Corrupt or missing files
- Data parsing/serialization issues
- Database or configuration inconsistencies

**f. Business Logic Errors**
- Workflow constraint violations (e.g., attempting to generate a document with incomplete data)
- Compliance or standards validation failures

---

## 3. Error Logging

**Objectives:**  
Enable root cause analysis, support audit/compliance, and facilitate monitoring/alerting.

**Standards:**
- Use [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) as the centralized logging framework.
- Log at appropriate levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`.
- Include structured metadata: timestamp, requestId/traceId, userId (if applicable), module, operation, stack trace (for errors).
- Mask sensitive data (API keys, tokens, PII) before logging.

**Sample Log Entry (JSON):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-08T15:23:44.123Z",
  "level": "error",
  "requestId": "a1b2c3d4",
  "userId": "user-123",
  "module": "ai/openaiProvider",
  "operation": "generateDocument",
  "message": "OpenAI API rate limit exceeded",
  "errorCode": "AI_RATE_LIMIT",
  "details": { "provider": "openai", "quota": "60/min" },
  "stack": "Error: ... at ..."
}
```
**Logging Best Practices**
- Log errors at the point of occurrence; propagate context upward.
- Use child loggers for different modules.
- Integrate with Express middleware for automatic API request/response logging.
- CLI errors should be logged to both console (stderr) and log files.
- For integrations, log both requests and responses (with redacted secrets).

---

## 4. Error Reporting

**API (REST):**
- Use [RFC 7807 Problem Details](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) for error responses:
```json
{
  "type": "https://adpa.com/errors/validation",
  "title": "Validation Failed",
  "status": 400,
  "detail": "The 'projectName' field is required.",
  "instance": "/api/v1/generate",
  "errors": [
    { "field": "projectName", "message": "Required" }
  ]
}
```
- Always include HTTP status code, error type, and human-readable detail.

**CLI:**
- Show concise, user-friendly error output.
- Use color coding (e.g., red for errors via [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)).
- For `--verbose`, display stack trace and log file location.

**Web/Admin Interface:**
- Display alerts or banners with actionable error messages.
- Avoid technical jargon or stack traces for end users.

---

## 5. Recovery Procedures

**Automated Recovery:**
- Use retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network, rate limits).
- For AI providers, automatic failover to backup provider on sustained failures.
- When possible, resume interrupted document generation or upload jobs.
- Clean up partial output (temporary files, incomplete database entries) on failure.

**Manual Recovery:**
- Provide clear instructions in error messages for next steps (e.g., “Please check your API key and try again”).
- Enable users to re-run failed jobs via CLI, UI, or API.
- Document recovery steps for common failures in the troubleshooting guide.

---

## 6. Retry Mechanisms

- Use [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) for retries (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s, ... up to max 5 attempts).
- Only retry on transient errors (network timeouts, 429/503 from providers).
- Do **not** retry on permanent errors (validation, authentication, permission denied).
- For multi-provider AI, if a provider fails, mark as unhealthy and attempt with the next available provider.
- Log all retry attempts with reasons and outcomes.

**Sample Retry Logic:**
```typescript
async function withRetry<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>, retries = 5): Promise<T> {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try { return await fn(); }
    catch (err) {
      if (isTransient(err) && i < retries - 1) {
        await delay(2 ** i * 1000); // exponential backoff
        continue;
      }
      throw err;
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Circuit Breakers

**Purpose:**  
Prevent cascading failures and improve system resilience when external dependencies are unstable.

- Use a circuit breaker pattern (e.g., [opossum](https://github.com/nodeshift/opossum)) for all critical external integrations (AI providers, SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe).
- Automatically “open” the circuit (block calls) after N consecutive failures.
- After a defined interval, “half-open” to probe if the dependency has recovered.
- Fall back to alternate providers or degrade gracefully if all circuits are open.
- Expose circuit breaker status in health endpoints and monitoring dashboards.

---

## 8. User Error Messages

**Goals:**
- Be clear, actionable, and non-technical for end-users.
- For developers/admins, provide detailed diagnostics (with `--verbose` flag or API debug mode).

**Guidelines:**
- Indicate what went wrong and how the user can resolve it (e.g., "Authentication failed: Please check your API key.")
- Avoid exposing sensitive technical details in UI or API responses.
- Reference documentation or support channels when appropriate.
- For admin/developer errors, display error code and log file reference.

**Examples:**
- “Unable to generate document: Required field ‘stakeholders’ is missing.”
- “Connection to SharePoint failed: Please verify your network and SharePoint credentials.”
- “AI provider quota exceeded. Retrying with backup provider…”

---

## 9. Monitoring and Alerts

**Objectives:**  
Enable proactive detection and remediation of errors.

**Practices:**
- Integrate with observability tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/ELK stack, Azure Monitor).
- Expose health endpoints (`/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/health/ready`) with component status, including circuit breaker states.
- Emit metrics for: error rates, provider failures, retry counts, circuit breaker trips, queue backlogs.
- Configure alerting rules for:
  - High error rates (API 5xx, provider errors)
  - Circuit breakers open for extended periods
  - Authentication/authorization failures
  - Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk)
- Provide log aggregation and searchability (e.g., centralized Winston logs, Azure Log Analytics).

---

## 10. Troubleshooting Guide

**For End Users:**
- If you see “Authentication failed”, verify API keys and permissions.
- For “Document generation failed”, check input data and template validity.
- For “Provider unavailable”, try again later or contact your administrator.

**For Administrators/Developers:**
- Review logs in the default log directory or as specified in your environment.
- Use health endpoints to check system/component status.
- Check circuit breaker dashboards for integration health.
- If retry/backoff is exhausted, investigate external provider status (quota, service health).
- For configuration errors, validate your `.env` and integration-specific config files.
- Consult documentation for provider-specific limits, permissions, and setup steps.
- For persistent issues, escalate with logs and error codes to the support team.
