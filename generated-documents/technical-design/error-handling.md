## ADPA Error Handling Guidelines

These guidelines detail the error handling strategy for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), ensuring system reliability, maintainability, and a positive user experience.  ADPA's distributed nature and reliance on external services (AI providers) necessitate a robust and layered approach to error handling.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

ADPA employs a layered error handling strategy encompassing:

* **Prevention:** Proactive measures to prevent errors through input validation, robust API interactions, and resource management.
* **Detection:** Mechanisms to detect errors at various stages (input, processing, output).
* **Handling:** Appropriate responses to detected errors, including graceful degradation, retries, and fallback mechanisms.
* **Logging:** Detailed logging of all errors for analysis and debugging.
* **Reporting:** Mechanisms for reporting critical errors to developers and users.
* **Recovery:** Procedures to recover from errors, including automatic retries and manual intervention.


**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized for better management and analysis:

* **Input Errors:** Invalid user input, missing configuration parameters, incorrect file formats.
* **Processing Errors:** Errors during document generation (e.g., AI provider failures, template parsing errors, context limitations).
* **Output Errors:** Errors during file writing, format conversion, or other output operations.
* **System Errors:** Internal system failures (e.g., memory leaks, unexpected exceptions).
* **API Errors:** Errors from external APIs (AI providers, file storage services).  This category includes rate limits, authentication failures, and service unavailability.
* **Data Errors:** Inconsistent or corrupted data discovered during document processing.


**3. Error Logging:**

* **Centralized Logging:** All errors are logged to a centralized logging system (e.g., using a dedicated logging library like Winston or Bunyan).
* **Structured Logging:**  Logs are formatted consistently using a structured logging approach (e.g., JSON) for easier parsing and analysis.  Include timestamp, error level (ERROR, WARNING, INFO), error type, error message, stack trace, relevant context (e.g., document being processed, AI provider used), and a unique identifier for each error instance.
* **Log Levels:**  Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) to filter and prioritize log messages.
* **Log Rotation:** Implement log rotation to manage log file size and prevent disk space exhaustion.
* **Error Monitoring:** Integrate logging with a monitoring system (e.g., Datadog, Sentry, ELK stack) for real-time error tracking and alerts.


**4. Error Reporting:**

* **User Error Messages:** User-friendly error messages are displayed to the user for common, non-critical errors.  Avoid technical jargon and provide actionable advice.
* **Developer Error Reporting:** Critical errors are reported to developers through a dedicated error tracking system (e.g., Sentry) with detailed context and stack traces.
* **Automated Alerts:**  Configure alerts for critical errors (e.g., via email or SMS) to ensure timely intervention.


**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Automatic Retries:** Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary API unavailability).  Configure retry limits to prevent infinite loops.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:** Provide fallback mechanisms for critical operations, such as using a different AI provider if one is unavailable.
* **Manual Intervention:** For persistent errors, provide mechanisms for manual intervention and troubleshooting.


**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

* **Exponential Backoff:**  Increase the delay between retries exponentially to avoid overwhelming the failing service.
* **Jitter:** Add random jitter to the retry delays to avoid synchronized retries from multiple clients.
* **Retry Limits:** Set a maximum number of retries to prevent infinite retry loops.


**7. Circuit Breakers:**

* **Implement circuit breakers** using a library like Hystrix or Resilience4j to prevent cascading failures.  Circuit breakers temporarily stop requests to a failing service after a certain number of consecutive failures, allowing the service time to recover before resuming requests.


**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:**  Messages should be easy to understand and avoid technical jargon.
* **Actionable Advice:**  Provide suggestions on how to resolve the error.
* **Error Codes (Optional):**  For advanced users, consider including error codes to aid in troubleshooting.


**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor key metrics (e.g., error rates, API latency, resource usage) using a monitoring system.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts for critical errors and performance issues.


**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  Provide a detailed troubleshooting guide covering common errors and their solutions.
* **Log Analysis:**  Guide users on how to analyze logs to identify the root cause of errors.
* **Support Channels:**  Establish support channels (e.g., email, forum) for users to report and get help with errors.


**Specific Considerations for ADPA:**

* **AI Provider Failures:**  Handle transient errors from AI providers gracefully, using retries and fallbacks.  Log detailed information about provider failures (e.g., error codes, response messages).
* **Context Limitations:**  Implement mechanisms to handle situations where the project context exceeds the limits of the AI model.  This might involve summarizing or chunking the context.
* **Document Validation:**  Thoroughly validate generated documents against PMBOK standards and internal quality checks.  Report validation errors to developers.
* **File System Errors:**  Handle file system errors (e.g., permission issues, disk space exhaustion) appropriately.


By adhering to these guidelines, ADPA will be more robust, reliable, and provide a better user experience.  Regular review and updates to these guidelines are essential as the system evolves.
