## Error Handling Guidelines: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

These guidelines outline the error handling strategy for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, focusing on reliability, maintainability, and a positive user experience.  The project's reliance on external APIs (AI providers, SharePoint, etc.) necessitates robust error handling to gracefully manage failures.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

We employ a layered approach to error handling, combining preventative measures (input validation, rate limiting) with reactive mechanisms (exception handling, retries, circuit breakers).  The primary goal is to prevent errors whenever possible, and when errors occur, to handle them gracefully, providing informative feedback to users and allowing for potential recovery or fallback mechanisms.

**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized for better management and analysis:

* **Application Errors:** Internal errors within the application code (e.g., bugs, unexpected exceptions).
* **API Errors:** Errors returned by external APIs (e.g., HTTP 4xx/5xx errors, rate limits exceeded, service unavailable).  Specific error codes from each API should be documented and handled appropriately.
* **Data Errors:** Errors related to data validation or processing (e.g., invalid input, missing data, data inconsistencies).
* **System Errors:** Errors related to the underlying infrastructure (e.g., database connection failures, disk space issues).
* **Security Errors:** Errors related to authentication, authorization, or security vulnerabilities.

**3. Error Logging:**

* **Centralized Logging:** Use a structured logging library (Winston) to record all errors with consistent formatting.  Logs should include timestamps, severity levels (error, warning, info, debug), error messages, stack traces, relevant context (request ID, user ID, API endpoint), and potentially custom fields depending on the error type.
* **Log Levels:** Employ appropriate log levels to filter and manage the volume of log messages.  Critical errors should be logged at the `error` level, while less severe issues can be logged at `warning` or `info`.
* **Error Tracking:** Integrate with a centralized error tracking system (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to aggregate, monitor, and analyze errors.  This facilitates proactive identification and resolution of recurring issues.

**4. Error Reporting:**

* **API Responses:**  API errors should be returned to the client with appropriate HTTP status codes (4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors) and a JSON payload containing a user-friendly error message, an error code, and potentially a developer-facing error message (for debugging purposes).  Consider using a standardized error response format.  Example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "INVALID_INPUT",
    "message": "The provided input data is invalid. Please check the documentation for valid input formats.",
    "details": "Validation failed for field 'projectName':  must be non-empty string" // For developers
  }
}
```

* **User Notifications:** For CLI usage, provide clear and concise error messages to the user.

* **Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement monitoring to detect critical errors and trigger alerts (e.g., email, PagerDuty) to the development team.


**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retry logic for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary API unavailability).  Exponential backoff strategies should be used to avoid overwhelming the failing service.
* **Circuit Breakers:** Use circuit breakers to prevent repeated attempts to access a failing service.  This protects the application from cascading failures.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:** Provide alternative solutions or fallback mechanisms when a primary service is unavailable.  For example, if the primary AI provider fails, attempt to use a secondary provider.
* **Graceful Degradation:** Design the system to gracefully degrade functionality when errors occur.  Prioritize core functionality over less critical features.

**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

* **Exponential Backoff:**  Implement retries with exponentially increasing delays between attempts. This gives the failing service time to recover without overwhelming it.
* **Maximum Retries:** Set a maximum number of retries to prevent infinite loops.
* **Jitter:** Add random jitter to retry delays to further reduce the load on the failing service and avoid synchronized retries.

**7. Circuit Breakers:**

* **Open/Closed/Half-Open States:** Implement a circuit breaker with open, closed, and half-open states to manage the availability of external services.
* **Timeout:** Set a timeout for each service call to prevent indefinite blocking.

**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:** User-facing error messages should be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Avoid technical jargon.
* **Actionable:**  Messages should provide guidance on how to resolve the error or where to find more information.
* **Localization:** Consider supporting multiple languages.

**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor key metrics (e.g., error rates, latency, throughput) using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify the development team of critical errors or performance degradation.

**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide should be created and maintained, containing common error scenarios, their causes, and solutions.  This guide should be accessible to both users and developers.

**Specific Considerations for ADPA:**

* **AI Provider Errors:** Handle specific errors from OpenAI, Google AI, etc., providing informative messages about API limits, model unavailability, or invalid prompts.
* **SharePoint Integration Errors:**  Handle authentication failures, permission issues, and network problems during SharePoint interactions.  Provide detailed error messages indicating the specific SharePoint operation that failed.
* **BABOK Framework Generation Errors:**  Handle errors during framework generation, such as invalid input data, template errors, or processing failures.


By adhering to these guidelines, the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent will be more robust, reliable, and provide a better user experience.  Regular review and updates to these guidelines are essential to keep pace with evolving system needs and error patterns.
