## ADPA Error Handling Guidelines

These guidelines outline the error handling strategy for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, aiming for robust, reliable operation and a positive user experience.  The guidelines prioritize comprehensive logging, informative user feedback, and automated recovery mechanisms where feasible.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

ADPA employs a layered error handling approach:

* **Prevention:**  Proactive measures to prevent errors through input validation, robust API interactions, and careful resource management.
* **Detection:**  Early detection of errors using exception handling, assertions, and runtime checks.
* **Handling:**  Graceful handling of detected errors to prevent system crashes, maintain data integrity, and provide informative feedback to users.
* **Recovery:**  Automated recovery mechanisms where possible (e.g., retries, circuit breakers) to minimize service disruptions.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Comprehensive logging and monitoring to track errors, identify trends, and facilitate debugging.
* **Reporting:**  Mechanisms to report critical errors to developers and administrators.

**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized for better analysis and handling:

* **Input Errors:** Invalid or malformed user input (e.g., incorrect command-line arguments, invalid configuration files).
* **API Errors:** Errors from external APIs (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), including rate limits, authentication failures, and service unavailability.
* **System Errors:** Internal system errors (e.g., file I/O errors, memory issues, unexpected exceptions).
* **Data Errors:** Issues with data integrity (e.g., inconsistent data, missing data, corrupted files).
* **Configuration Errors:** Issues with the application's configuration (e.g., missing API keys, incorrect settings).
* **Document Generation Errors:** Errors during the generation of documents (e.g., LLM timeout, insufficient context, invalid template).


**3. Error Logging:**

* **Centralized Logging:**  All errors are logged to a central logging system (e.g., using a dedicated logging library like Winston or Bunyan).
* **Structured Logging:**  Logs should be structured (JSON format preferred) for easier parsing and analysis.  Include timestamps, error codes, error messages, stack traces (for non-production environments), relevant context (e.g., user input, API responses, document being processed), and the severity level (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).
* **Log Levels:**  Appropriate log levels should be used to filter and prioritize errors.
* **Rotation and Archiving:**  Log files should be rotated and archived to prevent disk space exhaustion.
* **Security:**  Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, user data) should be masked or redacted from logs.


**4. Error Reporting:**

* **Alerting:**  Critical errors (FATAL) should trigger immediate alerts (e.g., email, PagerDuty) to the development team.  Warnings (WARN) may trigger less urgent alerts depending on frequency and severity.
* **Error Dashboards:**  A centralized dashboard should provide an overview of errors, including their frequency, severity, and impact.
* **Error Tracking System:**  Use an error tracking system (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to capture, aggregate, and analyze errors.  This aids in identifying patterns and prioritizing fixes.


**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Retry Mechanisms:**  For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary API unavailability), automatic retries should be implemented with exponential backoff.  The number of retries and backoff strategy should be configurable.
* **Circuit Breakers:**  For frequently failing external APIs, circuit breakers should be used to prevent cascading failures and allow time for the service to recover.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:**  If retries or circuit breakers fail, fallback mechanisms should be implemented to provide a degraded service or gracefully handle the error.  For example, if an API call fails, a default value could be used or a user notification could be displayed.
* **Data Recovery:**  Procedures should be in place to recover from data corruption or loss.  This may involve database backups, version control, or other data redundancy strategies.


**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

* **Exponential Backoff:** The delay between retries increases exponentially.  This prevents overwhelming the failing service.
* **Jitter:** Add a small random delay to the backoff to avoid synchronized retries from multiple clients.
* **Maximum Retries:**  Limit the number of retries to prevent infinite loops.
* **Retryable Error Codes:**  Only retry specific error codes that indicate transient errors.


**7. Circuit Breakers:**

* **State:**  The circuit breaker has three states: closed (normal operation), open (failure detected, no retries), half-open (limited retries allowed).
* **Threshold:**  The number of consecutive failures that trigger the open state.
* **Timeout:**  The time the circuit breaker remains open before transitioning to the half-open state.
* **Success Threshold:** The number of successful retries in the half-open state before closing the circuit breaker.


**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:**  Error messages should be clear, concise, and easy to understand for the user.
* **Actionable:**  Error messages should suggest actions the user can take to resolve the problem.
* **Consistent Formatting:**  Use a consistent format for error messages (e.g., always start with "Error:").
* **Error Codes:**  Consider including error codes for more technical users.
* **Localization:**  Translate error messages into multiple languages.


**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:**  Monitor key metrics (e.g., error rates, latency, throughput) in real-time to detect issues early.
* **Alerting Thresholds:**  Set thresholds for key metrics to trigger alerts when issues occur.
* **Automated Notifications:**  Send automated notifications to the development team when alerts are triggered.


**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide should be provided to users, covering common errors and their solutions. This guide should be easily accessible through the application's documentation or help system.  It should include:

* **Common Errors:** A list of common errors and their causes.
* **Solutions:**  Steps to resolve each error.
* **Error Codes:**  Explanation of error codes.
* **Log Analysis:**  Guidance on how to interpret log files to diagnose errors.

**Specific Considerations for ADPA:**

* **LLM Specific Errors:** Handle specific errors from the different LLMs (e.g., token limits exceeded, model unavailable).  Implement graceful degradation strategies (e.g., truncating input, using a simpler model).
* **Context Management Errors:**  Handle errors related to context building and management.  Implement strategies to handle insufficient context or context corruption.
* **Document Validation Errors:**  Implement robust validation checks for generated documents to ensure they meet PMBOK standards.  Report validation errors to the user with clear instructions.
* **AI Provider Failover:**  Implement failover mechanisms to switch to a different AI provider if the primary provider is unavailable.

These guidelines provide a foundation for robust error handling in ADPA.  Specific implementation details will depend on the chosen technologies and the complexity of individual components.  Regular review and updates to these guidelines are crucial to maintain the system's reliability and user experience.
