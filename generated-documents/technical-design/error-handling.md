## Requirements Gathering Agent: Error Handling Guidelines

These guidelines define the error handling strategy for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, ensuring system reliability, maintainability, and a positive user experience.  The guidelines address various error categories, logging, reporting, recovery, and monitoring.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

The RGA will employ a layered error handling approach combining centralized logging and reporting with localized handling for specific errors.  This strategy aims to balance the need for detailed diagnostic information with graceful degradation and informative user feedback.  The guiding principle is to fail safely and informatively, preventing cascading failures and providing users with actionable insights.

**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized to facilitate targeted handling and analysis:

* **System Errors:**  Hardware or software failures (e.g., database connection issues, disk space exhaustion, network outages).  These require immediate attention and potentially automated escalation.
* **API Errors:** Errors from external APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google AI, Azure services).  These require retry mechanisms, circuit breakers, and potentially fallback strategies.
* **Data Errors:** Invalid input data, corrupted files, or inconsistencies in data structures.  These need robust validation and data sanitization.
* **Configuration Errors:** Incorrect or missing configuration parameters.  These should be clearly communicated to the user with instructions for correction.
* **User Errors:**  Incorrect usage or input from the user (e.g., invalid command-line arguments, incorrect file paths).  These require clear and helpful error messages.


**3. Error Logging:**

All errors will be logged using Winston, following these standards:

* **Log Level:**  Use appropriate log levels (error, warn, info, debug) to categorize errors based on severity.
* **Contextual Information:** Include timestamps, request IDs, user IDs (if applicable), error messages, stack traces, and relevant contextual data (e.g., API response codes, input parameters).
* **Structured Logging:**  Use JSON formatting for easy parsing and analysis by monitoring tools.
* **Log Rotation:** Implement log rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion.
* **Separate Logs:** Consider separate log files for different components (e.g., API, CLI, data processing) for easier troubleshooting.


**4. Error Reporting:**

* **Centralized Monitoring:**  Use a centralized monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor, Datadog) to aggregate and analyze logs.  This allows for proactive identification of issues and performance bottlenecks.
* **Alerting:** Set up alerts based on critical error thresholds (e.g., high error rates, specific error types) to notify the operations team immediately.
* **Error Tracking System:** Integrate with an error tracking system (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to track, prioritize, and resolve errors efficiently.

**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement exponential backoff retry strategies for transient API errors.  This prevents overwhelming external services and allows for temporary network hiccups.
* **Circuit Breakers:** Use circuit breakers to prevent repeated attempts to call failing services, allowing time for recovery.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:**  Provide alternative strategies for critical functions in case of API failures (e.g., using a different AI provider or a simplified processing method).
* **Data Recovery:**  Implement data backup and recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss.


**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

The `axios` library will be used for most API calls.  Retry logic will be implemented using `axios-retry` with exponential backoff and a maximum number of retries.  Retry conditions will be specific to the API being called.


**7. Circuit Breakers:**

A circuit breaker pattern will be implemented using a library like `circuit-breaker`. This will prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services after a certain number of consecutive failures.  A health check will be used to determine when the circuit should be closed again.


**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:** Error messages should be easy to understand, even for non-technical users.
* **Actionable:**  Messages should guide users on how to resolve the issue.
* **Consistent Formatting:**  Use a consistent format for error messages (e.g., consistent prefixes, use of codes).
* **Localization:**  Consider localization for international users.


**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Key Metrics:**  Monitor key metrics such as API request latency, error rates, and resource usage.
* **Dashboards:**  Create dashboards to visualize key metrics and identify potential problems.
* **Alerting Thresholds:**  Define alerting thresholds for critical metrics to proactively identify issues.


**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide will be included in the documentation, covering common error scenarios, their causes, and their solutions. This will include logs examples and steps to gather diagnostic information.


**Specific Implementation Notes:**

* **Error Codes:** Use meaningful and consistent error codes to identify the type and cause of errors.
* **Exception Handling:**  Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
* **Custom Error Classes:** Create custom error classes to represent specific error types.
* **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the error handling mechanisms to ensure they work correctly.


By adhering to these guidelines, the RGA project will be more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly, providing a reliable and efficient service.
