## Performance Requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

These performance requirements are defined to ensure ADPA meets the needs of enterprise users while maintaining a high level of responsiveness and scalability.  The requirements are categorized for clarity and cover various aspects of performance.  Specific values are provided where possible based on the existing documentation, but many will require further testing and refinement.

**I. Performance Goals:**

* **Overall Goal:** ADPA should consistently deliver high-quality, PMBOK-compliant documentation within acceptable timeframes, even under peak loads.  The system should be reliable, robust and easily scalable to accommodate future growth.

**II. Response Time Requirements:**

* **Context Discovery:**  Analysis of 83+ markdown files should complete within 5 seconds (as demonstrated). This should be maintained even with a significant increase in the number of files (e.g., 500+ files) with a target response time of under 30 seconds.
* **Document Generation:**  The generation of individual documents (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register) should ideally complete within 10-30 seconds, depending on document complexity and AI model used.  More complex documents (e.g., those requiring extensive cross-referencing or synthesis) may have longer acceptable response times, but these should be clearly defined and tested.
* **CLI Commands:**  Execution of CLI commands should return results within 2-5 seconds for simple commands and within 10-30 seconds for more complex commands (such as generating the full PMBOK suite).

**III. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Documents per Hour:** The system should be capable of generating at least 100 individual documents per hour under normal load conditions, scaling to 500 documents per hour under peak load conditions. This requires rigorous testing to ensure consistency across different document types and AI models.
* **Users Concurrent:** The system should support at least 50 concurrent users during peak hours without significant degradation in performance.  This will be tested using load testing tools.

**IV. Scalability Requirements:**

* **Data Volume:** The system should handle a growing volume of project data (markdown files, external sources, etc.) without performance degradation.  This will be addressed through database optimization and efficient data retrieval strategies.
* **User Base:** The system should be easily scalable to support a growing user base (hundreds to thousands of users). This requires a scalable architecture using cloud-based services.
* **AI Model Usage:** The system should handle concurrent requests to multiple AI models efficiently, and gracefully handle potential failures of individual models.  This requires robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.


**V. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU:**  CPU utilization should remain below 80% under peak load conditions.  This will require monitoring and optimization of the application and underlying infrastructure.
* **Memory:** Memory usage should be optimized to avoid excessive memory consumption and ensure system stability.  Memory leaks should be addressed proactively.
* **Disk I/O:** Disk I/O should be optimized to minimize latency and improve response times.  This will involve using efficient database systems and optimizing file access patterns.
* **Network:** Network bandwidth usage should be monitored to ensure sufficient capacity to handle data transfer between the application, AI models, and storage.


**VI. Load Handling:**

* **Peak Load:** The system should be able to handle peak loads (defined by concurrent users and document generation requests) without performance degradation or failure.  This will be validated through load and stress testing.
* **Error Handling:** The system should gracefully handle errors and provide informative messages to users.  This should include retry mechanisms for transient failures.


**VII. Caching Strategy:**

* **Context Caching:**  Implement a caching mechanism for frequently accessed project context to reduce the load on the AI models and improve response times.  This cache should be intelligently managed to avoid stale data.
* **Document Caching:** Explore caching of generated documents, especially for frequently accessed or static documents.  This requires careful consideration of version control and data consistency.


**VIII. Performance Metrics:**

* **Response Times (per document type):** Measured in seconds.
* **Throughput (documents/hour):** Measured in documents generated per hour.
* **Error Rates:** Percentage of failed requests or document generation attempts.
* **CPU Utilization:** Percentage of CPU resources used.
* **Memory Usage:** Amount of memory consumed by the application.
* **Disk I/O:**  Disk read/write operations per second.
* **Network Bandwidth:** Data transfer rate.
* **Concurrent User Capacity:** Maximum number of concurrent users supported without performance degradation.


**IX. Monitoring Requirements:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) using appropriate tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Alerting System:**  Set up alerts to notify administrators of performance issues or critical errors.
* **Logging:**  Comprehensive logging of application events, errors, and performance data for troubleshooting and analysis.


**X. Performance Testing Plan:**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate peak load conditions to identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.
* **Stress Testing:**  Push the system beyond its expected limits to evaluate its robustness and resilience.
* **Unit Testing:**  Test individual components to ensure they meet performance requirements.
* **Integration Testing:** Verify the performance of the integrated system.
* **Regression Testing:**  Regularly test performance after updates or changes to the system.


**XI. Baseline Requirements:**

* The baseline performance will be established using the existing system's performance data as a starting point.  This will be compared against improvements after enhancements are implemented.  Further testing with larger datasets and higher user loads will be required to fully define the baseline.


This detailed performance requirements document provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring ADPA's ongoing success and scalability.  Continuous monitoring and iterative testing will be crucial to maintain high performance and address any emerging issues.
