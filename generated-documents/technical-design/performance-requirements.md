## Performance Requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

These performance requirements are defined to ensure the ADPA application meets the needs of its users and maintains a high level of responsiveness and scalability.  The requirements are categorized for clarity and address various aspects of performance.  Testing methodologies will be defined separately, but should include load testing, stress testing, and soak testing.

**I. Response Time Requirements:**

* **Document Generation:**
    * **Small Projects (<= 10 files, <= 50KB total):**  Average response time under 15 seconds for complete document generation. 95th percentile response time under 30 seconds.
    * **Medium Projects (11-50 files, 51KB - 5MB total):** Average response time under 60 seconds for complete document generation. 95th percentile response time under 120 seconds.
    * **Large Projects (>50 files, >5MB total):** Average response time under 5 minutes for complete document generation. 95th percentile response time under 10 minutes.  Consideration should be given to breaking down large projects into smaller, more manageable chunks for improved performance.
* **CLI Commands:** Each individual CLI command (e.g., `--generate architecturedesign`) should respond within 5 seconds.
* **API Calls (Internal):** Internal API calls between components should have an average response time under 1 second.  95th percentile response time under 2 seconds.

**II. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Concurrent Users:** The system should support at least 100 concurrent users generating documents simultaneously without significant performance degradation (response time increase under 20%).  This should be scaled up based on projected user growth.
* **Document Generation Rate:**  The system should be capable of generating at least 50 documents per hour on average under typical load conditions.

**III. Scalability Requirements:**

* **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should allow for easy horizontal scaling by adding more processing nodes to handle increased load.
* **Vertical Scalability:** The system should be able to handle increased load by upgrading individual server resources (CPU, memory, storage).
* **Database Scalability:** The database (if applicable) should be scalable to handle a growing volume of user data and generated documents.

**IV. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU Utilization:** Average CPU utilization should remain below 70% under typical load conditions.  Spikes during peak load should be managed effectively through scaling.
* **Memory Utilization:** Average memory utilization should remain below 80% under typical load conditions. Memory leaks should be proactively addressed.
* **Disk I/O:** Disk I/O operations should be optimized to minimize latency and ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

**V. Load Handling:**

* **Peak Load:**  The system should be able to handle peak loads of at least 200% of average load without failure or significant performance degradation.
* **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation during periods of high load; inform the user of delays or temporary unavailability without crashing the application.

**VI. Caching Strategy:**

* **Response Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data (e.g., templates, AI model responses) to reduce latency and improve response times.  Consider using a distributed caching solution for scalability.
* **Context Caching:**  Cache pre-processed project contexts to reduce the time spent analyzing project files for repeated document generation requests.

**VII. Performance Metrics:**

The following metrics should be regularly monitored and reported:

* **Average Response Time:** For document generation and CLI commands
* **95th Percentile Response Time:** For document generation and CLI commands
* **Throughput:** Documents generated per hour
* **Concurrent Users:** Number of simultaneous users
* **CPU Utilization:** Percentage of CPU resources used
* **Memory Utilization:** Percentage of memory resources used
* **Disk I/O:** Disk read/write operations per second
* **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed document generation requests
* **Cache Hit Ratio:** For response and context caching

**VIII. Monitoring Requirements:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs) using appropriate tools.
* **Alerting System:** Configure alerts for critical performance thresholds (e.g., high CPU utilization, high error rates).
* **Logging:** Detailed logging of all system events, including errors and performance metrics.

**IX. Performance Testing Plan:**

A comprehensive performance testing plan will be developed and executed to validate that the system meets the performance requirements outlined above. This plan will include:

* **Load Testing:** Simulating a large number of concurrent users to determine the system's capacity.
* **Stress Testing:** Pushing the system beyond its expected limits to identify breaking points.
* **Soak Testing:** Running the system under sustained load for an extended period to identify potential memory leaks or other performance degradation over time.


These performance requirements provide a foundation for building a robust and scalable ADPA application.  Regular performance monitoring and testing are crucial to ensure the system continues to meet the evolving needs of its users.  Specific thresholds and targets may need adjustment based on further testing and user feedback.
