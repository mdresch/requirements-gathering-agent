## ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework: Performance Requirements

This document outlines the performance requirements for the ADPA framework, encompassing various aspects from API response times to overall system scalability.  These requirements are crucial for ensuring ADPA meets the needs of large-scale enterprise deployments and maintains high availability.

**1. Performance Goals:**

* **Overall System Availability:**  99.99% uptime (4 nines)  This ensures minimal disruption to business operations.
* **Document Generation Time:**  The average time to generate a document (of varying complexity) should not exceed:
    * **Small Documents (e.g., project charter):**  < 5 seconds
    * **Medium Documents (e.g., stakeholder analysis):** < 15 seconds
    * **Large Documents (e.g., comprehensive business case):** < 60 seconds
* **API Response Time:**  The average response time for API requests should not exceed:
    * **GET requests:** < 200ms
    * **POST requests (document generation):**  < 1 second (small documents), < 5 seconds (medium documents), < 30 seconds (large documents)

**2. Response Time Requirements:**

These times are measured from the point of request initiation to the complete delivery of the response, including network latency.  Percentile values (e.g., 95th percentile) should be tracked to identify outliers and potential bottlenecks.  Specific response time requirements for individual API endpoints will be documented separately.

**3. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Concurrent Users:** The system should comfortably handle a minimum of 100 concurrent users during peak hours, with the ability to scale horizontally to accommodate future growth.
* **Documents Generated per Hour:**  The system should be capable of generating a minimum of 1000 documents per hour during peak load.  This will need to be scaled based on average document size and complexity.
* **API Requests per Second:** The API should handle a minimum of 100 requests per second during peak load.

**4. Scalability Requirements:**

* **Horizontal Scalability:** The system architecture must support horizontal scaling (adding more servers) to handle increased load without impacting performance.
* **Database Scalability:** The underlying database (or data store) must be capable of scaling to accommodate a growing volume of documents and user data.  Specific database performance benchmarks will be defined based on the chosen technology.
* **AI Provider Integration Scalability:**  The integration with multiple AI providers must handle peak demand from concurrent document generation requests.  Failover mechanisms must ensure continuous availability even if one provider experiences temporary issues.

**5. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU Utilization:**  Average CPU utilization across all servers should remain below 70% during peak load.
* **Memory Utilization:** Average memory utilization should remain below 70% during peak load.
* **Disk I/O:**  Average disk I/O should remain below 80% during peak load.
* **Network Bandwidth:** Sufficient network bandwidth must be available to handle the data transfer associated with document generation and API communication.

**6. Load Handling:**

The system should gracefully handle peak loads without performance degradation.  Strategies for load balancing and request queuing will be implemented to ensure responsiveness even during periods of high demand.  Stress testing will be performed to determine the system's breaking point and to identify potential areas for optimization.

**7. Caching Strategy:**

An effective caching strategy will be implemented to reduce database load and improve response times.  Caching mechanisms should be used for frequently accessed data such as document templates, API specifications, and static content.  Cache invalidation strategies must be carefully designed to ensure data consistency.

**8. Performance Metrics:**

The following metrics will be continuously monitored:

* **Response times (percentiles):**  Average, 95th, and 99th percentile response times for API requests and document generation.
* **Throughput:** Documents generated per hour, API requests per second, concurrent users.
* **Resource utilization:** CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth utilization.
* **Error rates:**  Number of failed requests and document generation attempts.
* **Latency:** Network latency between different system components.


**9. Monitoring Requirements:**

A comprehensive monitoring system will be implemented to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and to provide alerts for potential performance issues.  This system should include dashboards, reporting tools, and automated alerts.  Specific monitoring tools will be selected based on their capabilities and integration with the existing infrastructure.

**10. Performance Testing Plan:**

A thorough performance testing plan will be developed and executed. This plan will include:

* **Load testing:** Simulating realistic user loads to assess system performance under stress.
* **Stress testing:** Pushing the system beyond its expected limits to determine its breaking point.
* **Endurance testing:** Running the system under sustained load for an extended period to identify stability issues.
* **Spike testing:** Simulating sudden surges in traffic to assess the system's ability to handle unexpected peaks.

The results of performance testing will be used to identify bottlenecks, optimize the system, and ensure it meets the specified performance requirements.  Regular performance testing will be conducted to ensure continued performance as the system evolves.
