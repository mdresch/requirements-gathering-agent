## Performance Requirements: Project Backup Vermigerous

These performance requirements outline the expected behavior of the Project Backup Vermigerous system, focusing on automation, secure recovery, and overall efficiency.  They are designed to ensure the system meets its objectives of providing reliable, timely, and secure backups.

**1. Performance Goals:**

* **Backup Completion Time:** Monthly backups should complete within [X] hours.  This should be measured from the initiation of the backup process to its successful completion, including validation.  [X] should be a realistically achievable time based on the size of the data being backed up and the available resources.  Consider setting different time limits for incremental/differential backups versus full backups.
* **Restore Time Objective (RTO):**  The system should be able to restore a full backup within [Y] hours. This is a critical metric for business continuity. [Y] should align with business recovery requirements.  Consider specifying RTOs for different data subsets or critical applications.
* **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** The maximum acceptable data loss in the event of a system failure should not exceed [Z] hours. This defines the acceptable window of data loss. [Z] should be determined based on business tolerance for data loss.  This is closely tied to the backup frequency (monthly in this case).  Consider stricter RPOs for critical data.
* **Storage Space Utilization:** The total storage space consumed by backups should not exceed [W] TB (or appropriate unit) at any given time. This requires a strategy for managing backup retention and potentially leveraging incremental/differential backups.
* **Backup Success Rate:** The system should achieve a backup success rate of at least 99.9%. This metric tracks the percentage of successful backup completions without errors.  Failures should be logged and investigated.
* **Restore Success Rate:** The system should achieve a restore success rate of at least 99.9%. This metric tracks the percentage of successful restores without data corruption or incompleteness.  Failures should be logged and investigated.


**2. Response Time Requirements:**

* **Backup Initiation:** The system should initiate backups within [A] minutes of the scheduled time.
* **Backup Status Queries:** Queries for backup status should return within [B] seconds.
* **Restore Initiation:** The system should initiate restores within [C] minutes of the request.
* **Metadata Retrieval:** Retrieving backup metadata (date, time, version, checksums) should take less than [D] seconds.

**3. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Backup Throughput:** The system should achieve a minimum backup throughput of [E] GB/hour. This depends on the network bandwidth, storage performance, and the size of the data.
* **Restore Throughput:** The system should achieve a minimum restore throughput of [F] GB/hour.

**4. Scalability Requirements:**

* **Data Growth:** The system should be able to handle an increase in data volume up to [G] TB within [H] years without significant performance degradation.  This requires a well-defined scaling strategy.
* **Concurrent Operations:** The system should be able to handle [I] concurrent backup and restore operations without significant performance impact.

**5. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU Utilization:** During backup and restore operations, CPU utilization should remain below [J]% on the backup server.
* **Memory Utilization:** During backup and restore operations, memory utilization should remain below [K]% on the backup server.
* **Network Bandwidth:** Network bandwidth utilization during backups should remain below [L]% of available bandwidth.
* **Disk I/O:** Disk I/O should remain below [M]% during peak backup/restore operations.

**6. Load Handling:**

* The system should be able to handle [N] simultaneous backup jobs without impacting performance.
* The system should be able to handle [O] simultaneous restore jobs without impacting performance.

**7. Caching Strategy:** (If applicable)

* A caching strategy should be implemented to improve the performance of frequently accessed backup metadata.  Define the cache size and eviction policy.

**8. Performance Metrics:**

* All performance metrics should be logged and monitored using [P] (e.g., Azure Monitor, Prometheus).
* Key metrics should be displayed on a dashboard for easy monitoring.

**9. Monitoring Requirements:**

* The system should provide real-time monitoring of backup and restore operations, including progress, status, and error messages.  Specify the frequency of monitoring (e.g., every minute).
* Alerts should be triggered for critical events such as backup failures, restore failures, exceeding resource utilization thresholds, and storage space nearing capacity.

**10. Performance Testing Plan:**

* A performance testing plan should be developed and executed to validate the system's performance against these requirements.  The plan should include load testing, stress testing, and recovery testing scenarios.

**Note:**  Replace the bracketed values ([X], [Y], [Z], etc.) with specific, measurable targets relevant to the Project Backup Vermigerous environment and business needs.  Consider using industry standard benchmarks as a starting point for defining these values.  The chosen metrics and thresholds should be regularly reviewed and adjusted as needed.
