## Performance Requirements for Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

This document outlines the performance requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) application, focusing on measurable metrics, baseline requirements, scalability, resource constraints, and monitoring needs.  The requirements are categorized to improve clarity and maintainability.

**1. Performance Goals:**

The primary goal is to provide a responsive and scalable system capable of handling a growing number of requests while maintaining acceptable performance levels.  The system should be designed for high availability and minimal downtime.  Specific goals include:

* **Document Generation Speed:**  Generate PMBOK-compliant documents within a specified timeframe (see Section 2).
* **API Response Time:** Maintain consistent and low response times for all API endpoints (see Section 2).
* **Scalability:**  Handle a projected increase in user base and document generation requests (see Section 4).
* **Resource Efficiency:** Minimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, network I/O) to optimize cost and performance (see Section 5).
* **High Availability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime.


**2. Response Time Requirements:**

The following response time requirements apply to various API endpoints under normal load conditions (defined as average daily usage):

| Endpoint Category          | Response Time (ms) | Baseline (ms) | Acceptable Degradation (%) |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Health Check               | < 100                 | < 50             | 20                        |
| Template Listing            | < 500                 | < 250            | 30                        |
| Template Creation           | < 2000                | < 1000           | 40                        |
| Document Conversion (small) | < 5000                | < 2500           | 50                        |
| Document Conversion (large) | < 15000               | < 7500           | 60                        |
| Document Jobs Listing       | < 500                 | < 250            | 30                        |


**Baseline (ms)** represents the target response time achieved during initial testing.  **Acceptable Degradation (%)** defines the maximum allowable increase in response time before triggering performance investigation.  Larger documents will naturally take longer to process; these times are estimates and should be refined during performance testing.

**3. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Documents Generated per Hour:**  The system should be able to generate at least X documents per hour under normal load conditions.  This number needs to be defined based on projected usage.
* **API Requests per Second:** The system should handle at least Y API requests per second under normal load conditions.  This number needs to be defined based on projected usage.


**4. Scalability Requirements:**

The RGA should be designed to scale horizontally to accommodate future growth. This includes:

* **Horizontal Scalability:**  The system architecture should support adding more instances of the application to handle increased load.
* **Database Scalability:** The database should be capable of handling increased data volume and concurrent access.  Consider using a horizontally scalable database solution.
* **Load Balancing:** Implement a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple application instances.


**5. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU Utilization:**  Average CPU utilization should remain below 70% under normal load.
* **Memory Utilization:** Average memory utilization should remain below 80% under normal load.
* **Disk I/O:**  Average disk I/O should remain within acceptable limits to prevent bottlenecks.  Monitoring disk space usage is crucial.
* **Network I/O:**  Monitor network bandwidth usage and ensure sufficient capacity to handle peak loads.


**6. Load Handling:**

The system should gracefully handle peak loads without significant performance degradation.  Strategies for handling peak loads should include:

* **Queuing System:** Implement a queuing system to handle requests exceeding immediate processing capacity.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect the system from denial-of-service attacks.


**7. Caching Strategy:**

Implement a caching strategy to reduce the load on the backend systems and improve response times.  Consider caching:

* **Frequently accessed templates:** Cache compiled templates to avoid repeated compilation.
* **API responses:**  Cache responses from external API calls (e.g., AI providers) where appropriate.


**8. Performance Metrics:**

The following performance metrics will be monitored:

* **Response times for all API endpoints**
* **Throughput (requests per second, documents generated per hour)**
* **Error rates**
* **CPU utilization**
* **Memory utilization**
* **Disk I/O**
* **Network I/O**
* **Queue lengths (if applicable)**


**9. Monitoring Requirements:**

Implement comprehensive monitoring to track performance metrics and detect potential issues proactively.  Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog are recommended.  Alerting should be configured for critical thresholds (e.g., high CPU utilization, slow response times, high error rates).


**10. Performance Testing Plan:**

A comprehensive performance testing plan will be developed and executed.  This plan will include:

* **Load testing:** Simulate high loads to assess the system's capacity and identify bottlenecks.
* **Stress testing:**  Push the system beyond its expected limits to determine its breaking point.
* **Endurance testing:**  Run the system under sustained load to identify any performance degradation over time.
* **Spike testing:** Simulate sudden bursts of traffic to assess the system's ability to handle unexpected spikes.


These performance requirements provide a foundation for building a robust and scalable RGA application.  Specific values (e.g., X, Y, response times) need to be determined based on detailed requirements gathering and capacity planning.  Regular performance testing and monitoring are crucial to ensuring the application continues to meet these requirements.
