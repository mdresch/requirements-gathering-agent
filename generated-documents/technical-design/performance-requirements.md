## Performance Requirements for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

These performance requirements are designed to ensure the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent meets the needs of a Fortune 500 enterprise environment, balancing responsiveness, scalability, and resource efficiency.  They are categorized for clarity and address various aspects of the system's performance.

**I. Response Time Requirements:**

* **API Endpoint Response Time:**  All API endpoints (`/api/v1/documents/convert`, `/api/v1/documents/jobs`, `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`, `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}`, etc.) should return a response within **2 seconds** under normal load (defined as 10 concurrent users).  This includes the time taken for processing and data retrieval.  For the `/api/v1/documents/convert` endpoint, the generation time of the BABOK framework should be under **2 seconds** for documents up to 500 lines. Larger documents should have proportionate scaling of response time, with a maximum acceptable response time of 10 seconds for documents up to 2000 lines. Beyond that, progress updates should be provided to the user.
* **Health Check Endpoint:** The `/api/v1/health` endpoint should respond within **100 milliseconds**.

**II. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Requests per Second (RPS):** The system should be capable of handling at least **100 RPS** under peak load (defined as 100 concurrent users) without significant performance degradation.  This should be tested with a mix of different API endpoints to simulate real-world usage.
* **Documents Generated per Hour:** The system should be able to generate at least **1000 BABOK v3 compliant documents** per hour under peak load.  The average document size should be considered in this metric.

**III. Scalability Requirements:**

* **Horizontal Scalability:** The system architecture should support horizontal scaling to accommodate increasing user load and document generation demands.  This should be achieved through a microservices-based approach or other scalable deployment strategies.
* **Load Balancing:** A load balancing mechanism should be implemented to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of the API server.
* **Database Scalability:** The database should be capable of handling the expected data volume and query load.  Consider using a database solution that supports horizontal scaling, such as a distributed database.

**IV. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU Utilization:** Average CPU utilization should remain below **70%** under peak load.
* **Memory Utilization:** Average memory utilization should remain below **80%** under peak load.
* **Disk I/O:** Disk I/O should be optimized to minimize latency and ensure efficient data access.  Consider using SSDs for improved performance.
* **Network I/O:** Network bandwidth usage should be monitored and optimized to prevent bottlenecks.

**V. Load Handling:**

* **Graceful Degradation:**  In case of overload, the system should gracefully degrade performance rather than crashing.  This could involve implementing queuing mechanisms, throttling, or circuit breakers.
* **Error Handling:**  Comprehensive error handling should be in place to manage exceptions and prevent system failures.  Detailed error messages should be returned to the client.

**VI. Caching Strategy:**

* **Response Caching:** Implement response caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response time.  Consider using a distributed caching solution.
* **Template Caching:**  Cache frequently used templates to reduce processing time.

**VII. Performance Metrics:**

* **Response Time (Latency):** Measured for each API endpoint.
* **Throughput (RPS):** Measured for the entire system.
* **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests.
* **CPU Utilization:**  Monitored at the server level.
* **Memory Utilization:** Monitored at the server level.
* **Disk I/O:** Monitored at the server level.
* **Network I/O:** Monitored at the server level.
* **Database Query Time:** Measured for database operations.

**VIII. Monitoring Requirements:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring of key performance metrics using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
* **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify the operations team of performance issues.
* **Logging:** Implement comprehensive logging to track system events and diagnose problems.

**IX. Performance Testing Plan:**

* **Load Testing:** Conduct load tests using tools like JMeter or Gatling to simulate various levels of user load and identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Stress Testing:** Conduct stress tests to push the system beyond its normal operating limits and assess its ability to handle extreme conditions.
* **Endurance Testing:** Conduct endurance tests to evaluate the system's stability over extended periods of time.

**X. Baseline Requirements:**

* The initial performance testing should establish a baseline against which future performance can be measured.  This baseline will be used to track improvements and identify regressions.


These performance requirements are intended to be a starting point and may need to be adjusted based on further testing and analysis.  Regular performance testing and monitoring are crucial to ensure the ongoing performance of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.
