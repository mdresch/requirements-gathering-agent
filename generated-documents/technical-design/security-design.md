# Security Design Document

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Author:** Bard (Security Architect)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security design for the ADPA application, focusing on protecting sensitive data, ensuring system integrity, and maintaining user confidentiality.  ADPA's unique functionality, leveraging AI and accessing potentially sensitive project data, necessitates a robust security architecture.


## 2. Security Overview

ADPA's security posture is built upon the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) and incorporates defense-in-depth principles.  Key security considerations include:

* **Data Confidentiality:** Protecting project data ingested by ADPA, including sensitive business information, intellectual property, and stakeholder details.
* **Data Integrity:** Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of generated documents and preventing unauthorized modification.
* **System Availability:** Maintaining ADPA's operational uptime and resilience against attacks and failures.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Securely identifying and verifying users and controlling their access to functionalities and data.
* **Data Protection:** Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
* **Threat Modeling:** Identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities and threats.
* **Security Testing:** Regularly testing the application's security through penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.
* **Incident Response:** Establishing procedures to handle security incidents effectively.


## 3. Authentication Design

ADPA will utilize several authentication methods depending on the deployment context:

* **Azure Entra ID (Recommended):**  Integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) provides strong authentication and authorization capabilities, leveraging existing enterprise identities. This is the preferred method for enterprise deployments.  This leverages OAuth 2.0 for secure token exchange.

* **API Keys (for specific APIs):**  For accessing external APIs (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI), API keys will be used, stored securely in environment variables, and rotated regularly.  Rate limiting and usage monitoring will be implemented.

* **Local Authentication (Development/Testing):** For development and testing environments, a less stringent local authentication mechanism might be used, but this should be replaced with a production-ready solution before deployment.


## 4. Authorization Framework

Access control will be implemented using role-based access control (RBAC):

* **Administrator:** Full access to all ADPA functionalities, including configuration, management, and monitoring.
* **User:** Access limited to document generation and viewing based on project permissions.  Project-level access controls will be implemented.

Authorization will be enforced at multiple layers:

* **API Gateway (if applicable):**  An API gateway can filter requests based on user roles and permissions.
* **Application Layer:** The ADPA application will validate user permissions before executing actions.
* **Database Layer:** Database access will be controlled using appropriate privileges.


## 5. Data Protection

* **Data at Rest:** Data stored in the database will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
* **Data in Transit:** Data transmitted between components and services will be protected using HTTPS with TLS 1.3 or higher.
* **Data Minimization:** ADPA will only collect and process the minimum amount of data necessary to fulfill its functionality.
* **Data Retention:**  A data retention policy will be defined and implemented to manage the lifecycle of project data.


## 6. Network Security

* **Secure Network Configuration:** ADPA will be deployed on a secure network with appropriate firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and network segmentation.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  The network infrastructure will be kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular vulnerability scans of the network infrastructure will be performed.


## 7. Security Controls

* **Input Validation:**  All user inputs will be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
* **Output Encoding:**  All outputs will be properly encoded to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of security controls.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Detailed logs of all activities will be maintained for security monitoring and incident response.  Centralized log management will be implemented.
* **Vulnerability Management:** A vulnerability management process will be established to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities.


## 8. Threat Modeling

A comprehensive threat modeling exercise will be conducted to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  The STRIDE threat model will be used:

* **Spoofing:**  Preventing unauthorized impersonation of users or systems.
* **Tampering:**  Protecting against unauthorized modification of data or system components.
* **Repudiation:**  Ensuring accountability for actions performed within the system.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Mitigating DoS attacks to ensure system availability.
* **Elevation of Privilege:**  Preventing unauthorized escalation of privileges.


## 9. Security Testing Strategy

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Analyzing the source code for vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Testing the running application for vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.
* **Security Scanning:**  Regularly scanning the application and infrastructure for known vulnerabilities.


## 10. Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan will be developed and regularly tested to handle security incidents effectively.  The plan will include procedures for:

* **Incident Detection:**  Identifying security incidents.
* **Incident Response:**  Responding to security incidents.
* **Incident Recovery:**  Recovering from security incidents.
* **Post-Incident Activity:**  Learning from security incidents to prevent future occurrences.


## 11. Compliance Requirements

ADPA will comply with relevant security and privacy regulations, including but not limited to:

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  If processing personal data from EU residents.
* **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):**  If processing personal data from California residents.
* **Other relevant regulations:**  Depending on the location of data processing and storage.


## 12. Future Considerations

* **AI Security:**  As AI technologies evolve, continuous monitoring and adaptation of security practices are crucial.  Addressing potential biases and vulnerabilities in the AI models themselves is important.
* **Third-Party Risk Management:**  If ADPA integrates with third-party services, a robust third-party risk management program will be necessary.
* **Zero Trust Security:**  Implementing a zero-trust security model will enhance the overall security posture.


This document provides a high-level overview of the security design for ADPA.  More detailed design specifications will be developed as the project progresses.  Regular security reviews and updates to this document will be conducted to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the security architecture.
