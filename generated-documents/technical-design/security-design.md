# Security Design Document: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Security Architect


## 1. Security Overview

ADPA is a modular framework handling sensitive data and integrating with various external services.  This necessitates a robust security posture encompassing authentication, authorization, data protection, network security, and incident response.  The design prioritizes a layered security approach, adhering to industry best practices and relevant regulations (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS, etc., as specified by client).  The system will be designed with a zero-trust security model in mind.

## 2. Authentication Design

ADPA will utilize a multi-layered authentication scheme:

* **Enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) Integration:** Primary authentication will leverage Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) for centralized identity management and single sign-on (SSO). This provides strong authentication, multi-factor authentication (MFA) capabilities, and integration with existing enterprise security infrastructure.  This will be the primary method for accessing the ADPA API and web interface.

* **API Key Authentication (Limited Use):**  For non-production environments and specific integrations where Entra ID integration isn't feasible, API keys will be used with strict access controls and short lifespans.  API keys will be managed and rotated regularly.

* **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):**  Once authenticated via Entra ID or API key, JWTs will be issued for subsequent requests, streamlining authentication flow and reducing overhead.  Tokens will have short lifespans and incorporate appropriate claims.

## 3. Authorization Framework

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Access control will be implemented using RBAC, defining distinct roles (e.g., Administrator, Business Analyst, Project Manager, User) with granular permissions.  Roles will be mapped to Entra ID groups for seamless integration.

* **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** For finer-grained control, ABAC will supplement RBAC, allowing access decisions based on attributes like data sensitivity, user location, and device context.

* **Least Privilege Principle:**  Users will be granted only the minimum necessary privileges to perform their tasks.

* **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  ACLs will be used at the data level to restrict access to sensitive documents and information.

## 4. Data Protection

* **Data Encryption:** Data at rest and in transit will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 or higher for data in transit). Encryption keys will be managed securely using a key management system (KMS).

* **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):**  Implement DLP measures to prevent sensitive data from leaving the system unauthorized.  This will include monitoring, alerting, and blocking capabilities.

* **Data Masking/Anonymization:** For development and testing, data masking or anonymization techniques will be used to protect sensitive information.

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Robust input validation and sanitization will be implemented to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.).

* **Secure Storage:** Sensitive configuration data (API keys, database credentials, etc.) will be stored securely using environment variables and a secure secrets management service.

## 5. Network Security

* **Secure Network Configuration:**  The ADPA infrastructure will be configured to adhere to secure network principles, including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and regular security audits.

* **Network Segmentation:**  Network segmentation will isolate different components of the system to limit the impact of a potential breach.

* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):**  Deploying ADPA within a VPC will enhance security by isolating the infrastructure from the public internet.

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF will be deployed to protect the web interface and API from common web attacks.

## 6. Security Controls

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.

* **Vulnerability Management:**  A vulnerability management program will be implemented to track and remediate identified vulnerabilities.

* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  A SIEM system will be used to centralize security logs and monitor for suspicious activity.

* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Comprehensive logging and monitoring will be implemented to track system activity and detect security incidents.

* **Security Training:**  Security awareness training will be provided to all personnel involved in the development and operation of ADPA.


## 7. Threat Modeling

A comprehensive threat model will be developed using the STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege) to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  This will inform the design and implementation of security controls.

## 8. Security Testing Strategy

A multi-faceted security testing strategy will be employed, including:

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Analyze source code for vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Test the running application for vulnerabilities.
* **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):**  Combine SAST and DAST for comprehensive testing.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.

## 9. Incident Response Plan

A detailed incident response plan will be developed and regularly tested to ensure a swift and effective response to security incidents.  The plan will include procedures for detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity.

## 10. Compliance Requirements

ADPA's design will ensure compliance with all relevant regulations, including but not limited to:

* **GDPR:**  Data privacy and protection.
* **SOX:**  Financial reporting compliance.
* **PCI DSS:**  Payment card industry data security standard (if applicable).
* **Basel III & MiFID II:**  Financial regulations (if applicable).
* **FINRA:**  Financial industry regulatory authority regulations (if applicable).


This Security Design Document provides a high-level overview.  More detailed specifications will be developed for each component and integrated into the overall system architecture.  Regular reviews and updates to this document will ensure it remains current and relevant.
