## Security Design Document: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Security Architect


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the security design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a Node.js application utilizing various AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to generate project documentation.  The design focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application, user data (if applicable), and the generated documents.  This document addresses security concerns related to the application's functionality, data handling, and interaction with external services.

**2. Security Goals**

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive user data (API keys, project information) and generated documents from unauthorized access.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the application and generated documents, preventing unauthorized modification or deletion.
* **Availability:** Maintain the application's operational status and accessibility to authorized users, mitigating denial-of-service attacks and other disruptions.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, industry-specific compliance requirements).


**3. Threat Modeling**

The following threats and vulnerabilities have been identified:

| Threat Category | Specific Threat | Vulnerability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Data Breaches** | Unauthorized access to API keys | Hardcoded API keys, insecure storage of credentials | Exposure of sensitive information, unauthorized access to AI services | Use environment variables, secure key management services (e.g., Azure Key Vault), least privilege access |
| **Data Breaches** | Unauthorized access to project data uploaded by users | Insufficient input validation, lack of data encryption | Exposure of sensitive project information | Input validation and sanitization, encryption of data at rest and in transit |
| **Data Breaches** | Unauthorized access to generated documents | Insecure file storage, lack of access control | Exposure of sensitive project information | Secure file storage (e.g., cloud storage with access control), encryption of sensitive documents |
| **Injection Attacks** | SQL injection, command injection | Improper input handling, insecure command execution | Data corruption, system compromise | Parameterized queries, input validation and sanitization, escaping special characters |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | Resource exhaustion attacks (CPU, memory) | Lack of rate limiting, resource exhaustion vulnerabilities | Application unavailability | Rate limiting, resource monitoring, circuit breakers |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** | Malicious scripts injected into generated documents | Lack of output encoding | User data compromise, session hijacking | Output encoding, Content Security Policy (CSP) |
| **API Abuse** | Excessive API calls | Lack of rate limiting, insufficient authentication | AI provider cost escalation, application instability | Rate limiting, API key management, monitoring of API usage |
| **Supply Chain Attacks** | Compromised dependencies | Use of outdated or vulnerable packages | Application compromise | Regular dependency updates, use of a dependency vulnerability scanner |
| **Unauthorized Access** | Brute-force attacks against CLI authentication | Weak password policies, lack of rate limiting | Unauthorized access to the application | Strong password policies, rate limiting, account lockout mechanisms |


**4. Security Controls**

* **Authentication:**  The CLI will utilize environment variables to securely store API keys.  Consider exploring user authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth 2.0) for future releases if user accounts are introduced.
* **Authorization:** Access control will be implemented based on environment variables and CLI arguments, ensuring only authorized users or processes can access specific functionality.
* **Input Validation & Sanitization:** All user inputs will be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Encoding:** All output generated by the application will be appropriately encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data (API keys, potentially user-uploaded project data) will be encrypted at rest and in transit. Encryption algorithms will be chosen based on industry best practices and compliance requirements.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Rate limits will be implemented to protect against DoS attacks and to prevent abuse of AI provider APIs.
* **Dependency Management:** Regular security scans will be performed on project dependencies using tools like Snyk or npm audit to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Security Testing:** Regular penetration testing and security audits will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring will be implemented to detect and respond to security incidents.  Logs will include timestamps, user activity, API calls, and error messages.
* **Incident Response Plan:** A documented incident response plan will outline procedures for handling security incidents, including escalation paths and communication protocols.
* **Compliance:** The application will be designed and implemented in accordance with relevant security and privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).


**5. Data Protection**

* **Data Minimization:** Only necessary data will be collected and processed.
* **Data Retention:** Data retention policies will be defined and implemented to ensure compliance with regulations.
* **Data Disposal:** Secure methods for data disposal will be used when data is no longer needed.


**6. Network Security**

* **Secure Communication:** Secure communication protocols (HTTPS) will be used for all external communication.
* **Network Segmentation:**  If applicable, network segmentation will be implemented to isolate the application from other systems.
* **Firewall:** A firewall will be used to control network access to the application.


**7. Deployment Considerations**

* **Secure Infrastructure:** The application will be deployed on a secure infrastructure (e.g., cloud platform with appropriate security controls).
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regular vulnerability scans will be performed on the deployment environment.
* **Security Hardening:** The deployment environment will be hardened to minimize the attack surface.


**8. Future Enhancements**

* Implement a robust vulnerability management program.
* Integrate with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized security monitoring.
* Explore the use of runtime application self-protection (RASP) technologies.


**9. Appendix**

This section will include detailed specifications on chosen encryption algorithms, security protocols, and other relevant technical details.


This Security Design Document provides a high-level overview of the security architecture for ADPA.  Further details will be provided in subsequent design and implementation documents.  This document will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the application and the threat landscape.
