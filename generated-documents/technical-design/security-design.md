## Security Design Document

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Author:** Security Architect


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the security design for the ADPA application, focusing on protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and its data.  Given ADPA's reliance on sensitive user data (API keys for various AI providers) and its generation of potentially sensitive project documentation, a robust security posture is paramount.  The design prioritizes defense in depth, employing multiple layers of security controls.

**2. Security Goals**

* **Confidentiality:** Protect API keys, user data, and generated project documents from unauthorized access.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and completeness of generated documents and prevent unauthorized modification.
* **Availability:** Maintain the availability of the ADPA application and its services.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., industry best practices, potential future regulatory requirements depending on data processed).


**3. Threat Model**

The following threats have been identified:

| Threat Agent | Threat Vector | Threat Type | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unauthorized User | Network attack (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) | Data Breach, Data Modification | Loss of confidentiality and integrity | Input validation, output encoding, secure coding practices, Web Application Firewall (WAF) |
| Malicious Insider | Unauthorized access to source code/deployment environment | Data Breach, Data Modification, Denial of Service | Loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability | Access control, monitoring, code reviews, least privilege principle |
| Compromised AI Provider API | API key theft/exposure | Data Breach, Data Modification | Loss of confidentiality and integrity | Secure key management, rotation of API keys, monitoring for suspicious API activity |
| Denial of Service (DoS) attack | Flooding of requests | Denial of Service | Loss of availability | Rate limiting, DDoS mitigation techniques |
| Data Leakage | Accidental or intentional exposure of sensitive data | Data Breach | Loss of confidentiality | Data loss prevention (DLP) tools, secure storage, access control |


**4. Security Architecture**

ADPA's security architecture employs a layered approach:

**4.1. Application Layer:**

* **Input Validation:**  All user inputs (command-line arguments, environment variables) will be rigorously validated to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).  Input sanitization techniques will be employed.
* **Output Encoding:** All outputs will be properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  The application will be developed following secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities.  Regular code reviews and static/dynamic analysis will be conducted.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling will prevent information leakage and ensure graceful degradation in case of errors.  Error messages will not reveal sensitive information.


**4.2. Data Layer:**

* **Secure Key Management:** API keys for AI providers will be stored securely using environment variables and/or a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., Azure Key Vault).  Keys should be rotated regularly.
* **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data (if any is stored persistently) will be encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* **Access Control:** Access to the database (if applicable) will be restricted based on the principle of least privilege.


**4.3. Network Layer:**

* **Network Segmentation:**  If deployed in a cloud environment, the application will be isolated in its own virtual network (VNet) with appropriate network access control lists (ACLs).
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF will be deployed to protect against common web attacks.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  An IDS/IPS will monitor network traffic for malicious activity.


**4.4. Operational Layer:**

* **Monitoring and Logging:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring will be implemented to detect and respond to security incidents.  Logs will be regularly reviewed.
* **Vulnerability Management:** Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing will be performed to identify and remediate security weaknesses.
* **Incident Response Plan:** A detailed incident response plan will be developed and regularly tested.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  The application and its dependencies will be kept up-to-date with security patches.


**5. Authentication and Authorization**

* **Authentication:**  The application will leverage the authentication mechanisms provided by the chosen AI providers (e.g., Azure Entra ID, Google Cloud IAM).  API keys will be treated as credentials.  No direct user authentication is planned at this stage, but future versions could incorporate user accounts with appropriate authentication and authorization.
* **Authorization:**  Access control will be implemented to restrict access to sensitive resources based on the principle of least privilege.  This will primarily involve controlling access to API keys and generated documents.


**6. Data Protection**

* **Data Minimization:**  The application will only collect and process the minimum amount of data necessary to perform its functions.
* **Data Retention:**  A data retention policy will be defined to determine how long data will be stored.
* **Data Disposal:**  Secure methods will be used to dispose of data when it is no longer needed.


**7. Compliance Requirements**

Compliance requirements will be determined based on the specific regulations applicable to the data processed and the location of data storage.  This may include GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, or other relevant legislation.  Regular security assessments will ensure ongoing compliance.


**8. Security Testing Strategy**

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  SAST tools will be used to analyze the application code for vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  DAST tools will be used to test the running application for vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Penetration testing will be conducted by a qualified security professional to assess the overall security posture of the application.


**9. Incident Response Plan**

A comprehensive incident response plan will be developed, outlining procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.  This plan will include:

* **Incident identification and reporting**
* **Containment and eradication**
* **Recovery and restoration**
* **Post-incident activity**


**10. Future Considerations**

* **Integration with SIEM:** Integrate with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized security monitoring.
* **User Authentication:**  Implement user authentication and authorization for future versions.
* **Advanced Threat Protection:**  Explore advanced threat protection technologies as needed.


**11. Conclusion**

This security design document provides a comprehensive overview of the security measures planned for the ADPA application.  By implementing these controls, ADPA aims to mitigate identified threats and protect sensitive data while ensuring the application's availability and compliance with relevant regulations.  This document will be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves and new threats emerge.
