# ADPA (Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework)  
**Security Design Document**

---

## 1. Security Overview

**ADPA** is an enterprise-grade automation framework for document generation, project management, and business analysis, supporting both CLI and REST API interfaces. Security is a central architectural concern, with design patterns and controls to support regulatory compliance (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.), multi-tenant enterprise deployments, and integration with external systems (AI Providers, SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe, etc.).

**Key Security Objectives:**
- **Confidentiality:** Safeguard enterprise and client data at rest and in transit.
- **Integrity:** Prevent unauthorized or accidental modification of documents and templates.
- **Availability:** Ensure system and data accessibility for authorized users.
- **Accountability:** Maintain audit trails and traceability for all actions.
- **Compliance:** Meet requirements of GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, and other standards.
- **Extensibility:** Allow for secure integration with new providers and services.

## 2. Authentication Design

### 2.1 User Authentication

- **API:**  
  - **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for stateless authentication.  
    - Tokens signed with strong secret (ideally asymmetric keys in production).
    - Short token expiry with refresh token mechanism.
  - **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect:**  
    - For enterprise SSO (e.g., Azure AD, SAML, Active Directory).
    - Used for integrations (SharePoint, Confluence, Adobe APIs).
  - **API Key:**  
    - Available for automation and CLI users (least privileged, rotate regularly).
    - Sent via secure HTTP header (`X-API-Key`).

- **CLI:**  
  - Supports both API Key and interactive OAuth2 login for publishing/integration.
  - Secrets and tokens stored in encrypted configuration files or OS credential stores.

- **Admin Web Interface:**  
  - OAuth2-based authentication with enterprise SSO support.
  - Session tokens stored using `HttpOnly`, `Secure` cookies.

### 2.2 Provider Authentication

- **AI Providers:**  
  - API keys/secrets stored in environment variables or secure vaults.
  - No hard-coded credentials.  
  - Rate limits and usage monitoring enforced.

- **Integration Providers (Adobe, SharePoint, Confluence):**  
  - OAuth2 authorization code/device flow.
  - Least-privilege principle: only request required scopes.

**Best Practices:**  
- Enforce strong password policies and MFA where supported.
- Lock accounts after repeated failed attempts.
- Use secure storage for secrets (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.).

## 3. Authorization Framework

### 3.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **User Roles:**  
  - `admin`, `project_manager`, `business_analyst`, `stakeholder`, `viewer`.
- **Resource Permissions:**  
  - Fine-grained permissions on resources: `projects`, `documents`, `templates`, `users`, `integrations`.
- **API Enforcement:**  
  - All API endpoints validate JWT and user role before processing.
  - CLI commands check permissions before sensitive actions.
- **Approval Workflows:**  
  - For document publishing, changes, and project approvals.
- **Granular Audit Trail:**  
  - All permission changes, resource access, and critical operations are logged.

### 3.2 Integration Authorization

- **Delegated Permissions:**  
  - Only allow API integrations (SharePoint, Confluence) to access resources authorized for the current user.
- **Consent & Revocation:**  
  - Users can revoke integration consent at any time.

---

## 4. Data Protection

### 4.1 Data at Rest

- **Encryption:**  
  - All persistent storage (documents, templates, configs) encrypted at rest (AES-256).
  - Secrets and keys stored in secure vaults.
- **Database Security:**  
  - If using SQL/NoSQL, enforce encryption, strong access controls, and regular backups.
- **Document Storage:**  
  - Generated documents stored in isolated, access-controlled directories.

### 4.2 Data in Transit

- **TLS/SSL:**  
  - All network communications (API, CLI, integrations) require HTTPS with strong TLS (v1.2+).
  - Secure WebSocket (WSS) for real-time collaboration.

### 4.3 Sensitive Data Handling

- **Input Validation:**  
  - Strict validation (Joi, Zod, express-validator) for all API/CLI inputs.
- **Output Escaping:**  
  - Prevent XSS by escaping all user-controlled outputs in web/admin UI.
- **Secrets Redaction:**  
  - Never log or expose secrets/API keys in logs or error messages.

### 4.4 Data Retention and Disposal

- **Retention Policies:**  
  - Configurable data retention for generated documents and logs.
- **Secure Deletion:**  
  - Overwrite and delete sensitive files on removal.

---

## 5. Network Security

- **Perimeter Controls:**
  - Deploy behind firewalls and reverse proxies.
  - Use WAF (Web Application Firewall) for public endpoints.
- **IP Allowlisting:**
  - Restrict admin/API/CLI access to trusted networks.
- **Rate Limiting:**
  - `express-rate-limit` middleware to prevent brute-force and DoS attacks.
- **CORS:**
  - Restrictive CORS configuration, only allow trusted origins.
- **Helmet:**
  - Use `helmet` middleware for HTTP header hardening.

---

## 6. Security Controls

### 6.1 Application Controls

- **Input Sanitization:**  
  - All data entering the system is sanitized and validated.
- **Output Encoding:**  
  - All outputs to the UI or API responses are encoded to prevent injection attacks.
- **CSRF Protection:**  
  - CSRF tokens for admin web interface and API where appropriate.
- **Session Management:**  
  - Short-lived, signed, and encrypted tokens.  
  - Session expiration and forced logout on sensitive changes.

### 6.2 Logging & Monitoring

- **Secure Logging:**  
  - Use `winston` or similar for structured, tamper-resistant logs.
  - Logs include user, resource, action, timestamp, and outcome.
- **Monitoring:**  
  - Health checks, usage metrics, and anomaly detection (API abuse, suspicious logins).
- **Alerting:**  
  - Automated alerts for key events (failed logins, privilege escalations, integration failures).

### 6.3 Dependency & Code Security

- **Regular Dependency Scans:**  
  - Use tools (npm audit, Snyk) to detect vulnerable packages.
- **Static Code Analysis:**  
  - Enforce linting, type checking, and security rules in CI/CD.
- **Secure Coding Standards:**  
  - Adhere to OWASP Top 10, secure design principles, and code reviews.

## 10. Compliance Requirements

### 10.1 Data Privacy & Protection

- **GDPR:**  
  - Data minimization, right to erasure, DPA agreements with processors.
- **SOX:**  
  - Audit trails for document and process integrity.
- **PCI DSS:**  
  - If handling payment data, follow PCI DSS segmentation and encryption requirements.

### 10.2 Security Standards

- **ISO 27001:**  
  - Information security management system best practices.
- **NIST SP 800-53:**  
  - Control families mapped to access control, audit, and incident response.

### 10.3 Sector-Specific

- **Healthcare (HIPAA):**  
  - If handling PHI, ensure all administrative, physical, and technical safeguards are in place.
- **Financial (FINRA, Basel III, MiFID II):**  
  - Maintain records, access controls, and auditability as per sector mandates.

### 10.4 Auditability

- **Comprehensive Logging:**  
  - All sensitive and compliance-relevant actions are logged and retained as per policy.
- **Regular Reviews:**  
  - Scheduled compliance and security reviews.

## 11. Security Monitoring

- **Health Endpoints:**  
  - `/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/health/ready` for liveness/readiness with restricted sensitive info.
- **Metrics & Analytics:**  
  - Real-time usage monitoring, anomaly detection, and performance.
- **SIEM Integration:**  
  - Support for forwarding logs and events to SIEM tools.
- **Admin Dashboard:**  
  - Security alerts, audit trail review, and compliance status.

---

## 12. Security Patterns Used

- **Defense in Depth:**  
  - Multiple layers of controls (validation, RBAC, encryption, monitoring).
- **Least Privilege:**  
  - Users, services, and integrations only have permissions required for their purpose.
- **Fail Securely:**  
  - Default to deny, explicit allow rules.
- **Secure Defaults:**  
  - All services run with secure default configurations (no open admin endpoints, strong CORS, etc.).
- **Zero Trust:**  
  - Assume breach, verify each request, and minimize trust boundaries.
