# Security Design Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (Security Architect)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security design for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA), a production-ready Express.js API generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  The system processes sensitive enterprise data and requires robust security measures to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  This design prioritizes API security, data protection, and compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, etc. â€“ specific regulations to be determined based on client requirements and data location).


## 2. Security Goals

The primary security goals for ADPA-RGA are:

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive enterprise data from unauthorized access and disclosure.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and completeness of data and prevent unauthorized modification.
* **Availability:** Maintain the continuous operation of the system and prevent denial-of-service attacks.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant security regulations and industry best practices.
* **Accountability:** Track and audit all system activities to identify and address security incidents.


## 3. Security Architecture

The security architecture incorporates multiple layers of defense to mitigate various threats:

**3.1 Authentication and Authorization:**

* **API Key Authentication:**  The primary authentication method will be API keys, generated and managed within the system.  Keys will be associated with specific users or roles, enabling granular access control.  Key rotation and revocation mechanisms will be implemented.  Key length and generation will follow industry best practices.
* **JWT (JSON Web Token) Support:**  Consideration should be given to JWT for scenarios requiring more complex authentication flows, especially if integrating with other systems.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Fine-grained authorization will be implemented using RBAC.  Different roles (e.g., administrator, user, guest) will have different permissions to access specific API endpoints and functionalities.
* **Secure Key Management:** API keys will be stored securely using techniques such as encryption at rest and transit, and access will be restricted to authorized personnel only.  A secure key vault should be utilized.

**3.2 Data Protection:**

* **Input Validation:**  All input data will be rigorously validated using Zod schemas to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), etc.).
* **Output Encoding:**  Output data will be properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Data Encryption at Rest:** Sensitive data stored in databases or files will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* **Data Encryption in Transit:**  All communication between components and clients will be encrypted using HTTPS.
* **Data Minimization:** The system will only collect and process the minimum necessary data to perform its functions.
* **Data Retention Policy:** A clear data retention policy will be established and enforced.

**3.3 Network Security:**

* **Firewall:**  A firewall will be implemented to control network access to the system.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  Consider implementing an IDS/IPS to detect and prevent malicious network activity.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF will be deployed to protect the API from common web application attacks.

**3.4 Security Controls:**

* **Rate Limiting:**  Rate limiting will be implemented to prevent denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
* **Input Sanitization:**  All user inputs will be sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated vulnerability scanning will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Comprehensive logging and monitoring will be implemented to detect and respond to security incidents.  Centralized log management is recommended.

**3.5 Threat Modeling:**

A thorough threat modeling exercise will be conducted to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  This will inform the design and implementation of security controls.  STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege) will be used as a framework.

**3.6 Security Testing Strategy:**

* **Unit Testing:** Security considerations will be integrated into unit tests.
* **Integration Testing:**  Security tests will be performed to verify the interaction between different components.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Regular penetration testing will be conducted by external security experts.
* **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):** Automated tools will be used to identify vulnerabilities in the code and running application.


## 4. Compliance Requirements

The system will comply with all applicable regulations, including but not limited to:

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):**  If processing personal data from EU residents.
* **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act):** If processing personal data from California residents.
* **Other relevant regulations:**  Specific regulations will be determined based on the client's location and data processing activities.


## 5. Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan will be developed and regularly tested to ensure a swift and effective response to security incidents.  This plan will outline procedures for detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity.


## 6. Future Considerations

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Consider implementing MFA for enhanced authentication security.
* **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):**  If deploying to the cloud, utilize CSPM tools to monitor and manage cloud security posture.
* **Secrets Management:**  Utilize a dedicated secrets management system to securely store and manage sensitive information.


## 7. Appendix

This section will include detailed technical specifications, diagrams, and other relevant information.


This document provides a high-level overview of the security design for ADPA-RGA.  Further details will be elaborated upon during the design and implementation phases.  Regular security reviews and updates to this document are crucial to maintain a robust security posture.
