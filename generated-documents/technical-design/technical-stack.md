## Technical Stack Overview: Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA)

This document outlines the technical stack for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a sophisticated AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.  The architecture emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability to support ongoing feature development and adaptation to evolving AI landscapes.

**1. Frontend Technologies:**

* **None:** ADPA is primarily a command-line interface (CLI) tool. There's no dedicated frontend application.  The output is generated as markdown files, which can be rendered by various markdown viewers or integrated into other systems.

**2. Backend Technologies:**

* **Node.js (v18.0.0 or higher):**  The runtime environment provides a robust and efficient platform for server-side JavaScript execution.  Its large ecosystem of packages simplifies integration with various services.
* **TypeScript:**  Used for development, offering type safety, improved code maintainability, and enhanced developer experience.  This is crucial for a complex system with many interacting components.
* **Modular Architecture:** The core architecture employs a modular design with separate processors for each document type.  This promotes code reusability, simplifies maintenance, and allows for easy extension with new document types.  The `processor-config.json` file manages the registration and instantiation of these processors.


**3. Database Technologies:**

* **None:**  ADPA doesn't require a persistent database.  It operates on the provided project context and generates documents on demand.  The generated documents can be stored locally or in a version control system (VCS).

**4. Infrastructure Components:**

* **Azure (Recommended):** Azure OpenAI Service is the primary AI provider, leveraging GPT-4 and potentially other models.  This provides access to powerful language models and robust infrastructure.  Entra ID authentication is supported for secure access.
* **Google Cloud Platform (Alternative):** Google AI Studio and Gemini models provide an alternative AI provider, offering a competitive option with its own strengths.
* **GitHub AI (Alternative):** GitHub AI offers another alternative, suitable for those already integrated into the GitHub ecosystem.
* **Ollama (Alternative):** Ollama provides a local option for those who prefer on-premise AI model deployment.
* **Cloud Storage (Optional):** While not strictly required, cloud storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) could be integrated to store and manage generated documents at scale.

**5. Development Tools:**

* **npm:** The Node Package Manager is used for dependency management.
* **TypeScript Compiler:** Compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.
* **Jest:**  A comprehensive testing framework for unit and integration tests, ensuring code quality and reliability.
* **ESLint:**  A linter for maintaining consistent code style and identifying potential errors.


**6. Testing Tools:**

* **Jest:** As mentioned above, Jest is the primary testing framework, providing features for unit, integration, and performance testing.

**7. Monitoring Tools:**

* **Custom Logging:** ADPA incorporates custom logging to track execution, errors, and performance metrics. More sophisticated monitoring could be added (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for large-scale deployments.

**8. Deployment Tools:**

* **npm:**  The primary deployment mechanism, allowing users to install ADPA globally or locally using `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent` or `npx requirements-gathering-agent`.

**9. Version Control and CI/CD:**

* **Git:**  Used for version control.  ADPA also includes a built-in VCS for managing generated documents, allowing for tracking changes and reverting to previous versions.
* **CI/CD (Optional):**  While not explicitly defined, the modular architecture and comprehensive testing framework make integration with CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps) straightforward.


**10.  Justification of Technology Choices:**

* **Node.js and TypeScript:** Provide a fast, scalable, and maintainable backend. TypeScript enhances code quality and reduces errors.
* **Modular Architecture:** Promotes extensibility, maintainability, and independent development of document processors.
* **Multiple AI Providers:** Offers flexibility and resilience, allowing users to choose the best provider based on their needs and cost considerations.
* **CLI Interface:** Simple and efficient user interaction, suitable for integration into scripts and automation workflows.
* **Built-in VCS for Generated Documents:** Ensures traceability, auditability, and facilitates collaboration.


**11. Scalability Considerations:**

* **Modular Design:** Easily scales horizontally by adding more document processors or deploying multiple instances.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** The use of asynchronous operations helps manage concurrent requests efficiently.
* **Cloud-Based AI Providers:** Leverage the scalability of cloud services for AI processing.

**12. Maintainability:**

* **TypeScript:** Improves code readability and maintainability.
* **Modular Design:** Simplifies code changes and reduces the risk of unintended consequences.
* **Comprehensive Testing:** Ensures code quality and reduces the likelihood of regressions.
* **Clear Documentation:**  Facilitates onboarding and ongoing maintenance.


**13. Dependencies:**  The `package.json` file lists all dependencies and devDependencies.  Note that specific AI provider SDKs (@azure/openai, @google/generative-ai) are included based on the chosen provider.


This overview provides a comprehensive picture of ADPA's technical stack.  The choices reflect a commitment to building a robust, scalable, maintainable, and adaptable system capable of meeting the evolving demands of AI-powered project documentation.
