## Requirements Gathering Agent: Technical Stack Overview

This document outlines the technical stack for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, justifying technology choices and addressing scalability, maintainability, and dependencies.  The project's focus on AI-driven document generation, PMBOK compliance, and international footprint necessitates a robust and adaptable architecture.

**1. Frontend Technologies:**

* **None (Currently):** The current implementation is primarily backend-focused with a CLI interface.  A future iteration might incorporate a web UI.  If a web UI is developed, the following would be considered:
    * **React (or similar framework like Vue or Angular):** For building a responsive and interactive user interface.  Justification: Mature ecosystem, large community support, component-based architecture for maintainability.
    * **TypeScript:** To maintain type safety and improve code quality. Justification: Aligns with backend technology choice, enhances maintainability and reduces runtime errors.
    * **Material UI (or similar component library):** For pre-built UI components, accelerating development and ensuring consistency. Justification: Improves developer productivity and provides a consistent user experience.

**2. Backend Technologies:**

* **Node.js (v20.x):**  The runtime environment. Justification: Excellent performance, large npm ecosystem, strong support for asynchronous operations crucial for handling AI API calls.
* **Express.js (latest stable):** The web framework. Justification: Lightweight, flexible, and easy to integrate with other middleware.  Well-suited for building RESTful APIs.
* **TypeScript (latest stable):** The programming language. Justification: Enhances code maintainability, readability, and reduces runtime errors through static typing.  Crucial for a complex project like this.

**3. Database Technologies:**

* **NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB):**  For storing generated documents, templates, and user configurations. Justification:  Flexibility to handle semi-structured data and scalability for potential large datasets.  Relational databases might be considered if strict schema enforcement becomes critical in future iterations.

**4. Infrastructure Components:**

* **Cloud Provider (Azure preferred):**  Leveraging Azure's services for AI integration, storage, and deployment. Justification:  Alignment with existing dependencies (`@azure-rest/ai-inference`, `@azure/identity`, `@azure/openai`), seamless integration with Azure services, and scalability.  AWS or GCP could be considered as alternatives.
* **Containerization (Docker):**  For packaging and deploying the application consistently across different environments. Justification: Improved portability, consistency, and efficient resource utilization.
* **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes):**  For managing and scaling the application across multiple containers. Justification:  Handles the complexities of managing a distributed system, enhancing scalability and reliability.

**5. Development Tools:**

* **Visual Studio Code (or similar IDE):**  For code editing, debugging, and version control integration.
* **npm/yarn:** Package managers for managing project dependencies.
* **Git:**  For version control and collaborative development.


**6. Testing Tools:**

* **Jest:**  The testing framework. Justification: Widely adopted, well-integrated with Node.js and TypeScript, supports various testing types (unit, integration).
* **Supertest (or similar):** For API testing. Justification:  Simplifies testing of HTTP requests and responses.


**7. Monitoring Tools:**

* **Prometheus & Grafana (or similar):**  For monitoring application performance, resource utilization, and error rates. Justification: Provide real-time insights into the application's health and performance, crucial for identifying and resolving issues promptly.  Azure Monitor could also be used given the Azure infrastructure preference.


**8. Deployment Tools:**

* **Azure DevOps (or similar CI/CD pipeline):**  For automated building, testing, and deployment of the application. Justification:  Streamlines the deployment process, ensuring consistency and reducing manual errors.


**9. Version Control and CI/CD:**

* **Git (GitHub/Azure DevOps):**  For version control.
* **Azure DevOps (or similar CI/CD platform):**  For automated building, testing, and deployment.  Justification:  Enables continuous integration and continuous delivery, crucial for maintaining a high-quality and rapidly evolving application.


**10. Dependencies:**

The project's `package.json` already lists many dependencies, including:

* **AI Providers:**  `@azure-rest/ai-inference`, `@azure/identity`, `@azure/openai`, `@google/generative-ai`, `openai` (OpenAI API clients).
* **HTTP Clients:** `axios`, `node-fetch`.
* **Security:** `bcryptjs`, `compression`, `cors`, `helmet`, `jsonwebtoken`, `express-rate-limit`.
* **Logging:** `winston`, `express-winston`.
* **Validation:** `express-validator`, `joi`.
* **File Handling:** `form-data`, `glob`, `multer`.
* **Utilities:** `dotenv`, `uuid`.
* **Swagger:** `swagger-ui-express`.
* **Other:** `express`, `ts-node`.


**Justification of Choices & Scalability:**

The chosen technologies are designed for scalability. The use of a cloud provider (Azure preferred), containerization (Docker), and container orchestration (Kubernetes) allows the application to scale horizontally by adding more containers as needed.  The NoSQL database choice also provides flexibility and scalability for handling increasing data volumes. The modular architecture, promoted by TypeScript and Express.js, makes it easier to add new features and integrate with third-party tools in the future.

**Maintainability:**

TypeScript's strong typing and the use of well-structured frameworks like Express.js and Jest significantly improve code maintainability.  Comprehensive documentation and a well-defined testing strategy further enhance maintainability.  The modular design allows for easier updates and bug fixes.

This overview provides a solid foundation for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Further refinements might be needed based on evolving project requirements and feedback.
