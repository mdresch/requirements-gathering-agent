## Project Backup Vermigerous: Technical Stack Overview

This document outlines the technical stack for Project Backup Vermigerous, focusing on automation, secure recovery, and scalability.  The design prioritizes data integrity, efficient storage, and robust monitoring.

**1. Project Goals:** Automate monthly backups, ensure data integrity through validation, and provide secure, reliable recovery in case of system failure.  Backups are categorized by year and month.

**2. Technology Stack Justification:** The chosen technologies balance performance, security, cost-effectiveness, and ease of maintenance.  Azure services are leveraged for their scalability and managed services capabilities, reducing operational overhead.

**3. Technology Stack Overview:**

| Component Category          | Technology/Service                     | Justification                                                                                             | Version/Details                                   |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**                | None (This is a backend-focused project) | The backup process is primarily automated and runs without a user interface.                             |                                                    |
| **Backend**                 | Python (with appropriate libraries)     | Mature, versatile language suitable for automation tasks. Good library support for file handling, hashing, and cloud interaction. | Python 3.10+                                      |
|                             | Azure Automation                        | Enables scheduling and automation of backup tasks within the Azure ecosystem. Provides centralized management. | Latest stable version                               |
|                             | PowerShell (for specific tasks)          | Useful for interacting with Windows systems if the backup targets are Windows-based.                     | Latest stable version                               |
| **Database**                | None (metadata stored in JSON)         | For this project, a simple JSON file suffices for storing metadata.  A database could be added later if needed for more complex metadata management. |                                                    |
| **Storage**                 | Azure Blob Storage (with WORM)          | Cost-effective, scalable, and secure object storage. WORM (Write Once Read Many) ensures immutability of backups. | Latest stable version; WORM policy enabled         |
| **Encryption**              | AES-256 (at rest and in transit)        | Industry-standard encryption algorithm for strong data protection.                                        | Implementation using Azure Blob Storage encryption features and TLS for transport. |
| **Backup Strategy**         | Incremental/Differential Backups       | Minimizes storage space and backup time compared to full backups.                                        | Algorithm choice to be determined based on workload characteristics.  |
| **Validation & Integrity** | SHA-256 checksums                      | Provides strong data integrity verification.                                                              | Implemented before and after backup/restore operations. |
| **Scheduling**              | Azure Automation or cron jobs           | Reliable and flexible scheduling mechanisms.                                                              | Cron for Linux/macOS systems, Azure Automation for Windows and cross-platform scenarios. |
| **Monitoring & Alerting**   | Azure Monitor/Log Analytics             | Tracks backup status and generates alerts for failures or anomalies.                                      | Custom dashboards and alerts configured as needed.   |
| **Version Control**          | Git (e.g., GitHub, Azure DevOps)        | Tracks code changes and enables collaboration.                                                           |                                                    |
| **CI/CD**                   | Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions          | Automates the deployment and testing of backup scripts.                                                 | Pipeline to build, test, and deploy scripts.     |
| **Development Tools**       | VS Code, PyCharm                         | Popular IDEs for Python development.                                                                    |                                                    |
| **Testing Tools**           | Unit tests (pytest), Integration tests | Ensure the correctness and reliability of the backup and restore processes.                              |                                                    |
| **Deployment Tools**         | Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell             | Facilitate deployment of the backup solution to Azure.                                                  |                                                    |


**4. Scalability Considerations:**

* **Azure Blob Storage:**  Scales automatically to accommodate growing backup data.
* **Incremental/Differential Backups:**  Minimize storage growth over time.
* **Azure Automation:**  Can handle increased backup frequency or larger datasets with appropriate scaling configurations.


**5. Maintainability:**

* **Modular design:**  The backup scripts should be modular to improve maintainability and allow for future enhancements.
* **Version control:**  Using Git ensures trackability and facilitates collaboration.
* **Comprehensive documentation:**  This document and other relevant documentation will keep the system maintainable.


**6. Dependencies:**

* Python libraries:  `azure-storage-blob`, `hashlib`, `datetime`, and potentially others depending on specific implementation choices.


This technical stack provides a robust and scalable solution for Project Backup Vermigerous.  Further details on specific implementation choices (e.g., precise Azure services used, specific Python libraries) will be documented during the design and implementation phases.
