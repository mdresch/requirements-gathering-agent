## Technical Stack Overview: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the technical stack for ADPA, focusing on justifying technology choices, addressing scalability, maintainability, and versioning.  The stack is designed for robustness, extensibility, and efficient handling of large language models (LLMs).


**1. Frontend Technologies:**

* **None:** ADPA is primarily a command-line interface (CLI) application.  There is no dedicated frontend user interface (UI).  This simplifies deployment and maintenance, focusing resources on core functionality.  Future iterations *could* incorporate a web UI, potentially using a framework like React or Vue.js, depending on user needs.

**2. Backend Technologies:**

* **Node.js (v18.0.0+):**  Provides a robust and efficient JavaScript runtime environment for server-side logic.  Its large ecosystem of packages simplifies integration with various services.
* **TypeScript:**  Used for all backend code to ensure type safety, improve code maintainability, and reduce runtime errors.  This is crucial given the complexity of integrating with multiple AI providers and managing large amounts of project context.
* **Express.js (Optional, for future API):**  Could be used to create a RESTful API for future integrations with other systems.  Currently, the CLI is the primary interface.


**3. Database Technologies:**

* **None:**  ADPA doesn't rely on a persistent database for storing project data.  The context is dynamically assembled from project files during each execution.  This simplifies the architecture and avoids the overhead of database management.  A database could be considered for future features such as storing project history or user preferences.


**4. Infrastructure Components:**

* **Azure (Recommended):**  Leverages Azure OpenAI for LLM access and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication.  This provides a scalable and secure infrastructure for the application.  Alternatives include Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or AWS, depending on client preferences and existing infrastructure.
* **GitHub (Optional):**  Used for version control and collaboration.  The project utilizes GitHub Actions for CI/CD.


**5. AI Integration:**

* **Azure OpenAI:**  The primary LLM provider, offering access to GPT models (e.g., GPT-4).  Chosen for its robust capabilities, scalability, and integration with Azure AD.  The `@azure/openai` and `@azure/identity` packages handle secure API interactions.
* **Google AI (Gemini):**  Provides an alternative LLM provider, offering access to Gemini models. This allows for fallback options and comparison of model outputs.  The `@google/generative-ai` package manages the integration.
* **GitHub AI:**  Integrated for code generation and assistance, particularly beneficial during development.
* **Ollama (Local):**  Supports local LLM deployment for testing and development purposes.

**6. Development Tools:**

* **Visual Studio Code (or similar):**  Used for code editing and debugging.
* **npm/yarn:** Package managers for dependency management.
* **Git:**  Version control system.


**7. Testing Tools:**

* **Jest:**  A JavaScript testing framework for unit and integration tests.  Comprehensive testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the AI-generated documents.


**8. Monitoring Tools:**

* **None (currently):**  Basic logging is implemented, but dedicated monitoring tools are not currently used.  This could be added in the future to track application performance, error rates, and LLM usage.


**9. Deployment Tools:**

* **npm:**  Used for global installation of the CLI.
* **GitHub Actions:**  Automates the build, test, and deployment process.


**10. Version Control and CI/CD:**

* **Git:**  Used for version control, hosted on GitHub.
* **GitHub Actions:**  Implements CI/CD, automating the build, testing, and release process.  This ensures code quality and facilitates rapid iteration.


**Justification of Technology Choices:**

The chosen technologies prioritize scalability, maintainability, and integration with leading AI services.  TypeScript enhances code quality, while the modular architecture allows for easy extension and adaptation to future requirements.  The reliance on cloud-based AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI) ensures access to cutting-edge models and scalable infrastructure. The CLI-first approach simplifies deployment and user interaction.


**Scalability Considerations:**

The use of cloud-based AI services and a stateless architecture ensures that ADPA can scale to handle large projects and increasing user demand.  The modular design allows for easy horizontal scaling by adding more processing nodes if needed.


**Maintainability Considerations:**

The use of TypeScript, a modular architecture, and comprehensive testing ensures that the application is easy to maintain and extend.  The clear separation of concerns makes it simple to update individual components without impacting the entire system.


**Version Information:**

All dependencies are managed via `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, ensuring reproducibility and consistent builds.  The application itself is versioned using semantic versioning.

**Dependencies:**  The `README` lists all dependencies (both production and development).  Note that some packages might be indirectly included via other dependencies.


This overview provides a comprehensive picture of ADPA's technical stack. The choices made reflect a commitment to building a robust, scalable, and maintainable system capable of leveraging the power of LLMs for advanced document generation.
