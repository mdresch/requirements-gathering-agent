## Technical Stack Overview: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the technical stack for ADPA, justifying technology choices and addressing scalability, maintainability, and versioning.  ADPA is primarily a backend application with a CLI interface, generating documents based on provided project context.  There's no explicit frontend, although future iterations might include a web UI.

**1. Frontend Technologies:**

* **None (currently):** ADPA currently lacks a graphical user interface. Interaction is solely through the command-line interface (CLI).  Future development might incorporate a web UI built with a framework like React, Vue, or Angular, depending on project needs and resource availability.  The choice would depend on developer familiarity, community support, and performance requirements.

**2. Backend Technologies:**

* **Node.js (v18.0.0+):**  Chosen for its speed, scalability, large community support, and extensive ecosystem of packages for handling various tasks (e.g., file system interactions, API calls, asynchronous operations).  Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture is well-suited for handling concurrent requests efficiently.
* **TypeScript (latest version):** Used for developing the backend to enhance code maintainability, readability, and reduce runtime errors through static typing. This improves developer productivity and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
* **Express.js (latest version):**  A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for handling CLI interactions and (potentially future) API requests.  It's lightweight and provides a robust foundation for building scalable applications.

**3. Database Technologies:**

* **None (currently):** ADPA currently doesn't require a persistent database. All data processing is performed in-memory, and generated documents are written to the file system.  Future versions might incorporate a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing project configurations, user preferences, document history, or for more complex data management needs if the application's capabilities expand significantly. The choice would depend on data structure, scalability requirements, and developer familiarity.

**4. Infrastructure Components:**

* **Azure Cloud (recommended):**  Azure's services are heavily leveraged due to the integration with Azure OpenAI.  This provides seamless access to Azure OpenAI's powerful language models and simplifies authentication and authorization.  Other cloud providers (AWS, GCP) could be used, but would require adjustments to the authentication and API interaction components.
* **Azure OpenAI Service:**  The core AI engine powering ADPA's document generation capabilities.  This allows access to advanced LLMs like GPT-4, enabling sophisticated context understanding and document synthesis.  Alternatives like Google AI's Gemini, Ollama, or other LLM providers are also supported through configuration.  The selection depends on cost, performance requirements, and model availability.
* **Azure Entra ID (recommended):** For secure authentication and authorization when using Azure OpenAI.  This ensures secure access to the AI service and protects sensitive information.


**5. Development Tools:**

* **Visual Studio Code (or similar):** A popular code editor with strong TypeScript support, facilitating efficient code development and debugging.
* **npm/yarn:** Package managers for managing project dependencies.
* **Git:** For version control and collaboration.


**6. Testing Tools:**

* **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework, providing a comprehensive suite of testing capabilities for unit, integration, and potentially end-to-end tests.  This ensures code quality and reduces the risk of regressions.


**7. Monitoring Tools:**

* **None (currently):**  Currently, monitoring is limited to logging and CLI output.  For future scalability and production deployment, implementing monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) would be crucial to track application performance, resource usage, and potential errors.


**8. Deployment Tools:**

* **npm:**  For publishing the CLI package to npm.
* **Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions (recommended):** For automating CI/CD pipelines to ensure efficient and reliable deployment to the target environment (e.g., Azure cloud).


**9. Version Control and CI/CD:**

* **Git:**  Used for version control, enabling collaborative development and tracking code changes.
* **GitHub (or similar):**  For hosting the code repository and managing pull requests.
* **Azure DevOps/GitHub Actions (recommended):** For setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a streamlined and reliable release cycle.


**Justification of Technology Choices:**

The selected technologies are chosen to provide a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution.  TypeScript enhances code quality, Node.js offers speed and scalability, and Azure services integrate seamlessly with the AI engine.  The modular design allows for easier expansion and adaptation to future requirements.  The emphasis on testing and CI/CD ensures a high-quality and reliable product.

**Scalability:**

The architecture is designed to be scalable.  The use of Node.js with its non-blocking I/O model allows for efficient handling of concurrent requests.  The cloud-based infrastructure (Azure) offers inherent scalability, allowing for increased resources as needed.  The modular design facilitates scaling individual components independently.

**Maintainability:**

TypeScript, with its static typing and strong tooling support, significantly improves code maintainability.  The modular architecture simplifies code changes and reduces the risk of introducing bugs.  Comprehensive testing ensures that modifications don't negatively impact existing functionality.

**Version Information:**

All dependencies are managed through npm, ensuring version control and reproducibility.  The project uses semantic versioning for clear communication of changes.

**Dependencies:**

The project's dependencies are listed in the provided README.  They include packages for AI interaction, authentication, file system manipulation, and CLI management.  These dependencies are managed using npm, ensuring that the project remains consistent and reproducible across different environments.
