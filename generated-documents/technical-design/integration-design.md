## Integration Design Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Systems Integration Architect


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the integration design for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA), focusing on the interaction between its core API and external systems.  ADPA-RGA generates BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks and other project documentation based on input data.  This document details how the API integrates with various services and data sources, ensuring robust, secure, and scalable operation.


**2. Integration Overview**

ADPA-RGA employs a microservices-oriented architecture with an API-first approach.  The core functionality resides in the Express.js API, which interacts with several external systems:

* **AI Providers:**  The API interacts with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) for natural language processing and document generation.  This interaction is abstracted through a service layer for flexibility and maintainability.
* **Document Storage:** Generated documents can be stored in various locations, including local file systems, cloud storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage), or SharePoint Online.  The choice of storage is configurable.
* **Authentication & Authorization:**  The API utilizes API keys and potentially JWT for secure access control.  Integration with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is planned for enterprise deployments.
* **Monitoring & Logging:**  Integration with a centralized logging and monitoring system (e.g., ELK stack, Azure Monitor) is crucial for operational visibility and troubleshooting.

**3. Integration Patterns**

The following integration patterns are employed:

* **Message Transformation:**  The API transforms input data into a format suitable for the chosen AI provider and transforms the AI's output into the required document formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.).  This involves using appropriate mapping and transformation techniques.
* **Asynchronous Processing:**  Document generation is an inherently time-consuming task. Asynchronous processing with job queues (e.g., using Redis or a message broker like RabbitMQ) is employed to handle requests concurrently and prevent blocking the API.
* **Event-Driven Architecture (EDA):**  For future expansion, an EDA approach can be implemented to trigger downstream processes (e.g., notification of document completion) based on events generated by the API.
* **API Gateway:**  For large-scale deployments, an API gateway (e.g., Kong, Azure API Management) can be introduced to manage API traffic, enforce security policies, and provide additional functionalities like rate limiting and request transformation.


**4. System Interfaces**

* **Input Interface:**  The API accepts JSON payloads containing project information, stakeholder details, and other relevant data.  Zod schemas are used for robust input validation.
* **AI Provider Interface:**  A well-defined interface abstracts the interaction with different AI providers, enabling easy switching and addition of new providers.
* **Document Storage Interface:**  An abstract interface allows for flexible selection of document storage mechanisms without modifying core API logic.
* **Output Interface:**  The API returns JSON responses indicating job status, progress, and errors.  Generated documents are delivered via download links or stored in the configured location.


**5. Data Flow Design**

1. **Request Reception:** The API receives a request containing project details.
2. **Input Validation:** Zod schemas validate the input data.
3. **Job Creation:** An asynchronous job is created and added to the queue.
4. **AI Processing:** The job processor retrieves the job, interacts with the chosen AI provider, and generates the document.
5. **Document Storage:** The generated document is stored in the specified location.
6. **Response Generation:** The API sends a response to the client with the job ID and status.
7. **Status Updates:**  The API provides real-time status updates on the job progress.
8. **Document Retrieval:**  Clients can retrieve the generated document using the provided link or ID.


**6. Error Handling**

The API employs comprehensive error handling:

* **Input Validation Errors:**  Detailed error messages are returned for invalid input data.
* **AI Provider Errors:**  Errors from AI providers are handled gracefully and appropriate error messages are returned.
* **Storage Errors:**  Errors during document storage are logged and reported to the client.
* **System Errors:**  Unexpected system errors are logged and reported, along with relevant debugging information.

**7. Integration Points**

* **AI Provider Integration:**  The integration involves using the respective API clients for each provider (OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, etc.).  Rate limiting and retry mechanisms should be implemented.
* **Document Storage Integration:**  The integration depends on the chosen storage mechanism.  For cloud storage, appropriate SDKs are used.  For SharePoint, the Microsoft Graph API is utilized.
* **Authentication Integration:**  API keys are validated at the beginning of each request.  For Azure AD integration, OAuth 2.0 is used.
* **Logging & Monitoring Integration:**  The API uses a logging library (e.g., Winston) to log events and errors.  These logs are sent to a centralized monitoring system.


**8. Message Formats**

* **Input:** JSON using Zod schemas for validation.
* **Output:** JSON for API responses, and the chosen document format (PDF, DOCX, HTML, etc.) for generated documents.


**9. Integration Security**

* **API Key Authentication:**  API keys are used to secure access to the API.
* **Input Validation:**  Zod schemas prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Sanitization:**  Generated documents are sanitized to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **HTTPS:**  All communication is secured using HTTPS.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
* **Authorization (Future):**  Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented using Azure AD integration.


**10. Performance Considerations**

* **Asynchronous Processing:**  Using message queues significantly improves performance and scalability.
* **Caching:**  Caching frequently accessed data (e.g., templates) can reduce latency.
* **Database Optimization:**  Optimize database queries to minimize response times.
* **Load Balancing:**  For high traffic, load balancing across multiple API instances is necessary.


**11. Monitoring Strategy**

* **Logging:**  Detailed logging of all API requests, responses, and errors.
* **Metrics:**  Monitoring key metrics such as request latency, error rates, and throughput.
* **Alerts:**  Setting up alerts for critical errors and performance degradation.
* **Centralized Monitoring:**  Using a centralized monitoring system (e.g., Azure Monitor, Prometheus) for comprehensive visibility.


**12. Future Considerations**

* **Extensibility:**  Design the API to be easily extensible to support additional AI providers and document formats.
* **Scalability:**  Implement strategies to scale the API to handle increasing traffic and data volume.
* **Internationalization:**  Support for multiple languages.
