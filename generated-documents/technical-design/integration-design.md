## Integration Design Document: Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the integration design for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) system.  The RGA generates PMBOK-compliant project documentation using various AI providers. This design focuses on integrating the core RGA functionality with external systems like Azure AI services, SharePoint, and potentially other project management tools.  The design prioritizes scalability, security, and maintainability while adhering to enterprise integration patterns.

**2. Integration Overview**

The RGA employs a microservices architecture with a core service responsible for orchestrating the document generation process.  This core service interacts with several other components:

* **AI Provider Adapters:**  These adapters abstract the interaction with different AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), providing a consistent interface for the core service.
* **Document Template Service:** Manages and retrieves document templates.
* **Document Storage Service:** Stores generated documents, potentially integrating with SharePoint.
* **Authentication Service:** Handles secure authentication and authorization.
* **Logging & Monitoring Service:** Collects logs and metrics for system monitoring and debugging.

**3. Integration Patterns**

The following integration patterns will be utilized:

* **Message Queues (e.g., Azure Service Bus):**  Decouples the core service from AI providers and other services, improving scalability and resilience.  Requests for document generation are placed on a queue, and worker processes consume these requests and interact with the AI providers.  This allows for asynchronous processing and handling of potential provider failures.
* **API Gateway (e.g., Azure API Management):**  Provides a single entry point for all external interactions with the RGA, managing authentication, routing, and rate limiting.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:**  Events are published to notify other systems of completed document generation or errors.  This allows for real-time updates and integration with other workflows.
* **Repository Pattern:**  Abstraction of data access, allowing for easy swapping of different document storage solutions (e.g., file system, SharePoint).


**4. System Interfaces**

* **Core Service Interface:** RESTful API for external systems to initiate document generation.  This API will include endpoints for submitting requests, retrieving status, and accessing generated documents.
* **AI Provider Adapter Interfaces:**  Each adapter will expose a consistent interface for document generation, irrespective of the underlying AI provider's API.
* **Document Template Service Interface:**  RESTful API for managing and retrieving document templates.
* **Document Storage Service Interface:**  Abstracted interface for storing and retrieving documents.  This interface will support different storage mechanisms (e.g., local file system, SharePoint).
* **Authentication Service Interface:**  Provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, potentially using OAuth 2.0 for external systems like SharePoint.

**5. Data Flow Design**

1. A client application submits a document generation request via the API Gateway to the Core Service.
2. The Core Service places the request on a message queue.
3. A worker process consumes the request from the queue.
4. The worker process interacts with the appropriate AI Provider Adapter to generate the document.
5. The generated document is stored in the Document Storage Service.
6. An event is published to notify other systems (e.g., SharePoint integration) of the document's availability.
7. The client application can retrieve the document via the Core Service API.


**6. Error Handling**

* **Retry Mechanisms:**  Implement retry logic for transient failures when interacting with AI providers or storage services.
* **Circuit Breakers:**  Prevent cascading failures by stopping requests to failing services temporarily.
* **Dead-Letter Queues:**  Handle messages that cannot be processed successfully.
* **Comprehensive Logging:**  Log all errors and exceptions for debugging and analysis.
* **Error Codes & Messages:**  Return informative error codes and messages to client applications.


**7. Integration Points**

* **Azure AI Services:**  Integration with OpenAI and Google AI APIs via dedicated adapters.
* **SharePoint:**  Integration using the Microsoft Graph API for document publishing and metadata management.  This will involve OAuth 2.0 authentication and handling of SharePoint-specific error conditions.
* **Other Project Management Tools (Future):**  The design should accommodate future integration with other project management tools via a plugin architecture.


**8. Message Formats**

* **Request/Response Messages:**  JSON will be used for all request and response messages.  Schemas will be defined using JSON Schema for validation.
* **Event Messages:**  JSON will also be used for event messages, with specific schemas defined for each event type.


**9. Integration Security**

* **API Keys/JWT:**  Secure API keys or JWTs will be used for authentication and authorization.
* **HTTPS:**  All communication between services will be secured using HTTPS.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate all input data to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Sanitization:**  Sanitize all output data to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Azure Active Directory Integration:**  Leverage Azure AD for secure authentication and authorization with SharePoint and other Azure services.


**10. Performance Considerations**

* **Asynchronous Processing:**  Utilize message queues for asynchronous processing to improve scalability and responsiveness.
* **Caching:**  Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data (e.g., document templates).
* **Load Balancing:**  Distribute load across multiple worker processes to handle high request volumes.
* **Database Optimization:**  Optimize database queries and schema for efficient data access.


**11. Monitoring Strategy**

* **Application Insights (Azure):**  Monitor application performance, exceptions, and logs.
* **Service Bus Metrics:**  Monitor message queue performance.
* **Custom Metrics:**  Collect custom metrics related to document generation time, error rates, and provider availability.
* **Alerting:**  Configure alerts for critical errors and performance issues.


**12. Dependencies**

* Azure Service Bus
* Azure API Management
* Azure Active Directory
* Microsoft Graph API
* Node.js (with relevant libraries)
* Specific AI Provider SDKs (OpenAI, Google Cloud, etc.)
