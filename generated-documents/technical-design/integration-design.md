## Integration Design Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (Systems Integration Architect)


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the integration design for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA), a system that automates the generation of BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  The system utilizes an API-first approach, employing several enterprise integration patterns to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability.  The primary focus is on the integration between the core ADPA-RGA API, external AI services (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), and potential downstream systems like SharePoint for document storage and distribution.

**2. Integration Overview**

ADPA-RGA leverages a microservices-based architecture.  The core functionality resides in an Express.js API, responsible for receiving requests, processing data, invoking AI services, and generating output documents.  Integration with external systems occurs through well-defined interfaces and messaging patterns.

**3. Integration Patterns**

The following integration patterns are employed:

* **API Gateway:** The Express.js API acts as an API Gateway, abstracting the underlying complexity of AI service interactions and document generation.  It handles authentication, authorization, request routing, and response transformation.
* **Message Transformation:**  Data transformation is crucial.  The API translates incoming requests (likely JSON payloads containing project details) into formats suitable for the chosen AI service and transforms the AI responses back into structured documents (e.g., Markdown, JSON, then converted to PDF/DOCX).  This involves using appropriate libraries for data mapping and validation (e.g., Zod, mapStruct).
* **Asynchronous Processing:**  Document generation is computationally intensive.  The system utilizes asynchronous processing (likely using message queues like RabbitMQ or Kafka) to decouple the request processing from the lengthy AI calls and document generation.  This improves responsiveness and scalability.  Job status updates are provided via polling or websockets.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:**  Events are used to signal the completion of document generation jobs, allowing downstream systems (like SharePoint) to be notified and initiate document publishing.
* **Orchestration:** A workflow engine (possibly built-in or a separate service) could orchestrate the entire process, managing the interaction with different AI providers, handling potential failures, and ensuring compliance with BABOK v3.


**4. System Interfaces**

* **ADPA-RGA API (RESTful):**  Exposes endpoints for document generation requests, job status retrieval, and template management.  Uses OpenAPI 3.0 specification for clear interface definition.
* **AI Service Interfaces:**  Direct API calls to OpenAI, Google AI, etc.  These interfaces are abstracted within the ADPA-RGA API to allow for easy switching of providers.
* **SharePoint Interface (Microsoft Graph API):**  Used for uploading generated documents to SharePoint document libraries.  Uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
* **CLI Interface:**  Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.


**5. Data Flow Design**

1. **Request:** A client sends a request (e.g., JSON payload) to the ADPA-RGA API's `/api/v1/documents/convert` endpoint.
2. **Validation:** The API validates the request using Zod schemas.
3. **Asynchronous Processing:** The request is placed in a message queue.
4. **AI Service Invocation:** A worker process consumes the message, selects an appropriate AI service, and sends the transformed data.
5. **Document Generation:** The AI service generates the document content.
6. **Transformation and Validation:** The response is transformed, validated against BABOK v3 standards, and converted to the desired format.
7. **Storage:** The generated document is stored temporarily (e.g., in cloud storage).
8. **SharePoint Upload (optional):** If configured, the document is uploaded to SharePoint via the Microsoft Graph API.
9. **Response:** The API updates the job status and returns a response to the client.
10. **Event Notification:** An event is published upon successful document generation, triggering SharePoint upload (if enabled).


**6. Error Handling**

The system implements comprehensive error handling at multiple levels:

* **Input Validation:** Zod schemas ensure data integrity before processing.
* **AI Service Errors:**  Robust error handling for AI service failures (timeouts, rate limits, API errors).
* **Document Generation Errors:**  Error handling during document transformation and conversion.
* **SharePoint Errors:**  Error handling during SharePoint uploads (authentication failures, permission issues, etc.).
* **Centralized Logging:**  Detailed logging using Winston or similar to track errors and system behavior.


**7. Integration Points**

* **AI Service Integration:**  Abstracted via interfaces to facilitate easy switching of providers.
* **SharePoint Integration:**  Pluggable module allowing for optional SharePoint document publishing.
* **Database Integration (optional):**  Could be added for persistence of templates, jobs, and other metadata.


**8. Message Formats**

* **Request:** JSON payload following a predefined schema.
* **Response:** JSON payload containing job status and relevant metadata.
* **Internal Messaging:** JSON messages exchanged between the API and worker processes via the message queue.


**9. Integration Security**

* **API Key Authentication:**  Uses API keys for secure access to the ADPA-RGA API.
* **OAuth 2.0 (SharePoint):**  Secure authentication with SharePoint using Azure AD.
* **HTTPS:**  All communication uses HTTPS for encryption.
* **Input Sanitization:**  Input sanitization to prevent injection attacks.


**10. Performance Considerations**

* **Asynchronous Processing:**  Decouples request processing from lengthy operations.
* **Caching:**  Caching of frequently accessed templates and data.
* **Load Balancing:**  Load balancing across multiple API instances to handle high traffic.
* **AI Service Optimization:**  Careful selection of AI models and parameters to optimize performance.


**11. Monitoring Strategy**

* **Application Monitoring:**  Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor API performance, resource utilization, and error rates.
* **Log Monitoring:**  Centralized logging and log aggregation to track errors and system behavior.
* **AI Service Monitoring:**  Monitoring of AI service usage and performance.
* **Alerting:**  Setup alerts for critical errors and performance degradation.


**12. Future Considerations**

* **Integration with other PM tools:**  Extend integration to other project management tools (Jira, Asana, etc.).
* **Support for additional BABOK practices:**  Expand support to other BABOK v3 practices.
* **Improved AI provider selection and management:**  Develop a more sophisticated mechanism for selecting and managing AI providers.
