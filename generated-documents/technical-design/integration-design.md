# Integration Design Document: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the design for integrating and automating the backup process for Project Backup Vermigerous. The goal is to improve reliability, security, and efficiency of the backup and restore process.  The design focuses on leveraging incremental backups, secure storage, robust validation, and automated monitoring and alerting.

**2. Integration Overview**

Project Backup Vermigerous currently performs monthly backups. This design proposes a complete overhaul to introduce automation, improved storage, data integrity checks, and recovery testing.  The system will utilize an Enterprise Integration Pattern (EIP) approach, primarily employing the **Message Broker** pattern to decouple the backup process from other system components.  A central message broker (e.g., Azure Service Bus) will handle scheduling, triggering backups, validating results, and sending alerts.

**3. Integration Patterns**

* **Message Broker:**  A central message queue (Azure Service Bus) will handle asynchronous communication between the backup scheduler, the backup process, the validation component, and the monitoring system. This allows for loose coupling and improved scalability.
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Backups will be triggered by scheduled events (cron jobs or Azure Automation).  Events will also be generated for backup completion, validation success/failure, and recovery test results.
* **Orchestration:** Azure Logic Apps or a custom orchestrator could be used to manage the sequence of backup, validation, and storage operations.

**4. System Interfaces**

The system will consist of the following interacting components:

* **Backup Scheduler:** This component (cron job, Azure Automation, or PowerShell script) initiates the backup process at scheduled intervals.  It sends a message to the message broker to trigger a backup.
* **Backup Process:** This component performs the actual backup operation. It can be a custom script or a third-party backup utility.  It sends a message to the message broker upon completion, including success/failure status and metadata.
* **Validation Component:** This component verifies the integrity of the backup using checksums (SHA-256). It sends a message to the message broker indicating validation success or failure.
* **Storage Component:** This component handles secure storage of backups in Azure Blob Storage with a Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy for immutability.  It receives messages from the message broker to upload backups.
* **Metadata Manager:** This component (database or JSON file) stores metadata about each backup (project name, date, version, checksum). It interacts with the message broker to receive and store metadata.
* **Monitoring & Alerting System:** This component (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics) receives messages from the message broker to track backup status and send alerts for failures or anomalies.  It can also trigger automated recovery tests.
* **Recovery Test Component:** This component performs automated restores in a sandbox environment at scheduled intervals. It sends messages to the message broker with test results.


**5. Data Flow Design**

1. The Backup Scheduler sends a message to the message broker to initiate a backup.
2. The message broker routes the message to the Backup Process.
3. The Backup Process performs the backup and sends a completion message (including metadata and success/failure status) to the message broker.
4. The message broker routes the completion message to the Validation Component and the Storage Component.
5. The Validation Component performs checksum validation and sends a validation result message to the message broker.
6. The Storage Component uploads the backup to Azure Blob Storage and sends a storage completion message to the message broker.
7. The message broker routes all messages to the Monitoring & Alerting System and the Metadata Manager.
8. The Monitoring & Alerting System tracks the status and sends alerts as needed.
9. The Metadata Manager stores the backup metadata.
10. The Recovery Test Component (scheduled independently) performs restores and reports results via the message broker.


**6. Error Handling**

* **Retry Mechanisms:** Implement retries for failed backup, validation, and storage operations with exponential backoff.
* **Dead-Letter Queues:** Use dead-letter queues in the message broker to handle messages that cannot be processed.
* **Alerting:** Send alerts for critical errors (e.g., backup failure, validation failure, storage failure).
* **Logging:** Detailed logging of all operations, including errors and exceptions.


**7. Integration Points**

* The Backup Scheduler integrates with the system's scheduling mechanism (cron, Azure Automation).
* The Backup Process integrates with the system's backup utility.
* The Storage Component integrates with Azure Blob Storage.
* The Monitoring & Alerting System integrates with Azure Monitor or similar tools.


**8. Message Formats**

Messages exchanged between components will be in JSON format, with clearly defined schemas for each message type.


**9. Integration Security**

* **Encryption:** Backups will be encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 encryption.
* **Authentication:** Secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., managed identities) will be used for all component interactions.
* **Access Control:**  Restrict access to storage accounts and other resources using role-based access control (RBAC).


**10. Performance Considerations**

* **Incremental Backups:** Use incremental or differential backups to minimize backup time and storage space.
* **Parallel Processing:** Parallelize backup and validation operations where possible.
* **Optimized Storage:** Use appropriate Azure Blob Storage tiers for cost optimization.


**11. Monitoring Strategy**

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor backup progress, validation status, and storage utilization in real time.
* **Alerting:** Set up alerts for critical errors, delays, and storage thresholds.
* **Reporting:** Generate regular reports on backup success rates, storage usage, and recovery test results.


**12. Dependencies**

* Azure Subscription
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Service Bus (or similar message broker)
* Azure Automation (or cron jobs, PowerShell)
* Backup utility (if not custom-built)
* Monitoring and alerting system (Azure Monitor, etc.)


This document provides a high-level design.  Further detailed design specifications will be developed during the subsequent phases of the project.
