## Deployment Architecture Document: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Deployment Overview**

ADPA employs a microservices architecture, deploying independent components to maximize scalability, resilience, and maintainability.  The core components are:

* **AI Processing Engine:**  Handles interactions with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama). Deployed as a separate microservice for independent scaling.
* **Document Generator:**  Generates documents based on templates and AI-provided content.  Deployed as a microservice.
* **REST API Server:**  Provides a production-ready REST API for external access and integration. Deployed as a microservice using Express.js.
* **CLI Interface:** A command-line interface for local interactions.  Packaged as a standalone executable.
* **Admin Interface:** A Next.js web application for managing ADPA. Deployed separately.
* **Integration Layer:**  Handles connections to external systems (Confluence, SharePoint, Adobe Document Services, VCS).  Implemented as separate modules within the API server and CLI.
* **Analytics & Reporting:**  Collects usage metrics and generates reports.  Integrated into the API server.


**2. Infrastructure Architecture**

The target infrastructure is cloud-based, leveraging a platform like AWS, Azure, or GCP.  A containerization strategy (Docker) is recommended for all microservices, orchestrated using Kubernetes for automated deployment, scaling, and management.


**2.1. Component Deployment:**

* **Microservices:** Each microservice will be containerized using Docker and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster.  This allows for independent scaling and high availability.
* **Database:** A scalable database solution (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) will be used, potentially deployed as a managed service.  Data persistence is primarily JSON-based configuration files, but integration with SQL/NoSQL databases is planned for future releases.
* **Caching:** Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
* **Load Balancing:** A load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple instances of each microservice.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:**  A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI) will automate the build, testing, and deployment process.

**2.2. Network Architecture:**

A private virtual network (VPN) will be used to secure communication between microservices and external systems.  Access control lists (ACLs) will be implemented to restrict access to specific resources.


**3. Environment Setup**

Three environments are recommended:

* **Development:** Used for code development and testing.
* **Staging:** Used for pre-production testing and validation.
* **Production:** Used for live operation.

Each environment will have its own Kubernetes cluster and database instance.  Configuration will be managed using environment variables and configuration files.


**4. Deployment Process**

The deployment process will follow a CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Code Commit:** Developers commit code changes to the Git repository.
2. **Build:** The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds the Docker images for each microservice.
3. **Test:** Automated tests are run to ensure code quality and functionality.
4. **Deploy:**  The Docker images are deployed to the target environment (Dev, Staging, Prod) using Kubernetes.  Deployment strategies like rolling updates or blue/green deployments will be used to minimize downtime.
5. **Verification:**  Post-deployment checks verify the successful deployment and functionality.


**5. Configuration Management**

Configuration will be managed using environment variables and configuration files stored in a configuration management system (e.g., Git, HashiCorp Consul).  This allows for easy management of configurations across different environments.  A `.env` file approach is already in place, which needs to be expanded for production environments.


**6. Scaling Strategy**

ADPA will utilize Kubernetes' horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA) to automatically scale the number of microservice instances based on demand.  This ensures optimal resource utilization and performance.


**7. Monitoring Setup**

Comprehensive monitoring will be implemented using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.  Metrics will be collected from all microservices and infrastructure components.  Logging will be centralized using a logging system like Elasticsearch and Kibana.  Alerts will be configured to notify administrators of potential issues.


**8. Backup and Recovery**

Regular backups of the database and configuration files will be performed.  A recovery plan will be defined to restore the system in case of failure.  The frequency of backups will depend on the data criticality and RTO/RPO requirements.


**9. Disaster Recovery**

A disaster recovery plan will be developed to ensure business continuity in case of a major outage.  This plan will include procedures for restoring the system from backups and failover to a secondary infrastructure.  A geographically redundant setup is highly recommended.


**10. Maintenance Procedures**

Regular maintenance tasks, including software updates, security patching, and performance tuning, will be performed.  A maintenance schedule will be established to minimize disruption to service.


**Dependencies:**

* Kubernetes
* Docker
* CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, GitLab CI)
* Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana)
* Logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Kibana)
* Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
* Caching (e.g., Redis)
* Load balancer


This deployment architecture is designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability.  The specific technologies and configurations will be further refined based on the chosen cloud provider and specific requirements.  Security best practices will be integrated throughout the entire deployment process.
