## Deployment Architecture Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Deployment Overview:**

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a Node.js based API deployed as a microservice.  This document outlines the deployment architecture, focusing on a production environment.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, reliability, and security.  We will utilize a containerized approach with Kubernetes for orchestration and management.

**2. Infrastructure Architecture:**

The system will be deployed on a cloud provider (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP).  The choice of provider will depend on existing organizational infrastructure and cost considerations. The architecture consists of the following components:

* **Kubernetes Cluster:**  A managed Kubernetes service will be used to orchestrate the deployment and scaling of the application. This provides high availability, self-healing capabilities, and automated rollouts.
* **Container Registry:** A private container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry) will store the Docker images of the application. This ensures secure and efficient image distribution.
* **Load Balancer:** A load balancer will distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of the application, ensuring high availability and preventing single points of failure.
* **Database:** A managed database service (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB, Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL) will store persistent data. The choice of database will depend on the specific requirements of the application.  Consideration should be given to scalability and performance.
* **API Gateway:** An API gateway (e.g., Azure API Management, Amazon API Gateway, Google Cloud API Gateway) will act as a single entry point for all API requests, providing security, rate limiting, and other essential features.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** A centralized monitoring and logging system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack) will collect metrics and logs from all components of the system, providing insights into the performance and health of the application.

**3. Environment Setup:**

* **Development:** Local development environments using Docker Compose for local testing and development.
* **Staging:** A staging environment mirroring the production environment for testing and validation before deployment.
* **Production:** The final production environment hosted on the chosen cloud provider.

**4. Deployment Process:**

The deployment process will be automated using CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).  The steps involved are:

1. **Code Commit:** Developers commit code changes to the main Git repository.
2. **Build:** The CI pipeline builds the Docker image and pushes it to the container registry.  This includes running unit and integration tests.
3. **Deploy:** The CD pipeline deploys the new image to the Kubernetes cluster using rolling updates or blue/green deployments to minimize downtime.
4. **Testing:** Automated tests are run in the staging environment to verify the functionality of the new deployment.
5. **Production Deployment:** Upon successful staging tests, the new image is deployed to the production environment.

**5. Configuration Management:**

Configuration will be managed using environment variables and configuration files stored in a secure location (e.g., Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Google Cloud Secret Manager).  This approach ensures that sensitive information is not hardcoded into the application.

**6. Scaling Strategy:**

The application will be scaled horizontally by adding more pods to the Kubernetes cluster.  The Kubernetes autoscaler will automatically adjust the number of pods based on the current load.

**7. Monitoring Setup:**

The monitoring system will collect metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, request latency, and error rates.  Alerts will be configured to notify the operations team of any issues.  Logs will be centralized and analyzed to identify and resolve problems.

**8. Backup and Recovery:**

Regular backups of the database will be performed.  The Kubernetes cluster will provide automatic backups of the application state.  A disaster recovery plan will be in place to ensure business continuity in case of a major outage.

**9. Disaster Recovery:**

A geographically redundant Kubernetes cluster will be used to ensure high availability and disaster recovery.  The database will also be replicated across multiple regions.

**10. Maintenance Procedures:**

Regular maintenance tasks will be performed, including patching the application, upgrading dependencies, and performing security audits.  These tasks will be automated as much as possible.


**Dependencies:**

* Node.js & npm (or yarn)
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Cloud Provider (Azure, AWS, or GCP)
* CI/CD Pipeline (Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.)
* Monitoring and Logging tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, etc.)
* Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
* API Gateway (optional but recommended)


This document provides a high-level overview of the deployment architecture.  More detailed documentation will be provided for specific components and processes.  The specific technologies and configurations will be chosen based on the project requirements and budget.
