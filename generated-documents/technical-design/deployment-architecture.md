## Deployment Architecture Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Deployment Overview**

This document outlines the deployment architecture for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA), a production-ready Express.js API designed to generate BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  The architecture prioritizes scalability, reliability, and security.  The deployment strategy leverages a containerized approach using Docker and Kubernetes for orchestration, enabling easy deployment across various environments (development, staging, production).

**2. Infrastructure Architecture**

The ADPA-RGA deployment utilizes a three-tier architecture:

* **Presentation Tier:**  This tier exposes the API endpoints via a load balancer.  It consists of multiple instances of the ADPA-RGA application container running in a Kubernetes cluster.
* **Application Tier:** This tier contains the core application logic, including the Express.js API, database interactions, and AI service integrations (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).  This tier is also containerized and orchestrated by Kubernetes.
* **Data Tier:**  This tier stores application data, potentially including user settings, generated documents, and logs.  Options include a managed cloud database service (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB, AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud SQL) or a self-hosted database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).  Consider persistent storage solutions for data persistence across container restarts.

+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
| Load Balancer   | <--> | Kubernetes Cluster| <--> | Data Tier       |

                      ^                               |
                      |                               |

                      v                               v
                  +-----------------+             +-----------------+
                  |  Application Logic|             | Persistent Storage |
                  +-----------------+             +-----------------+
```

**3. Environment Setup**

* **Development:** Local development environment using Docker Compose for easy setup and testing.
* **Staging:** Kubernetes cluster in a cloud provider (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)) for pre-production testing.
* **Production:**  A highly available and scalable Kubernetes cluster in a cloud provider, potentially utilizing multiple availability zones for redundancy.

**4. Deployment Process**

1. **Containerization:** The ADPA-RGA application is packaged into a Docker container, ensuring consistent execution across environments.  A Dockerfile will be provided detailing the build process.
2. **Image Building and Pushing:** The Docker image is built and pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, Google Container Registry, Amazon Elastic Container Registry).
3. **Kubernetes Deployment:** Kubernetes deployments manage the lifecycle of the application containers.  Deployments will define the number of replicas, resource limits, and other configuration parameters.
4. **Service Discovery:** A Kubernetes service exposes the application to the load balancer.
5. **Load Balancing:** A load balancer distributes incoming requests across multiple application instances, ensuring high availability and scalability.
6. **Monitoring and Logging:**  Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and logging solutions (e.g., Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana (EFK stack), Azure Monitor) for real-time insights into application health and performance.

**5. Configuration Management**

Configuration values (API keys, database credentials, etc.) will be managed using Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets.  This ensures that sensitive information is not hardcoded into the application.

**6. Scaling Strategy**

Horizontal scaling will be employed to handle increased load.  Kubernetes will automatically create new application instances based on the defined scaling policies (e.g., based on CPU utilization or request rate).

**7. Monitoring Setup**

Comprehensive monitoring will be implemented using a combination of:

* **Application Metrics:** Track key metrics such as request latency, error rate, and throughput.
* **System Metrics:** Monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk I/O.
* **Log Aggregation:** Centralized logging for troubleshooting and analysis.
* **Alerting:**  Set up alerts based on critical thresholds to proactively address potential issues.

**8. Backup and Recovery**

* **Database Backups:** Regular backups of the database will be performed using the database provider's built-in tools or third-party solutions.
* **Container Image Backups:**  Regularly back up the Docker images stored in the container registry.
* **Kubernetes State Backups:**  Consider backing up the Kubernetes cluster state for disaster recovery purposes.

**9. Disaster Recovery**

A disaster recovery plan will be defined, including procedures for restoring the application and data in case of a major outage.  This plan will outline failover mechanisms and recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).  Consider using a geographically redundant Kubernetes cluster for high availability.

**10. Maintenance Procedures**

Regular maintenance procedures will be established, including:

* **Software Updates:**  Regularly update the application and its dependencies.
* **Security Patches:** Apply security patches promptly to address vulnerabilities.
* **Performance Tuning:**  Periodically review and optimize application performance.
* **Log Rotation:** Implement log rotation to manage disk space usage.

**Dependencies:**  Docker, Kubernetes, Cloud Provider (Azure, AWS, GCP), Container Registry, Database, Monitoring and Logging Tools.

This architecture provides a robust and scalable foundation for the ADPA-RGA deployment.  Specific implementation details will be further elaborated in subsequent documentation.
