## Deployment Architecture Document: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** DevOps Architect


**1. Deployment Overview**

The Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) will be deployed as a serverless application leveraging Azure's cloud infrastructure. This approach minimizes operational overhead, scales automatically based on demand, and enhances security.  The core application logic resides in a containerized environment (Docker), orchestrated by Azure Container Instances (ACI) or Kubernetes (AKS) depending on future scaling needs.  The CLI tool is distributed via npm, allowing users to install and run it locally.  Generated documents are stored in a designated Azure Blob Storage container.

**2. Infrastructure Architecture**

The infrastructure consists of the following components:

* **Azure Subscription:**  The central platform hosting all resources.
* **Azure Container Instances (ACI) / Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):**  Container orchestration for the ADPA application. ACI will be used initially for simplicity and cost-effectiveness, with a potential migration to AKS for increased scalability and advanced orchestration features as user base grows.
* **Azure Blob Storage:**  Secure storage for generated documents.  Access control lists (ACLs) will be implemented to restrict access based on user roles.
* **Azure OpenAI Service:**  The primary AI provider for document generation.  Secured using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication and authorization.  Alternative AI providers (Google AI, Ollama, GitHub AI) are supported through configuration and abstracted behind a common interface.
* **Azure Key Vault:** Secure storage for API keys, connection strings, and other sensitive information.
* **Azure Monitor:**  For application performance monitoring, logging, and alerting.
* **Azure DevOps:**  For CI/CD pipeline automation.

**3. Environment Setup**

* **Development:**  Developers will use local Docker containers and emulate Azure services locally using mocking frameworks.
* **Staging:** A replica of the production environment used for testing and validation before deployment.
* **Production:** The live environment accessible to users.  This will be hosted in a dedicated Azure region selected based on user location and latency requirements.

**4. Deployment Process**

A CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps will automate the deployment process:

1. **Code Commit:** Developers commit code changes to the main branch.
2. **Build:** Azure DevOps builds the Docker image.
3. **Test:** Automated tests run to validate functionality and performance.
4. **Deploy to Staging:** The built image is deployed to the staging environment.
5. **Manual Testing:** Thorough testing is performed in the staging environment.
6. **Deploy to Production:**  Upon successful staging testing, the image is deployed to the production environment.  This might involve blue-green deployment or canary deployments for minimal disruption.
7. **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of the production environment using Azure Monitor.

**5. Configuration Management**

Configuration will be managed using environment variables stored in Azure Key Vault. This ensures secure storage and easy management of sensitive information across environments.  A configuration file (`config-rga.json`) will allow for customization of non-sensitive settings.

**6. Scaling Strategy**

The serverless nature of the application allows for automatic scaling. ACI or AKS will automatically scale up or down based on the number of concurrent requests.  Metrics from Azure Monitor will trigger scaling events.

**7. Monitoring Setup**

Azure Monitor will be used to monitor application performance, resource utilization, and error rates.  Custom dashboards and alerts will be configured to proactively identify and address potential issues.  Logs will be streamed to Azure Log Analytics for analysis and troubleshooting.

**8. Backup and Recovery**

Azure Blob Storage offers built-in replication and redundancy for data durability.  Regular backups of the application configuration and other critical data will be implemented.

**9. Disaster Recovery**

Azure's geo-redundancy features will ensure high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.  The application will be deployed across multiple availability zones within a region. A secondary region can be configured for failover in case of a major outage.

**10. Maintenance Procedures**

Regular maintenance will include:

* **Software Updates:**  Automatic updates of the application and its dependencies.
* **Security Patches:**  Regular application of security patches.
* **Performance Tuning:**  Regular optimization of application performance.
* **Log Analysis:**  Regular review of application logs for potential issues.


**11. Security Considerations**

* **Azure AD Authentication:**  All access to Azure services will be secured using Azure AD.
* **Network Security Groups (NSGs):**  Restrict network access to only necessary ports and IP addresses.
* **Private Endpoints:**  Use private endpoints to access Azure services from within the virtual network.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools.
* **Secrets Management:**  Store sensitive information in Azure Key Vault.
* **Input Validation:**  Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Sanitization:** Sanitize all outputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
