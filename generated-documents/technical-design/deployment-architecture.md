# Deployment Architecture Document: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** DevOps Architect


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the deployment architecture for the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) application.  ADPA is a complex application requiring a robust and scalable deployment strategy to handle its diverse functionality, including AI model integration, document generation, and potential future integrations (SharePoint, Confluence).  This architecture prioritizes reliability, scalability, maintainability, and security.

## 2. Deployment Overview

ADPA will be deployed as a microservices architecture, leveraging containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes). This approach allows for independent scaling of individual components and simplifies deployment, updates, and maintenance.  The system will be deployed to a cloud environment (Azure is preferred, but AWS or GCP could be substituted with minimal architectural changes).

**Key Deployment Characteristics:**

* **Microservices:** Decoupled services for improved scalability and maintainability.
* **Containerization (Docker):** Ensures consistent execution across environments.
* **Orchestration (Kubernetes):** Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
* **Cloud Native:** Leverages cloud-native services for scalability and resilience.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated build, test, and deployment pipeline for continuous delivery.


## 3. Infrastructure Architecture

The infrastructure will comprise the following components:

* **Kubernetes Cluster:**  A managed Kubernetes service (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)) will host the ADPA microservices. This provides automatic scaling, high availability, and self-healing capabilities.
* **Container Registry:** A private container registry (e.g., Azure Container Registry (ACR)) will store the Docker images for each microservice.
* **Load Balancer:** A cloud load balancer (e.g., Azure Load Balancer) will distribute traffic across multiple instances of the microservices for high availability and scalability.
* **Database:** A managed database service (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL) will store application configuration and potentially user data (depending on future feature additions).
* **AI Model Access:** Secure access to the chosen AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) will be managed through service principals and managed identities.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**  Centralized monitoring and logging using a solution like Azure Monitor will provide insights into application performance and health.
* **Networking:** Virtual networks and subnets will be used to isolate the ADPA environment and control access.


## 4. Environment Setup

Three environments will be used:

* **Development:** Used by developers for code development, testing, and debugging.
* **Staging:** A replica of the production environment used for testing before deployment.
* **Production:** The live environment accessible to users.


## 5. Deployment Process

The deployment process will be fully automated using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).  The pipeline will perform the following steps:

1. **Build:** Docker images for each microservice will be built automatically upon code commits.
2. **Test:** Automated unit and integration tests will be executed.
3. **Deploy:**  The new Docker images will be pushed to the container registry and deployed to the target environment (Dev, Staging, or Production) using Kubernetes.  Kubernetes will handle rolling updates to minimize downtime.
4. **Validation:** Post-deployment checks will verify the application's functionality and health.


## 6. Configuration Management

Configuration will be managed using a centralized configuration store (e.g., Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets). This approach ensures secure storage of sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) and allows for easy modification of configuration parameters without redeploying the application.


## 7. Scaling Strategy

ADPA will be scaled horizontally by increasing the number of instances of each microservice running in the Kubernetes cluster.  The Kubernetes autoscaler will automatically adjust the number of instances based on resource utilization and demand.


## 8. Monitoring Setup

Comprehensive monitoring will be implemented to track application performance, resource utilization, and error rates.  Key metrics will include:

* **Request latency:** Time taken to process requests.
* **Error rates:** Number of failed requests.
* **Resource utilization:** CPU, memory, and network usage.
* **AI provider response times:** Latency of AI model calls.
* **Document generation times:** Time taken to generate documents.

Alerts will be configured to notify the operations team of critical issues.


## 9. Backup and Recovery

Regular backups of the database will be performed automatically.  A disaster recovery plan will be in place to ensure business continuity in case of major outages.


## 10. Disaster Recovery

A disaster recovery plan will be defined, including:

* **Geo-redundancy:** Deploying the Kubernetes cluster in multiple regions for high availability.
* **Backup and restore procedures:**  Detailed procedures for restoring the application from backups.
* **Failover mechanisms:**  Automatic failover to a secondary region in case of an outage.


## 11. Maintenance Procedures

Regular maintenance activities will include:

* **Software updates:**  Applying security patches and updates to the application and its dependencies.
* **Performance tuning:** Optimizing application performance and resource utilization.
* **Capacity planning:**  Ensuring sufficient resources are available to handle anticipated demand.


## 12. Security Considerations

Security is paramount.  The following measures will be implemented:

* **Secure container images:**  Building secure Docker images with minimal dependencies.
* **Network security:**  Using virtual networks, subnets, and network security groups to control access to the ADPA environment.
* **Identity and access management:**  Using Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization.
* **Secret management:**  Storing sensitive information in a secure configuration store (Azure Key Vault).
* **Regular security audits:**  Conducting regular security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.


## 13. Technology Stack Summary

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (AKS preferred)
* **Cloud Provider:** Azure (AWS or GCP adaptable)
* **Database:** Azure Cosmos DB or PostgreSQL
* **CI/CD:** Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions
* **Monitoring:** Azure Monitor
* **Secret Management:** Azure Key Vault


This deployment architecture provides a robust and scalable foundation for ADPA.  Further details will be elaborated in subsequent design documents as the project progresses.
