## Deployment Architecture Document: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Deployment Overview:**

Project Backup Vermigerous automates monthly backups and validates the integrity of project data for recovery after system failures.  This document outlines the deployment architecture designed to improve automation, security, and recovery capabilities. The architecture leverages Azure services for scalability, security, and reliability.

**2. Infrastructure Architecture:**

The architecture consists of the following components:

* **Backup Source:** The application servers and databases containing the project data to be backed up.
* **Backup Agent:** A service (Azure Automation account running a PowerShell script or a scheduled cron job) responsible for initiating and managing backups.  This agent will utilize incremental or differential backup strategies.
* **Backup Storage:** Azure Blob Storage with Write Once Read Many (WORM) enabled for immutability and enhanced security.  Backups are encrypted at rest and in transit using AES-256 and TLS.
* **Metadata Storage:** A Cosmos DB instance to store metadata associated with each backup (project name, year, month, version, checksum). This allows for efficient searching and retrieval.
* **Monitoring & Alerting:** Azure Monitor integrates with the backup agent and storage to track backup status, alert on failures, and provide performance metrics.  Alerts are configured to notify relevant personnel via email or SMS.
* **Recovery Environment:** A separate Azure environment (potentially a different region for disaster recovery) where backups can be restored for testing and recovery.
* **Backup Validation:** A scheduled task within the Azure Automation account that verifies backup integrity using checksum comparison.  This involves generating SHA-256 hashes before and after backup and comparing them.


**3. Environment Setup:**

* **Development Environment:** Used for testing and development of the backup scripts and processes.
* **Staging Environment:**  A replica of the production environment for testing the backup process before deployment to production.
* **Production Environment:**  The live environment where the backup process runs on a regular schedule.

**4. Deployment Process:**

1. **Development:**  The backup agent script is developed and tested in the development environment.  Unit tests verify individual components, and integration tests validate the end-to-end backup process.
2. **Staging:** The script is deployed to the staging environment.  Thorough testing is performed to simulate a production environment and verify backup integrity.
3. **Production:**  Once the script performs successfully in staging, it's deployed to the production environment.  Deployment is automated using Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline.  Post-deployment checks verify the script is running and backups are being created successfully.

**5. Configuration Management:**

All configurations (Azure subscriptions, storage account details, Cosmos DB connection strings, alert thresholds, etc.) are managed using Azure Key Vault for secure storage and access control.  The backup agent retrieves these configurations from Key Vault at runtime.

**6. Scaling Strategy:**

The Azure Blob Storage automatically scales to accommodate increasing storage needs.  The backup agent can be scaled out horizontally by adding more instances to the Azure Automation account if necessary.  This ensures high availability and prevents performance bottlenecks.

**7. Monitoring Setup:**

Azure Monitor logs all backup activities, including start times, durations, success/failure status, and any errors encountered.  Custom dashboards are created to visualize key metrics and provide real-time insights into the backup process.  Alerting is configured to trigger notifications for critical events like backup failures or storage threshold violations.

**8. Backup and Recovery:**

* **Backup Strategy:** Incremental or differential backups will be used to minimize storage space and backup time. Full backups will be performed periodically (e.g., monthly).
* **Recovery Process:**  The recovery process involves restoring the backup from Azure Blob Storage to the recovery environment.  Post-restore validation checks ensure data integrity.  Automated recovery testing is scheduled regularly in the recovery environment.

**9. Disaster Recovery:**

Geo-redundant Azure Blob Storage ensures backups are replicated to a secondary region.  In case of a regional outage, the backups can be restored from the secondary region.  The recovery environment is located in a different region to provide geographical redundancy.

**10. Maintenance Procedures:**

* **Regular Updates:** The backup agent script and associated components are updated regularly to incorporate bug fixes and security patches.
* **Capacity Planning:**  Regular monitoring of storage usage and performance metrics is conducted to ensure sufficient capacity and performance.
* **Security Audits:** Regular security audits are performed to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.


**Dependencies:**

* Azure Subscription
* Azure Automation Account
* Azure Blob Storage
* Azure Cosmos DB
* Azure Key Vault
* Azure Monitor
* PowerShell (or equivalent scripting language)


**Diagram:**  A diagram illustrating the architecture components and their interactions would be beneficial here.  This could be a simple block diagram or a more detailed architecture diagram using tools like draw.io or Lucidchart.  It would show the data flow from the backup source to storage, the role of the backup agent, monitoring, and the recovery process.
