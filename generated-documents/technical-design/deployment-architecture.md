## Deployment Architecture Document: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**1. Deployment Overview**

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) is a Node.js application deployed as a microservice.  This document outlines the deployment architecture focusing on a cloud-based deployment (Azure is assumed due to project dependencies), although on-premise deployment is possible with modifications. The deployment strategy emphasizes continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) for rapid iteration and reliable releases.  The application consists of an API server and a CLI tool.  Both components are deployed independently but share common infrastructure components.

**2. Infrastructure Architecture**

The target infrastructure is Azure, leveraging the following services:

* **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):**  Hosts the RGA API server as containerized microservices.  This provides scalability, high availability, and automated management.
* **Azure Container Registry (ACR):** Stores the Docker images of the RGA API server and CLI tool.
* **Azure DevOps:** Manages the CI/CD pipeline, including code build, testing, and deployment.
* **Azure Blob Storage:** Stores logs, generated documents, and other application artifacts.  This is scalable and cost-effective for large amounts of data.
* **Azure Key Vault:** Securely stores sensitive information like API keys for AI providers and database credentials.
* **Azure Monitor:** Collects metrics and logs for monitoring application health and performance.
* **Azure Application Insights:** Provides detailed insights into application performance and helps identify bottlenecks.
* **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD):**  Manages user authentication and authorization for access to the RGA API and potentially SharePoint integration.

**3. Environment Setup**

Three environments are defined:

* **Development:** Used for local development and testing.  Uses local Docker and potentially a local database.
* **Staging:** A replica of the production environment for testing before deployment.
* **Production:** The live environment accessible to users.

Each environment utilizes the same infrastructure components but with distinct configurations managed through Azure Key Vault and environment variables.


**4. Deployment Process**

The CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps automates the deployment process:

1. **Code Commit:** Developers commit code changes to the main branch.
2. **Build:** Azure DevOps builds the application, runs unit and integration tests, and creates Docker images.
3. **Image Push:** The Docker images are pushed to ACR.
4. **Deployment to Staging:** The images are deployed to the staging AKS cluster.  Automated tests are run in the staging environment.
5. **Manual Approval (Optional):**  A manual approval step might be included before deploying to production.
6. **Deployment to Production:** The images are deployed to the production AKS cluster using a rolling update strategy to minimize downtime.


**5. Configuration Management**

Configuration is managed primarily through environment variables and Azure Key Vault.  Sensitive information like API keys and database connection strings are stored securely in Azure Key Vault and accessed by the application using managed identities.


**6. Scaling Strategy**

AKS allows for automatic horizontal scaling based on resource utilization.  The number of pods running the RGA API server can be automatically adjusted based on CPU usage, memory consumption, and request rate.


**7. Monitoring Setup**

Azure Monitor and Application Insights provide comprehensive monitoring capabilities.  Custom dashboards are created to visualize key metrics such as API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.  Alerts are configured to notify the operations team of any potential issues.


**8. Backup and Recovery**

* **Application Data:**  Generated documents and other application data are stored in Azure Blob Storage, which provides built-in redundancy and replication.
* **Database:** If a database is used (e.g., for storing templates or user data), a regular backup strategy is implemented. Azure SQL Database offers point-in-time restore capabilities.
* **AKS Cluster:** AKS provides automatic backups of the Kubernetes cluster state.

**9. Disaster Recovery**

Azure's global infrastructure provides inherent disaster recovery capabilities.  The AKS cluster can be deployed in multiple availability zones or regions for high availability and geo-redundancy.  Azure Blob Storage also offers geo-redundant storage options.


**10. Maintenance Procedures**

Regular maintenance includes:

* **Software Updates:**  Regularly update the RGA application and its dependencies.
* **Security Patches:** Apply security patches promptly to address vulnerabilities.
* **Performance Tuning:** Monitor performance and optimize the application as needed.
* **Log Analysis:** Regularly review logs to identify and address any issues.


**Dependencies:**  The project's dependencies (listed in the project context) are managed through npm and are included in the Docker images.  Dependencies are pinned to specific versions to ensure consistency across environments.  The deployment process includes dependency verification steps to avoid conflicts.

**Security:**  Security is a paramount concern.  The architecture incorporates several security measures, including:

* Secure storage of credentials in Azure Key Vault.
* Use of managed identities for accessing Azure services.
* Implementation of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Regular security scanning and penetration testing.
* Network security groups and other network security controls.


This deployment architecture provides a robust, scalable, and secure platform for the Requirements Gathering Agent.  The use of cloud-native services simplifies management and allows for easy scaling to meet future demands.
