## Database Schema Design Document: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Database Overview:**

The ADPA database will be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) designed to store project metadata, generated documents, user configurations, and system logs.  The schema is designed for scalability and maintainability, utilizing normalization techniques to minimize data redundancy and ensure data integrity.  The database will support multiple concurrent users and high-volume data ingestion, particularly during document generation.

**2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):**

*(Insert ERD diagram here.  Tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or ERwin can be used to create this diagram. The ERD should visually represent the entities and their relationships as described below.)*

**3. Entity Relationships:**

The core entities and their relationships are as follows:

* **Projects:**  A central entity representing individual projects.  Each project has a unique ID, name, description, creation date, and other relevant metadata.
* **Users:**  Represents users of the ADPA system.  Each user has a unique ID, username, password (hashed and salted), and potentially roles and permissions.
* **Documents:**  Stores generated documents. Each document has a unique ID, project ID (foreign key), document type, creation date, content (stored as text or potentially in a separate BLOB storage for large files), and a version number.
* **DocumentTypes:**  A lookup table defining the various types of documents generated by ADPA (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, Technical Design Document, etc.).
* **AIProviders:**  A lookup table defining the supported AI providers (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* **Configurations:** Stores user-specific configurations, such as preferred AI providers, output formats, and document templates. Each configuration is linked to a user ID.
* **Logs:**  Records system events, including document generation attempts, errors, and user actions. Each log entry includes a timestamp, user ID (if applicable), event type, and details.
* **SourceFiles:** This entity will store information about the markdown files discovered and analyzed during the project analysis phase. It will include the file path, relevance score, categorization (primary, planning, etc.), and last modified date.  This allows for tracking of source files and their contribution to generated documents.

Relationships:

* One-to-many relationship between Projects and Documents (one project can have many documents).
* One-to-many relationship between Users and Configurations (one user can have many configurations).
* One-to-many relationship between Projects and SourceFiles (one project can have many source files).
* Many-to-one relationship between Documents and DocumentTypes (many documents can belong to one document type).
* Many-to-one relationship between Documents and AIProviders (many documents can be generated using one AI provider).
* One-to-many relationship between Users and Logs (one user can have many log entries).


**4. Table Definitions:**

*(Detailed table definitions will follow.  Each table will have a list of columns with their data types and constraints.)*

**Example Table Definitions:**

| Table Name      | Column Name        | Data Type     | Constraints                               |
|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Projects        | project_id         | INT            | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT                |
|                 | project_name       | VARCHAR(255)   | NOT NULL                                   |
|                 | project_description | TEXT           |                                           |
|                 | created_at         | TIMESTAMP      | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP                 |
| Documents       | document_id        | INT            | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT                |
|                 | project_id         | INT            | FOREIGN KEY (Projects)                     |
|                 | document_type_id   | INT            | FOREIGN KEY (DocumentTypes)                |
|                 | ai_provider_id     | INT            | FOREIGN KEY (AIProviders)                  |
|                 | created_at         | TIMESTAMP      | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP                 |
|                 | content            | TEXT           |                                           |
|                 | version            | INT            | DEFAULT 1                                 |


**5. Data Types:**

Standard SQL data types will be used (INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, etc.), chosen appropriately for each column based on the expected data.  Consider using appropriate character sets and collations for internationalization.

**6. Indexes and Keys:**

Appropriate indexes will be created to optimize query performance.  Primary keys will be defined for each table, and foreign keys will enforce referential integrity between related tables.  Indexes should be created on frequently queried columns, particularly foreign keys.

**7. Constraints:**

Constraints, including `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`, and `FOREIGN KEY`, will be used to ensure data integrity and validity.

**8. Normalization Strategy:**

The database schema will be designed using at least the third normal form (3NF) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.  Further normalization (e.g., Boyce-Codd Normal Form) may be considered based on specific requirements and data analysis.

**9. Performance Considerations:**

* **Indexing:**  Strategic indexing will be crucial for performance.
* **Query Optimization:**  Regular review and optimization of queries will be necessary.
* **Database Tuning:**  Appropriate database configuration and tuning will be performed.
* **Sharding/Partitioning:**  Consider database sharding or partitioning for extremely large datasets.
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) to reduce database load.

**10. Data Migration Strategy:**

A phased data migration approach will be used, starting with a small subset of data to test the migration process before migrating the entire dataset.  Data validation and error handling will be incorporated into the migration process.

**11. Backup and Recovery:**

Regular database backups will be implemented, utilizing a robust backup and recovery strategy to ensure data availability and prevent data loss.  This will include both full and incremental backups, stored in a secure and geographically redundant location.


This document provides a high-level overview.  A more detailed schema with specific column definitions, data types, indexes, and constraints will be developed during the detailed design phase.  The final schema will be subject to change based on further analysis and requirements refinement.
