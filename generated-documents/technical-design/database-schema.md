## Database Schema Design Document: ADPA - Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework

**1. Database Overview:**

ADPA requires a robust database to manage users, configurations, generated documents, AI interactions, and integrations with external systems like Confluence and SharePoint.  Given the diverse data types and potential scale, a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) is recommended for its ACID properties and mature tooling.  NoSQL options could be considered for specific components (e.g., document storage) if performance bottlenecks arise in the future.  This design prioritizes scalability and maintainability.

**2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):**

*(Placeholder for ERD diagram.  A visual ERD would be included here, generated using a tool like Lucidchart, draw.io, or similar.  The diagram would show the entities and their relationships as described below.)*


**3. Table Definitions:**

The following tables are proposed, with further detail provided in subsequent sections:

* **Users:** Stores user information, including authentication details.
* **Projects:** Manages project metadata.
* **Documents:** Stores generated documents and their metadata.
* **Templates:** Contains document templates.
* **AIProviders:** Manages configurations for different AI providers.
* **AIRequests:** Logs AI requests and responses.
* **Integrations:** Stores configuration details for external integrations (Confluence, SharePoint, etc.).
* **Roles:** Defines user roles and permissions.
* **UserRoles:**  A many-to-many junction table linking Users and Roles.
* **ProjectMembers:** A many-to-many junction table linking Projects and Users.
* **DocumentVersions:** Tracks versions of generated documents.


**4. Data Types and Table Details:**

*(This table definition would continue for all tables listed above, including appropriate data types and constraints.  The `content` column in the `Documents` table might require a different approach, such as storing file paths or using a separate storage system like cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) for large files.)*


**5. Indexes and Keys:**

Appropriate indexes would be created on foreign keys and frequently queried columns (e.g., `project_id`, `document_type`, `username`, `email`) to optimize query performance.  Unique constraints would be enforced where necessary (e.g., `username`, `email`).


**6. Constraints:**

Foreign key constraints would be used to enforce referential integrity between tables.  Check constraints would be used to validate data (e.g., email format).  Not NULL constraints would be applied to essential columns.


**7. Normalization Strategy:**

The database would be normalized to at least the 3rd normal form (3NF) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.


**8. Performance Considerations:**

* **Indexing:**  Strategic indexing is crucial for query performance.
* **Query Optimization:**  Regular review and optimization of queries.
* **Database Tuning:**  Appropriate configuration of database parameters.
* **Caching:**  Implementation of caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
* **Database Sharding:**  Consider sharding for extreme scalability needs.


**9. Data Migration Strategy:**

A detailed data migration plan would be developed, outlining the process for migrating existing data (if any) to the new database schema.  This would include data validation, transformation, and loading steps.


**10. Backup and Recovery:**

Regular database backups and a comprehensive disaster recovery plan are essential.  The specific backup and recovery strategy would depend on the chosen database system and infrastructure.


This schema provides a foundation for ADPA's database.  Further refinement may be necessary based on evolving requirements and performance testing.  The ERD is a critical component that needs to be fully fleshed out to visualize the relationships between all the entities.  This document provides a starting point for a robust and scalable database solution.
