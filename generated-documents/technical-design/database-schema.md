## Database Schema Design Document: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Database Overview:**

This document outlines the database schema for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) application. The database will be a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) chosen for its scalability, ACID properties, and robust tooling.  The schema is designed to support the core functionalities of the RGA, including user management, document generation, template management, AI provider integration, and integration with external services like SharePoint.  The schema prioritizes data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying.

**2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):**

[Insert ERD Diagram Here]  *(This section requires a visual ERD diagram.  Tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or database modeling tools can generate this. The diagram should visually represent the entities and relationships described below.)*

**3. Table Definitions:**

The following tables are proposed to capture the core data:

**4. Data Types:**

Standard SQL data types will be used (INT, VARCHAR, TEXT, JSON, TIMESTAMP, ENUM). The specific data type sizes will be adjusted based on the anticipated data volume and the chosen database system.  JSON is used to store complex, semi-structured data like template and document content.

**5. Indexes and Keys:**

Primary keys and foreign keys will be defined for all tables to enforce referential integrity.  Indexes will be added to frequently queried columns (e.g., `user_id`, `template_id`, `created_at`) to optimize query performance.

**6. Constraints:**

Appropriate constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY) will be defined to maintain data integrity and enforce business rules.  ENUMs will be used to restrict values for status and role fields.

**7. Normalization Strategy:**

The schema will follow a normalized design (likely 3NF) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.  This involves separating data into logical tables with clear relationships.

**8. Performance Considerations:**

* **Indexing:**  Appropriate indexes will be created to speed up query performance.
* **Database Choice:** A performant database system (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) will be chosen.
* **Query Optimization:**  Queries will be reviewed and optimized as needed.
* **Caching:**  Caching mechanisms may be implemented to reduce database load.
* **Sharding:** For extremely high data volumes, sharding could be considered.

**9. Data Migration Strategy:**

A detailed data migration plan will be developed, including data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes.  This plan will address potential data inconsistencies and ensure a smooth transition.

**10. Backup and Recovery:**

Regular database backups will be implemented to protect against data loss.  A robust recovery plan will be defined to ensure data can be restored quickly and efficiently in case of failure.


This schema provides a foundation for the RGA database.  Further refinements may be necessary based on evolving project requirements and performance testing.  The ERD is crucial for a complete understanding of the relationships between entities. Remember to replace the placeholder with a generated ERD.
