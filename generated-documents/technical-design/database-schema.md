## Database Schema Design Document: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Database Overview:**

This document outlines the database schema for Project Backup Vermigerous, designed to manage and track automated backups. The database will be relational, leveraging a robust and scalable architecture to handle growing backup metadata and facilitate efficient recovery.  The target database system is assumed to be PostgreSQL, but the schema can be adapted for other relational databases with minor modifications.

**2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):**

*(Insert ERD diagram here.  Tools like Lucidchart, draw.io, or dbdiagram.io can be used to create the ERD. The ERD should visually represent the tables and their relationships as described below.)*

**3. Table Definitions:**

The database will comprise the following tables:

* **Projects:** Stores information about the projects being backed up.
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for each project.
    * `project_name` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Name of the project.
    * `description` (TEXT): Description of the project.
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP): Timestamp indicating project creation.


* **Backups:** Stores metadata for each backup.
    * `backup_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for each backup.
    * `project_id` (INT, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects.project_id):  Identifier of the project this backup belongs to.
    * `backup_date` (DATE, NOT NULL): Date of the backup.
    * `backup_time` (TIMESTAMP, NOT NULL): Timestamp of the backup.
    * `backup_type` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL): Type of backup (e.g., 'Full', 'Incremental', 'Differential').
    * `backup_location` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Location of the backup (e.g., Azure Blob storage path).
    * `backup_size` (BIGINT): Size of the backup in bytes.
    * `checksum` (VARCHAR(64), NOT NULL): SHA-256 checksum of the backup for integrity verification.
    * `status` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL): Status of the backup (e.g., 'Success', 'Failed', 'In Progress').
    * `error_message` (TEXT): Error message if the backup failed.


* **Backup_Metadata:** Stores additional metadata associated with a backup.
    * `metadata_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for each metadata entry.
    * `backup_id` (INT, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY referencing Backups.backup_id): Backup this metadata belongs to.
    * `key` (VARCHAR(255), NOT NULL): Metadata key.
    * `value` (TEXT): Metadata value.


* **Restore_Tests:** Stores results of automated restore tests.
    * `test_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT): Unique identifier for each test.
    * `backup_id` (INT, NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY referencing Backups.backup_id): Backup used for the test.
    * `test_date` (TIMESTAMP, NOT NULL): Date and time of the test.
    * `status` (VARCHAR(50), NOT NULL): Status of the test (e.g., 'Success', 'Failed').
    * `duration` (INT): Duration of the test in seconds.
    * `error_message` (TEXT): Error message if the test failed.


**4. Data Types:**

Data types are chosen to optimize storage and performance based on expected data characteristics.  The choices above reflect this consideration.

**5. Indexes and Keys:**

* **Primary Keys:**  Each table has a primary key defined as noted above, ensuring unique identification of records.
* **Foreign Keys:** Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity between related tables (e.g., `project_id` in `Backups` referencing `Projects`).
* **Indexes:** Indexes will be created on frequently queried columns such as `project_id`, `backup_date`, and `status` to improve query performance.  Specific index creation will depend on query patterns observed during operation.

**6. Constraints:**

* **NOT NULL Constraints:**  `NOT NULL` constraints are used for critical columns to ensure data integrity.
* **Foreign Key Constraints:**  Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity between tables.
* **Check Constraints:**  Check constraints could be used to enforce data validity (e.g., ensuring `backup_type` only contains valid values).


**7. Normalization Strategy:**

The schema is designed using a normalized approach (likely 3NF) to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.  The `Backup_Metadata` table allows for flexible storage of additional project-specific metadata without modifying the core `Backups` table structure.

**8. Performance Considerations:**

* **Indexing:** Strategic indexing is crucial for query performance.
* **Data Partitioning:** For very large datasets, partitioning the `Backups` table by year or month could improve query performance.
* **Database Tuning:** Regular database monitoring and tuning will be necessary to optimize performance.

**9. Data Migration Strategy:**

A phased migration approach is recommended.  Start by migrating existing backup metadata into the new database.  Subsequently, configure the backup process to populate the database with new backup information.

**10. Backup and Recovery:**

The database itself will require regular backups using appropriate mechanisms provided by the database system (e.g., `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL).  These backups should be stored securely and independently of the main database server for disaster recovery purposes.  The backup and recovery strategy should align with the overall Project Backup Vermigerous strategy.


This schema provides a solid foundation for managing backup metadata.  Further refinements might be necessary based on evolving project requirements and operational experience.  Regular review and optimization of the schema will be important to ensure continued efficiency and scalability.
