## Database Schema Design Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Database Overview:**

This document outlines the database schema for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent. The database will store information related to users, templates, jobs, and generated documents.  The chosen database system is PostgreSQL (due to its scalability, robust features, and JSON support), but the schema could be adapted for other relational databases with minor modifications.  The schema is designed for scalability and maintainability, employing normalization techniques to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

**2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):**

*(Placeholder for ERD diagram.  A visual ERD would be generated using a tool like draw.io, Lucidchart, or similar, and included here.)*

The ERD would show the relationships between the following entities:

* **Users:** Stores information about registered users.
* **Templates:** Stores information about document templates.
* **Jobs:** Tracks the status of document generation jobs.
* **Documents:** Stores metadata and potentially partial content of generated documents (large documents would likely be stored externally, with only metadata in the database).
* **AI Providers:**  A lookup table for supported AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* **Job Logs:** Detailed logs for each job, including timestamps, status changes, and error messages.


**3. Table Definitions:**

| Table Name       | Column Name          | Data Type             | Constraints                               | Description                                                                    |

**4. Data Types:**

Standard PostgreSQL data types are used as shown in the table above.  JSONB is used for flexible storage of structured data like template data, input data, and metadata.

**5. Indexes and Keys:**

Appropriate indexes will be created on foreign key columns and frequently queried columns (e.g., `user_id`, `template_id`, `status` in the `jobs` table) to optimize query performance.  Unique constraints are used where necessary to ensure data integrity.

**6. Constraints:**

Check constraints are used to enforce data validity (e.g., ensuring that the `status` column in the `jobs` table only contains valid values).  Foreign key constraints are used to maintain referential integrity between tables.

**7. Normalization Strategy:**

The schema is designed using a normalized approach (likely 3NF or higher) to minimize redundancy and improve data integrity.

**8. Performance Considerations:**

* **Indexing:**  Strategic indexing will be crucial for performance.
* **Query Optimization:**  Careful consideration of query design will be necessary.
* **Database Tuning:**  PostgreSQL's built-in tuning features will be used.
* **Caching:**  Caching mechanisms (either database-level or application-level) might be implemented for frequently accessed data.
* **Partitioning:** For extremely large datasets, partitioning might be considered.


**9. Data Migration Strategy:**

A phased migration approach will be adopted, starting with a small subset of data and gradually migrating the entire dataset.  Data validation will be performed at each stage.

**10. Backup and Recovery:**

Regular database backups will be performed, and a robust recovery plan will be in place to ensure data availability in case of failures.  PostgreSQL's built-in backup and recovery mechanisms will be leveraged.


This schema provides a solid foundation for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent database.  Further refinements might be necessary based on evolving project requirements and performance testing.  The ERD diagram is a critical missing component that would visually clarify the relationships between the tables and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the database structure.
