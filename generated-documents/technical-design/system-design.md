## System Design Specification: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Senior Software Architect


**1. Introduction**

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA) is a revolutionary enterprise-grade platform designed to automate the business analysis process.  It leverages AI to generate BABOK v3-compliant frameworks, stakeholder maps, and regulatory compliance documentation in seconds. This document outlines the system's purpose, architecture, modules, interfaces, data structures, and other key design aspects.


**2. System Purpose and Scope**

The ADPA-RGA aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required for requirements gathering in large-scale projects.  Its primary function is to generate comprehensive business analysis documentation based on input data representing project context, stakeholders, and regulatory requirements. The system's scope includes:

* **Requirements Elicitation:** Gathering and documenting functional and non-functional requirements.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identifying and analyzing stakeholders and their influence.
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Integrating relevant regulatory frameworks (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* **Document Generation:** Producing various output formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML, JSON).
* **API-First Design:** Providing a RESTful API for integration with other systems.

**3. System Architecture**

The ADPA-RGA employs a microservices-ready architecture, although currently implemented as a monolithic application for simplicity.  Key components include:

* **API Gateway:**  Handles incoming requests, authentication, authorization, and routing.  (Express.js)
* **Document Processing Service:** Core logic for generating documents based on templates and input data.  (Includes AI model interaction)
* **Data Validation Service:** Ensures data integrity and compliance with defined schemas. (Zod)
* **Job Management Service:** Manages asynchronous document generation tasks and tracks their progress.
* **Database:** Stores templates, user data, and job information. (Currently unspecified, but should be scalable)
* **AI Provider Interface:** Abstracts interaction with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).

**4. Module Descriptions**

* **API Gateway Module:**  Implements authentication (API keys, JWT), rate limiting, request validation, and routing to other services. Utilizes Express.js middleware for security and efficiency.
* **Document Processing Module:** This module is the core of the system. It takes input data, applies the selected template, and leverages AI models to generate the final document.  It handles template selection, data transformation, and document generation in the chosen format.  This module interacts heavily with the AI Provider Interface.
* **Data Validation Module:**  Uses Zod schemas to validate input data and ensure consistency.  This prevents invalid data from reaching the document processing module.
* **Job Management Module:**  Implements a queuing system (e.g., Redis) to manage asynchronous jobs. It provides APIs for tracking job status and retrieving results.
* **AI Provider Interface Module:**  Provides an abstraction layer to interact with different AI providers.  This allows for easy swapping of providers and supports fallback mechanisms in case of failure.


**5. Interface Specifications**

The system exposes a RESTful API (OpenAPI 3.0 specification available at `api-specs/`). Key endpoints include:

* `/api/v1/health`: Health check endpoint.
* `/api/v1/documents/convert`:  POST endpoint to initiate document generation.  Requires input data (JSON) and template ID.
* `/api/v1/documents/jobs`: GET endpoint to list ongoing jobs.
* `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`: GET endpoint to retrieve the status of a specific job.
* `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}`: GET endpoint to download a generated document.
* `/api/v1/templates`:  Endpoints for managing templates (CRUD operations).

**6. Data Structures**

* **Input Data (JSON):**  A structured JSON object containing project information, stakeholder details, regulatory requirements, and other relevant data.  The exact schema will be defined in the OpenAPI specification.
* **Template Data (JSON):**  JSON representation of document templates, including placeholders for dynamic content.
* **Job Data (JSON):**  Contains job ID, status, progress, input data, output location, and error messages (if any).


**7. Processing Logic**

1. **Request Reception:** The API gateway receives the request, validates authentication, and routes it to the Document Processing Service.
2. **Data Validation:** The Data Validation Service validates the input data against predefined schemas.
3. **Job Creation:** A new job is created in the Job Management Service.
4. **Document Generation:** The Document Processing Service uses the selected template and AI models to generate the document.
5. **Job Update:** The Job Management Service updates the job status and progress.
6. **Result Storage:** The generated document is stored (location depends on configuration).
7. **Response:** The API gateway returns a response containing the job ID.


**8. Error Handling**

The system implements comprehensive error handling throughout. Errors are logged with detailed information, and appropriate HTTP status codes are returned to the client.  Error responses include user-friendly messages and potential troubleshooting steps.

**9. Performance Requirements**

The system should be able to generate documents within a few seconds for typical enterprise scenarios.  Scalability is crucial for handling multiple concurrent requests.  Performance testing will be conducted to ensure responsiveness.


**10. System Constraints**

* **AI Provider Availability:**  The system's performance depends on the availability and responsiveness of the selected AI provider.
* **Data Input Format:**  Strict adherence to the defined input data schema is required.
* **Template Compatibility:**  Templates must follow the defined structure and formatting.


**11. Dependencies**

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Zod
* [AI Provider SDKs]
* [Database System]


**12. Future Considerations**

* **Improved AI Model Integration:** Exploring more advanced AI models for enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
* **Multi-Tenant Support:**  Enabling multiple organizations to use the system simultaneously.
* **Enhanced Reporting and Analytics:**  Providing tools for analyzing generated documents and extracting insights.


This System Design Specification provides a high-level overview of the ADPA-RGA. More detailed design documents will be created for individual modules as the project progresses.
