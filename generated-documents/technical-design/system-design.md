## System Design Specification: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the system design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a tool that leverages AI to generate comprehensive project documentation based on project context extracted from various sources, primarily the project's README and associated files.  ADPA adheres to PMBOK 7.0 standards and offers a modular architecture for extensibility.

**2. System Goals and Objectives**

* **Automate Project Documentation:**  Reduce manual effort in creating project documentation.
* **Ensure PMBOK Compliance:** Generate documents adhering to Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) 7.0 standards.
* **Enhance Documentation Quality:**  Improve accuracy and consistency of project documentation through AI assistance.
* **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Offer flexibility by integrating with various AI services (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
* **Modular and Extensible Design:** Allow easy addition of new document types and AI providers.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Provide a simple command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction.
* **Comprehensive Context Analysis:**  Gather project information from diverse sources beyond just the README.


**3. System Scope**

ADPA encompasses the following functionalities:

* **Context Extraction and Analysis:**  Extracts and analyzes project context from README, associated markdown files, and project configuration files.  This includes relevance scoring of sources.
* **Document Generation:** Generates a wide array of PMBOK-compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, Scope Statement, etc.) and specialized technical documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, etc.).
* **AI Provider Integration:**  Connects to and utilizes multiple AI providers for text generation and analysis.
* **Document Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards and internal quality metrics.
* **Version Control:** Tracks changes to generated documents using Git.
* **CLI Interface:** Provides a command-line interface for user interaction and document generation.
* **Modular Architecture:** Uses a plugin-based architecture for easy extension and customization.


**4. System Architecture**

ADPA employs a layered architecture:

* **Presentation Layer (CLI):**  Provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.  This layer handles user input, option parsing, and output formatting.  Uses Node.js and TypeScript.
* **Application Layer:** This layer orchestrates the entire process. It handles context extraction, AI provider selection, document generation, validation, and version control.  This layer is implemented in TypeScript.
* **Business Logic Layer:** Contains core logic for context analysis, document template selection, and data transformation. This layer is implemented in TypeScript.
* **Data Access Layer:** Handles interactions with external systems, including AI providers and the local file system.  It includes abstraction layers for AI providers. This layer is implemented in TypeScript with appropriate provider-specific SDKs.
* **Data Layer (Persistent Storage):**  While the current implementation focuses on file-system based storage of generated documents, future iterations could incorporate a persistent database for document history and management.


**5. Module Descriptions**

* **ContextManager:**  Responsible for gathering, analyzing, and managing project context.  This module scores and prioritizes information from various sources.
* **AIProvider:** An abstract base class defining the interface for different AI providers.  Concrete implementations (AzureOpenAIProvider, GoogleAIProvider, etc.) will extend this class.
* **DocumentGenerator:** Generates documents based on templates and AI-generated content.  This module uses a template engine (e.g., Handlebars) and incorporates PMBOK-specific checks.
* **DocumentValidator:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards and internal quality metrics.
* **VersionControl:** Manages version control for generated documents using Git.
* **CLI:** Handles command-line arguments, user input, and output.
* **ProcessorFactory:** A factory pattern for creating document processors, allowing for modular addition of new document types.


**6. Interface Specifications**

* **CLI Interface:**  Uses command-line arguments to specify document types, AI provider, output directory, etc.  Supports both batch generation and individual document creation.
* **AI Provider Interfaces:** Defines standardized methods for interacting with different AI providers (e.g., `generateText`, `getCompletion`).
* **ContextManager Interface:** Defines methods for retrieving, analyzing, and scoring project context.


**7. Data Structures**

* **ProjectContext:** A data structure representing the extracted project context, including a weighted list of relevant files and their content.
* **DocumentTemplate:** A data structure representing a document template, including placeholders for AI-generated content.
* **GeneratedDocument:** A data structure representing a generated document, including metadata (e.g., timestamp, AI provider used).


**8. Processing Logic**

1. **Context Extraction:** The system scans specified directories (configurable) for relevant files (README.md, markdown files, etc.), analyzes their content, and assigns relevance scores.
2. **Context Aggregation:**  The relevant context is combined and passed to the AI provider.
3. **AI-Assisted Generation:** The AI provider generates text content based on the provided context and document templates.
4. **Document Assembly:** The generated text is inserted into the appropriate document templates.
5. **Document Validation:** The generated document is validated against PMBOK standards and internal quality metrics.
6. **Version Control:** The generated document is committed to a local Git repository.
7. **Output:** The generated document is saved to the specified output directory.


**9. Error Handling**

* **AI Provider Errors:**  Handles errors during AI API calls (e.g., rate limits, API failures) using retry mechanisms and fallback strategies.
* **File I/O Errors:**  Handles errors during file reading and writing.
* **Validation Errors:**  Reports validation errors and provides suggestions for improvement.
* **General Exceptions:**  Provides informative error messages and logging for debugging.


**10. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time:**  Document generation should complete within a reasonable timeframe (depending on document complexity and AI provider).
* **Scalability:**  The system should be able to handle large projects with extensive documentation.
* **Resource Usage:**  The system should be efficient in its use of CPU, memory, and network resources.


**11. System Constraints**

* **AI Provider Limitations:**  The system is subject to the limitations of the chosen AI provider (e.g., token limits, context window size).
* **Data Dependency:**  The quality of generated documents depends on the quality and completeness of the input project context.


**12. Dependencies**

* Node.js (version 18 or higher)
* TypeScript
* Chosen AI Provider SDKs (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.)
* Git


**13. Deployment Architecture**

ADPA can be deployed as a command-line tool.  Future versions could explore cloud deployment options for enhanced scalability and accessibility.


**14. Future Enhancements**

* **Improved Context Analysis:**  More sophisticated algorithms for context extraction and relevance scoring.
* **Advanced Template Engine:**  Support for more complex document templates and customization options.
* **Integration with PM Tools:**  Integration with popular project management software (Jira, Asana, etc.).
* **User Interface:**  Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
