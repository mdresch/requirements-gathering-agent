## System Design Specification: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the system design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), an AI-powered tool generating comprehensive project management documentation based on project context derived from various sources, primarily a project's README file and associated documentation.  ADPA adheres to PMBOK 7.0 standards and supports multiple AI providers. This design emphasizes modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

**2. System Goals**

* **Automate Documentation:** Generate PMBOK-compliant project documents automatically.
* **Improve Accuracy:** Leverage AI to reduce errors and inconsistencies in documentation.
* **Enhance Consistency:** Ensure consistency in terminology and formatting across documents.
* **Support Multiple AI Providers:** Offer flexibility in choosing AI models and services.
* **Modular Design:** Allow for easy expansion and maintenance of the system.
* **Comprehensive Context Analysis:**  Analyze project context from multiple sources beyond just the README.
* **High Context Utilization:** Maximize the use of available context tokens for improved AI performance.
* **Version Control:** Track changes to generated documents for auditing and traceability.


**3. System Scope**

ADPA encompasses the following functionalities:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Intelligently discovers and analyzes all relevant markdown files within a specified project directory, scoring them for relevance.
* **Enhanced Context Management:**  A three-phase context strategy optimizes context provision to different AI models.
* **AI-Powered Document Generation:** Generates a suite of PMBOK-compliant documents using specified AI providers.  This includes core project documents, planning artifacts, management plans, and stakeholder management documents.
* **Technical Design Document Generation:** Generates a suite of technical design documents (architecture, system design, database schema, API documentation, etc.).
* **Strategic Document Generation:** Generates strategic business documents (company values, purpose statements, etc.).
* **PMBOK Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards and provides quality assessments.
* **Version Control System:** Integrates a local git repository for managing generated document versions.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the system.


**4. System Architecture**

ADPA employs a microservice-like architecture with distinct modules communicating via well-defined interfaces.

![ADPA System Architecture](architecture_diagram.png)  *(Diagram placeholder -  A diagram should be included here showing the interaction between the modules:  Project Analyzer, Context Manager, AI Provider Interface, Document Generator, Validator, Version Control, and CLI)*


**4.1 Modules:**

* **Project Analyzer:**  This module scans the project directory, identifies relevant documentation, and scores them based on relevance to PMBOK terminology and project management concepts.  It uses regular expressions and keyword matching to identify relevant files.
* **Context Manager:**  This core module manages the project context, prioritizing and assembling relevant information from the Project Analyzer's output for optimal use by the AI models. It implements the three-phase context strategy (Core, Ultra-Large, Large Supplementary).
* **AI Provider Interface:**  This abstraction layer provides a consistent interface for interacting with different AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).  It handles API calls, authentication, error handling, and result parsing.
* **Document Generator:**  This module utilizes the context provided by the Context Manager and the AI Provider Interface to generate documents based on predefined templates.  Each document type has a dedicated processor.
* **Validator:** This module validates the generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards and provides a quality assessment score.
* **Version Control:** This module manages the version history of generated documents using a local git repository.
* **CLI:**  This module provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the system, specifying options for document generation, provider selection, validation, and version control.


**5. Data Model**

* **Project Context:** A JSON object representing the assembled project context, including extracted text from relevant files, metadata about these files (path, relevance score, type), and other relevant information.
* **Document Template:**  JSON objects defining the structure and content of each document type.  These templates are used by the Document Generator.
* **AI Provider Configuration:** A JSON object containing the configuration parameters for each supported AI provider (API keys, endpoints, model names, etc.).
* **Generated Document:**  A JSON object representing the generated document, containing the document's content, metadata (creation timestamp, AI provider used, validation results), and version information.


**6. Interface Specifications**

* **Project Analyzer to Context Manager:** The Project Analyzer provides a list of relevant files and their associated metadata to the Context Manager.
* **Context Manager to AI Provider Interface:** The Context Manager sends the assembled project context to the AI Provider Interface.
* **AI Provider Interface to Document Generator:** The AI Provider Interface returns the AI-generated text to the Document Generator.
* **Document Generator to Validator:** The Document Generator sends the generated document to the Validator for PMBOK compliance checks.
* **Validator to Document Generator:** The Validator returns the validation results and quality assessment to the Document Generator.
* **Document Generator to Version Control:** The Document Generator sends the generated document to the Version Control module for versioning.
* **All Modules to CLI:**  All modules report progress and results to the CLI for user feedback.


**7. Technology Stack**

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI,  (potentially others)
* **Database:**  No persistent database is required for core functionality; generated documents are stored in the file system.  A database could be added for scalability.
* **Testing Framework:** Jest
* **Version Control:** Git


**8. Error Handling**

ADPA employs robust error handling throughout the system.  Error conditions are handled gracefully, with informative error messages provided to the user via the CLI.  Retry mechanisms are implemented for transient errors related to AI provider API calls.  Logging is used for debugging and monitoring.


**9. Deployment**

ADPA can be deployed as a command-line tool, installable via npm.  Future scalability could involve a cloud-based deployment.


**10. Future Enhancements**

* **Support for Additional Document Types:** Expand the range of documents generated.
* **Improved Context Analysis:**  Refine the project analysis algorithms to improve relevance scoring and context extraction.
* **Enhanced AI Model Selection:**  Implement AI model selection based on project context.
* **Integration with Project Management Tools:**  Integrate with popular project management platforms.
* **GUI:** Develop a graphical user interface.


**11. Appendix (Technical Diagrams and Detailed Module Specifications)**

*(This section would include detailed diagrams and specifications for each module, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and API specifications.)*


This System Design Specification provides a high-level overview of the ADPA system.  Further detailed design documents will be created for each module as the project progresses.
