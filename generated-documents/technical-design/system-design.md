## System Design Specification: Project Backup Vermigerous

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the system design for Project Backup Vermigerous, a system designed to automate monthly backups of project data, ensure data integrity, and enable secure recovery in case of system failure.  The system prioritizes automation, security, and efficient storage.

**1.2 Scope:** This design covers the automated backup process, including scheduling, backup type, validation, secure storage, metadata management, recovery testing, and monitoring.  It does *not* cover the specific applications or data being backed up (this is assumed to be defined elsewhere).

**2. System Overview**

Project Backup Vermigerous will perform automated monthly backups, categorizing them by year and month. The system will utilize incremental or differential backups to minimize storage space and backup time. Data integrity will be verified through checksum generation and validation. Backups will be stored securely in immutable storage with encryption at rest and in transit.  Automated recovery testing and monitoring will ensure system reliability.

**3. System Architecture**

[Insert Diagram Here: A high-level diagram showing the key components and their interactions. This could include:  Backup Agent, Storage (e.g., Azure Blob Storage), Metadata Database (e.g., Cosmos DB), Monitoring System (e.g., Azure Monitor), and a Recovery Test Environment.  Arrows should indicate data flow.]

**3.1 Components:**

* **Backup Agent:** This component is responsible for scheduling backups, performing backups (full, incremental, or differential), generating checksums, and encrypting the backups.  It will be implemented using [Specify Technology: e.g., PowerShell script, Azure Automation account].
* **Storage:** Backups will be stored in Azure Blob Storage with a Write Once Read Many (WORM) policy to ensure immutability.  Multi-region replication will be used for disaster recovery.  [Specify Region(s)].
* **Metadata Database:** A database (e.g., Cosmos DB) will store metadata about each backup, including project name, year, month, version, checksum, and storage location.  This database will be used for backup retrieval and management.
* **Monitoring System:** Azure Monitor will be integrated to track backup status, alert on failures or delays, and monitor storage usage.  [Specify Alert Thresholds].
* **Recovery Test Environment:** A separate environment will be used to periodically test the backup and restore process.  This will ensure recoverability and identify potential issues.


**4. Module Descriptions**

**4.1 Backup Scheduling Module:** This module utilizes a scheduler (e.g., Azure Automation, cron jobs) to trigger the Backup Agent monthly.  The schedule will be configurable [Specify Configuration Method].

**4.2 Backup Execution Module:** This module performs the actual backup operation, selecting the appropriate backup type (full, incremental, or differential) based on configuration.  It will utilize [Specify Backup Technology: e.g., robocopy, rsync] and handle error conditions gracefully.

**4.3 Data Validation Module:** This module generates SHA-256 checksums for each backup and stores them in the metadata database.  Post-backup, it validates the checksums to ensure data integrity.

**4.4 Secure Storage Module:** This module interacts with Azure Blob Storage, encrypting backups at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS.  It also manages the WORM policy and multi-region replication.

**4.5 Metadata Management Module:** This module interacts with the metadata database, storing and retrieving backup metadata.

**4.6 Recovery Testing Module:** This module periodically triggers a restore operation in the recovery test environment and logs the results.  [Specify Testing Frequency].

**4.7 Monitoring and Alerting Module:** This module collects metrics from the Backup Agent and Storage, and sends alerts based on predefined thresholds.


**5. Interface Specifications**

* **Backup Agent - Storage:** The Backup Agent uses the Azure Storage SDK to upload encrypted backups to Blob Storage.
* **Backup Agent - Metadata Database:** The Backup Agent uses the appropriate database connector (e.g., Cosmos DB SDK) to store backup metadata.
* **Monitoring System - Backup Agent:** The Backup Agent exposes metrics via [Specify Method: e.g., Azure Application Insights] for monitoring.


**6. Data Structures**

* **Backup Metadata:**  A JSON document stored in the metadata database containing:
    * `projectName`: String
    * `year`: Integer
    * `month`: Integer
    * `version`: String (e.g., v1, v2)
    * `backupType`: String (full, incremental, differential)
    * `checksum`: String (SHA-256 hash)
    * `storageLocation`: String (Azure Blob Storage URI)
    * `backupTimestamp`: DateTime


**7. Processing Logic**

[Describe the sequence of events for a typical backup operation, including error handling.]


**8. Error Handling**

The system will implement robust error handling at each stage.  Errors will be logged to [Specify Logging System: e.g., Azure Log Analytics] and alerts will be triggered for critical failures.  Retrying failed operations will be considered [Specify Retry Mechanism and Limits].


**9. Performance Requirements**

* Backup completion time: [Specify Target Time]
* Restore completion time: [Specify Target Time]
* Storage usage: [Specify Target Usage]


**10. System Constraints**

* Azure subscription required.
* Network connectivity required.
* Sufficient storage capacity required.


**11. Dependencies**

* Azure subscription.
* Azure Blob Storage.
* Azure Monitor.
* [Specify other dependencies, including specific versions of libraries and tools].


**12.  Security Considerations**

* Access to Azure resources will be controlled through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* Encryption at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS) will be used.
* Regular security audits will be conducted.


This document serves as a high-level design specification.  Further detailed design documents will be created for each module as the project progresses.
