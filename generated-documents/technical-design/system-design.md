## System Design Specification: Requirements Gathering Agent (Version 2.2.0)

**1. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose:** This document specifies the design of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA), a system designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI. The system supports multiple AI providers, offers a command-line interface, and prioritizes modularity and extensibility.  This version specifically addresses the need for improved API management and enhanced customer centricity, while acknowledging the necessity for international compliance.  Security features are explicitly excluded from this version's scope (as per `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`).

**1.2 Scope:** This specification covers the design of the core RGA components, including the CLI, AI provider integration layer, document generation engine, and context management system.  It does *not* cover the details of individual AI provider APIs or the specifics of PMBOK document templates (which are considered configuration rather than core system design).  Integration with SharePoint and Confluence is considered out-of-scope for this core system design document, but their APIs are acknowledged as external dependencies.

**2. System Architecture**

[Insert System Architecture Diagram Placeholder -  This diagram should show the interaction between the CLI, Context Manager, AI Provider Interface, Document Generation Engine, and Output Modules.  Consider using a layered architecture diagram.]

**2.1 Components:**

* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provides user interaction for specifying input parameters, selecting AI providers, and managing output.  Uses `yargs` or similar library for parsing command-line arguments.
* **Context Manager:**  A central component responsible for managing the project context (input data, configuration, etc.) and passing it to the AI provider.  Uses a persistent storage mechanism (e.g., in-memory cache, file system, database - to be decided) to maintain context across multiple requests.
* **AI Provider Interface:**  An abstraction layer that allows the system to interact with different AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) using a unified interface.  This layer handles provider selection, API calls, error handling, and fallback mechanisms.
* **Document Generation Engine:** Processes the AI-generated text and templates to create the final PMBOK documents.  Uses a templating engine (e.g., Handlebars, Mustache) to dynamically populate templates with AI-generated content.  Includes schema validation to ensure PMBOK compliance.
* **Output Module:**  Handles the output of generated documents in validated JSON format.  Supports various output options (e.g., writing to files, streaming to a database, etc.).

**3. Module Descriptions**

**3.1 CLI Module:**

* **Input:** Command-line arguments (project details, AI provider, output options, etc.).
* **Processing:** Parses command-line arguments, validates input, and passes the validated data to the Context Manager.
* **Output:** Displays progress messages, errors, and success messages to the user.

**3.2 Context Manager Module:**

* **Input:** Project details from the CLI, configuration settings.
* **Processing:** Stores and manages the project context, ensuring data consistency and access across modules.  Handles context persistence.
* **Output:** Provides the project context to the AI Provider Interface.

**3.3 AI Provider Interface Module:**

* **Input:** Project context from the Context Manager, selected AI provider.
* **Processing:**  Selects the appropriate AI provider, makes API calls, handles authentication, and manages rate limits. Implements fallback mechanisms to handle provider failures.
* **Output:** Returns AI-generated text to the Document Generation Engine.

**3.4 Document Generation Engine Module:**

* **Input:** AI-generated text from the AI Provider Interface, PMBOK document templates.
* **Processing:**  Populates templates with AI-generated text, performs schema validation, and formats the output.
* **Output:** Passes the formatted document to the Output Module.

**3.5 Output Module:**

* **Input:** Formatted PMBOK documents from the Document Generation Engine.
* **Processing:**  Writes the documents to the specified output location (file system, database, etc.) in validated JSON format.
* **Output:** Confirmation of successful document generation.

**4. Interface Specifications**

[Insert Interface Specification Tables - These tables should detail the input and output parameters for each module interface.  Example for the Context Manager - AI Provider Interface interaction:]

| Method | Description                                      | Input Parameters                               | Output Parameters                     | Error Handling                               |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `getAIResponse` | Requests AI-generated text from a provider | `context: ProjectContext`, `provider: string` | `text: string`, `metadata: object`       | Throws custom exceptions for specific errors |


**5. Data Structures**

* **ProjectContext:**  A JSON object containing all relevant project information (e.g., project name, description, stakeholders, requirements).  Schema to be defined separately.
* **DocumentTemplate:** A JSON object defining the structure and content of a PMBOK document.  Schema to be defined separately.
* **AIProviderResponse:** A JSON object containing the AI-generated text and any relevant metadata.  Schema to be defined separately.

**6. Processing Logic**

The system follows a sequential process:

1. CLI receives user input.
2. CLI validates input and passes it to the Context Manager.
3. Context Manager stores and manages the context.
4. AI Provider Interface selects a provider and retrieves AI-generated text.
5. Document Generation Engine processes the text and templates.
6. Output Module writes the generated documents.

**7. Error Handling**

The system uses a combination of exception handling and logging to manage errors.  Custom exception types will be defined for specific error conditions (e.g., invalid input, API errors, template errors).  Detailed error messages will be logged for debugging purposes.  User-friendly error messages will be displayed to the user via the CLI.

**8. Performance Requirements**

* Document generation time should be less than [Time Limit] for projects of average complexity.
* The system should be able to handle concurrent requests from multiple users.
* Response times for API calls should be within [Time Limit].

**9. System Constraints**

* The system must be compatible with Node.js v16 or higher.
* The system must be able to run on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* The system must adhere to the specified PMBOK standards for document formats.

**10. Dependencies**

The dependencies are listed in the `PROJECT METADATA` section of the provided context.  These dependencies will be managed using npm or yarn.


**11. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v2.2.0):**

* Enhanced security features (authentication, authorization, audit logging)
* Integration with enterprise-level project management tools (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps)
* Support for additional document types beyond PMBOK standards.
* Improved UI/UX beyond the CLI for broader user accessibility.


This design specification provides a high-level overview of the Requirements Gathering Agent system.  More detailed design documents will be created for each module as the project progresses.
