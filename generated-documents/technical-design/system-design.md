## System Design Specification: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Authors:** Bard (AI System Design Architect)


**1. Introduction**

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary enterprise-grade API designed to automate the generation of BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  This document details the system's purpose, architecture, modules, interfaces, data structures, processing logic, error handling, performance requirements, constraints, and dependencies.  It aims to provide a comprehensive blueprint for developers and stakeholders.

**2. System Purpose and Scope**

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent aims to drastically reduce the time and effort required for generating comprehensive business analysis documentation.  It accepts input data describing a project or organization, processes this data using AI models and pre-defined templates, and outputs BABOK v3 compliant documents in various formats (currently focusing on Markdown for ease of initial implementation, with future expansion to PDF, DOCX, and HTML).  The system's scope includes:

* **Requirements Elicitation:**  Generating a structured representation of project requirements based on input data.
* **Stakeholder Analysis:**  Mapping and analyzing stakeholder relationships and influence.
* **Regulatory Compliance Integration:** Automatically incorporating relevant regulatory frameworks (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* **Multi-Format Output:** Generating documents in multiple formats.
* **API-First Design:** Providing a well-documented RESTful API for seamless integration with other systems.

**3. System Architecture**

The system employs a microservices-ready architecture, currently implemented as a monolithic application for initial development.  Future scalability will be achieved through modular design and separation of concerns.  The key components are:

* **API Gateway:**  Handles incoming requests, authentication, authorization, and routing. (Express.js)
* **Request Processor:**  Validates input data, manages job queues, and orchestrates the generation process. (TypeScript)
* **Document Generator:**  Utilizes AI models and templates to generate documents.  (TypeScript, potentially leveraging OpenAI, Google AI, etc., through a well-defined abstraction layer)
* **Template Manager:**  Stores, manages, and retrieves document templates. (Database - initially in-memory, later a persistent solution like MongoDB or PostgreSQL)
* **Output Manager:**  Formats and delivers the generated documents. (TypeScript)
* **Logging & Monitoring:**  Provides comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities for debugging and performance analysis. (Winston)

**4. Module Descriptions**

* **API Gateway (Express.js):**  This module handles all incoming HTTP requests, performs authentication (API key, JWT - future), authorization, rate limiting, and routes requests to the appropriate internal modules. It also handles error responses and provides a health check endpoint.

* **Request Processor (TypeScript):** This module validates incoming JSON requests using Zod schemas, enqueues jobs for processing, and manages job status. It interacts with the database to store and retrieve job information.

* **Document Generator (TypeScript):** This module is the core of the system. It uses the selected AI model (configurable) and the appropriate template to generate the document.  It leverages a well-defined abstraction layer to interact with different AI providers.

* **Template Manager (TypeScript + Database):** This module manages the storage and retrieval of document templates.  Initially, templates will be hardcoded, but the design allows for future database integration for flexible template management.

* **Output Manager (TypeScript):** This module handles the formatting and delivery of the generated documents.  Currently, it outputs Markdown; future development will support PDF, DOCX, and HTML.

**5. Interface Specifications**

The system exposes a RESTful API defined using OpenAPI 3.0.  Key endpoints include:

* `/api/v1/health`:  Health check endpoint.
* `/api/v1/documents/convert`:  POST endpoint for generating documents.  Accepts a JSON payload containing input data and template ID.
* `/api/v1/documents/jobs`:  GET endpoint for retrieving a list of processing jobs.
* `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`:  GET endpoint for checking the status of a specific job.
* `/api/v1/templates`:  GET and POST endpoints for managing templates (future enhancement).

[Detailed OpenAPI specification would be included here.]

**6. Data Structures**

* **Input Data (JSON):**  A JSON schema will define the structure of the input data.  This will include project details, stakeholder information, and any relevant regulatory requirements.

* **Template Data (JSON):**  Templates will be stored as JSON objects defining the structure and content of the generated documents.

* **Job Data (Database):**  Job data will be stored in a database, including job ID, status, input data, output location, and timestamps.


**7. Processing Logic**

1. The API Gateway receives a request to generate a document.
2. The Request Processor validates the input data and enqueues a job.
3. The Document Generator retrieves the appropriate template and uses an AI model to generate the document content.
4. The Output Manager formats the document and stores it.
5. The Request Processor updates the job status.
6. The API Gateway returns the job ID to the client.
7. The client can periodically poll the job status endpoint to check for completion.

**8. Error Handling**

The system incorporates comprehensive error handling at all levels.  Errors are logged, and appropriate HTTP status codes are returned to the client.  Error messages are informative and provide guidance on resolving issues.

**9. Performance Requirements**

The system should generate documents within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 2 seconds for typical enterprise scenarios).  Scalability is a key requirement, and the system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent requests.

**10. System Constraints**

* **AI Model Availability:**  The system's performance depends on the availability and responsiveness of the chosen AI models.
* **Input Data Quality:**  The quality of the generated documents depends on the quality and completeness of the input data.
* **Template Design:**  Well-designed templates are crucial for generating high-quality documents.

**11. Dependencies**

* Express.js
* TypeScript
* Zod
* Winston
* Chosen AI model libraries (e.g., OpenAI API client)
* Database (MongoDB or PostgreSQL - future)


**12. Future Enhancements**

* Expand output formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* Implement more sophisticated template management.
* Integrate with other project management tools.
* Improve AI model selection and management.
* Implement advanced security features (e.g., role-based access control).


This specification provides a high-level overview.  More detailed design documents for individual modules will be created as the project progresses.
