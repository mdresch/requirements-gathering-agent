## System Design Specification: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the system design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a tool that leverages AI to generate project management documentation based on PMBOK standards.  ADPA distinguishes itself through its comprehensive project analysis capabilities, intelligent context management, and support for multiple AI providers.  This design focuses on the core functionality, modular architecture, and key interfaces.

**2. System Purpose and Scope**

ADPA automates the creation of project management documentation, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency. It analyzes various project artifacts (README files, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.) to build a rich context for generating documents.  The system supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and offers a command-line interface for user interaction.  The primary output is a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant documents in Markdown format, with options for JSON and YAML.  A new feature includes a Technical Design Document Generation system.

**3. System Architecture**

ADPA employs a modular, microservice-like architecture, promoting maintainability and extensibility.  The system comprises several key modules:

* **Project Analyzer:** This module is responsible for discovering and analyzing project documents. It employs heuristics based on file names, locations, and content to determine relevance and assign scores.  This module outputs a structured representation of the project context, including a weighted list of relevant files and their categorization.

* **Context Manager:** This core module manages the project context, intelligently selecting and combining relevant information from the Project Analyzer's output.  It employs a multi-phase strategy to optimize context size for different AI models, balancing completeness with token limits.  The Context Manager interacts with the LLM Processor.

* **LLM Processor:** This module handles interactions with the selected AI provider.  It receives the context from the Context Manager and uses appropriate prompts to generate the requested documents.  It includes mechanisms for handling errors, retries, and fallback strategies. This module interacts with the Document Generator.

* **Document Generator:** This module uses predefined templates to structure the output from the LLM Processor. It ensures adherence to PMBOK standards and desired output formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML).  It also interacts with the Version Control System.

* **Version Control System (VCS):**  A local Git repository within the `generated-documents` directory automatically tracks changes to generated documents.  This allows users to review history, compare versions, and revert to previous states using CLI commands.

* **CLI Interface:** This module provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.  It handles user input, configuration, and manages the overall workflow.

**4. Module Descriptions**

* **Project Analyzer:**  Uses `glob` to discover files, natural language processing (NLP) to assess relevance, and assigns scores based on predefined rules.  Languages: TypeScript, Node.js.  Dependencies: `glob`, NLP library (e.g., spaCy).

* **Context Manager:**  Implements the 3-phase context strategy, prioritizes relevant information, and handles token limits. Languages: TypeScript, Node.js.  Dependencies: None (internal).

* **LLM Processor:**  Abstracts away the specific AI provider.  Uses a factory pattern to select the correct provider based on configuration. Languages: TypeScript, Node.js.  Dependencies: `@azure/openai`, `@google/generative-ai`, `openai`, etc. (depending on selected provider).

* **Document Generator:**  Uses Handlebars or similar templating engine to populate templates with LLM output.  Includes validation against PMBOK standards. Languages: TypeScript, Node.js.  Dependencies: Templating engine, PMBOK validation library (custom or third-party).

* **VCS:** Uses Node.js bindings for Git. Languages: TypeScript, Node.js. Dependencies: Node.js Git library.

* **CLI Interface:**  Built using `commander.js` or similar.  Handles argument parsing, configuration loading, and workflow orchestration. Languages: TypeScript, Node.js. Dependencies: `commander.js`.


**5. Interface Specifications**

* **Project Analyzer to Context Manager:**  Structured JSON representing discovered documents, their relevance scores, and categories.

* **Context Manager to LLM Processor:**  JSON containing the selected context for the AI model, including the prompt.

* **LLM Processor to Document Generator:**  JSON containing the generated text from the AI model.

* **Document Generator to VCS:**  File paths of generated documents and version information.

* **CLI Interface to all modules:**  Command-line arguments and configuration settings.


**6. Data Structures**

* **Project Context:**  A JSON object containing:
    * `files`: Array of objects, each representing a discovered file (path, relevance score, category).
    * `context`:  String containing the combined context for the LLM.

* **AI Provider Response:**  JSON object specific to the AI provider, containing generated text and metadata.

* **Generated Document:**  JSON or Markdown object representing the final output.  Structure depends on the document type (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register).


**7. Processing Logic**

The system follows a sequential workflow:

1. CLI Interface receives user input and loads configuration.
2. Project Analyzer discovers and analyzes project documents.
3. Context Manager builds the context for the LLM.
4. LLM Processor generates the document using the selected AI provider.
5. Document Generator formats the output and performs validation.
6. VCS automatically commits the generated document.

**8. Error Handling**

* **AI Provider Errors:**  The LLM Processor includes retry mechanisms and fallback strategies for handling provider errors.
* **Validation Errors:**  The Document Generator reports validation errors to the user.
* **File System Errors:**  Appropriate error handling for file I/O operations.
* **Configuration Errors:**  Clear error messages for invalid configuration settings.


**9. Performance Requirements**

* **Context Analysis:**  Analysis of a typical project should complete within 5-10 seconds.
* **Document Generation:**  Generation of individual documents should take less than 30 seconds.
* **Scalability:**  The system should be able to handle projects with a large number of documents.


**10. System Constraints**

* **AI Provider Limits:**  The system is constrained by the token limits and processing capabilities of the selected AI provider.
* **Resource Constraints:**  The system's performance is affected by available CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.


**11. Dependencies**

* Node.js v18+
* Chosen AI provider APIs and SDKs
* Git (for VCS)
* Relevant NLP libraries (if used)
* Templating engine (e.g., Handlebars)


**12. Future Considerations**

* Integration with other project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* Support for additional document types and AI providers.
* Enhanced UI for easier interaction.
* Improved context management algorithms.


This document provides a high-level overview of the ADPA system design.  Further detailed design specifications for individual modules will be provided in separate documents.
