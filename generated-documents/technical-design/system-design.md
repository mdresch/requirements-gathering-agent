## System Design Specification: Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (ADPA)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (Simulated Senior Software Architect)


**1. Introduction**

The Advanced Document Processing & Automation Framework (ADPA) is a modular, standards-compliant enterprise automation framework designed for AI-powered document generation, project management, and business analysis.  This document specifies the system's architecture, modules, interfaces, and data structures.  It replaces the previous documentation for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA).

**2. System Overview**

ADPA aims to automate the creation of professional documentation adhering to industry standards such as BABOK v3, PMBOK 7th Edition, and DMBOK 2.0. It provides a CLI and a RESTful API, allowing interaction through various methods and integration with existing enterprise systems.  Key features include multi-provider AI support, intelligent context management, and integrations with Atlassian Confluence, Microsoft SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services.  The system is designed for scalability, security, and compliance with various regulatory standards (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX, FINRA, PCI DSS).

**3. System Architecture**

ADPA employs a microservices architecture, promoting scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of individual components. The system is broadly divided into the following core modules:

**3.1 Core Modules:**

* **AI Processing Engine:** This module orchestrates interactions with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).  It manages model selection, request routing, response processing, and fallback mechanisms for provider failures.  This module is crucial for intelligent context injection and processing.

* **Document Generator:** This module is responsible for generating documents based on chosen templates and provided data. It utilizes a template engine (e.g., Handlebars, Mustache) to render documents in various formats (Markdown, JSON, PDF).  It supports multiple frameworks (BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK).

* **REST API Server (Express.js):**  This module exposes a production-ready REST API defined using TypeSpec and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications. It handles authentication, authorization, request validation, and response formatting.  Swagger UI is integrated for API documentation.

* **CLI Interface (Yargs):** This module provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the system.  It offers commands for document generation, framework selection, integration management, and system configuration.

* **Integration Layer:** This module handles interactions with external systems like Confluence, SharePoint, and Adobe Document Services.  It manages authentication, data transfer, and error handling for each integration.  It will utilize respective APIs and SDKs.

* **Admin Interface (Next.js, React):** A web-based portal for managing system configurations, user accounts, AI providers, integrations, and monitoring system health.  It provides a user-friendly interface for managing ADPA.

* **Analytics & Reporting:** This module collects usage metrics, generates reports, and provides insights into system performance and user behavior.  It will utilize a suitable database (e.g.,  PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for data storage.

**3.2 Technology Stack:**

* **Backend:** Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5.7+, Express.js
* **AI Integration:** OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama
* **API:** TypeSpec, OpenAPI 3.0, Swagger UI
* **Frontend (Admin):** Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
* **Database:**  Initially JSON-based configuration; scalable to SQL/NoSQL for analytics and reporting.
* **Testing:** Jest, TypeScript, comprehensive unit and integration tests.


**4. Module Descriptions:**

**(Detailed descriptions of each module, including internal components, data flows, and dependencies, would be included here.  This section would be significantly expanded in a full specification.)**  Examples:

* **AI Processing Engine:**  Sub-modules for each AI provider (e.g., `OpenAIProcessor`, `GoogleAIProcessor`).  Data flow:  Request from Document Generator ->  Provider Selection -> AI Provider Interaction -> Response Processing -> Data back to Document Generator. Error Handling:  Retry mechanisms, fallback providers, detailed logging.

* **Document Generator:** Template management system, templating engine, output formatting logic (Markdown, JSON, PDF conversion using libraries like Puppeteer or PDFKit).  Data flow:  Template selection, data input, template rendering, output formatting.

* **REST API Server:**  Endpoint definitions for each function (generation, template listing, integration management).  Authentication middleware (using JWT or OAuth 2.0 with Entra ID), authorization middleware (RBAC), request validation using libraries like Joi or Zod.


**5. Interface Specifications:**

**(Detailed specifications of all APIs, CLI commands, and internal interfaces would be included here.  This would include request/response structures, error codes, and authentication/authorization mechanisms.)**

**Example - REST API Endpoint:**

`/api/v1/generate`

* **Method:** POST
* **Request:**
    * `framework`: (string, required)  BABOK, PMBOK, DMBOK
    * `documentType`: (string, required)  e.g., project-charter, stakeholder-analysis
    * `data`: (JSON, required)  Data required for document generation
    * `format`: (string, optional)  markdown, json, pdf
* **Response:**
    * `success`: (boolean)
    * `document`: (string or binary) Generated document
    * `errors`: (array) List of errors


**6. Data Structures:**

**(Detailed specifications of all data structures used within the system would be included here.  This would include database schemas, API request/response formats, and internal data representations.)**

**Example - Project Configuration:**

```json
{
  "projectName": "Example Project",
  "framework": "PMBOK",
  "aiProvider": "openai",
  "apiKey": "your-api-key",
  "integrations": {
    "confluence": {
      "enabled": true,
      "baseUrl": "your-confluence-url"
    },
    "sharepoint": {
      "enabled": false
    }
  }
}
```

**7. Processing Logic:**

**(Detailed descriptions of the processing logic for each module and function would be included here.  This would include algorithms, decision trees, and state machines.)**


**8. Error Handling:**

The system will implement comprehensive error handling at each layer.  Error codes will be standardized and documented.  Logging will be implemented for debugging and monitoring.  Retry mechanisms will be used where appropriate.

**9. Performance Requirements:**

**(Specific performance requirements, such as response times, throughput, and scalability targets, would be defined here.)**

**10. System Constraints:**

**(Any limitations or constraints on the system, such as resource limitations, platform restrictions, or external dependencies, would be documented here.)**

**11. Dependencies:**

**(A complete list of all external libraries, services, and APIs used by the system would be provided here.)**

**12. Security Considerations:**

ADPA will adhere to a zero-trust security model.  Key considerations include:

* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Secure authentication using Microsoft Entra ID and robust authorization using RBAC.
* **Data Protection:**  Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
* **Input Validation:**  Strict validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits:**  Conducting regular security assessments and penetration testing.
* **Compliance:**  Adherence to relevant regulatory standards (GDPR, SOX, PCI DSS, etc.).

**13. Deployment:**

The system will support deployment via Docker containers and Kubernetes for scalability and ease of deployment.


This System Design Specification provides a high-level overview.  A complete specification would include significantly more detail in each section.  This document serves as a starting point for development and ongoing refinement.
