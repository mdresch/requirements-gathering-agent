# Adobe.io Integration Setup Instructions

## Quick Start: Get Your Adobe PDF Conversion Working in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Get Your Adobe.io Credentials (2 minutes)

1. **Go to Adobe Developer Console**: https://developer.adobe.com/console
2. **Sign in** with your Adobe ID
3. **Find your existing project** or create a new one
4. **Copy these 2 values:**
   - **Client ID** (looks like: `1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef`)
   - **Client Secret** (looks like: `p8e-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz`)

### Step 2: Add Your Credentials to the Code (1 minute)

1. **Open**: `ADPA/src/commands/word.ts`
2. **Find lines around 1330** that look like:
   ```typescript
   const ADOBE_CLIENT_ID = 'your-adobe-client-id-here';
   const ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your-adobe-client-secret-here';
   ```
3. **Replace** with your actual credentials:
   ```typescript
   const ADOBE_CLIENT_ID = '1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef';
   const ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET = 'p8e-AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz';
   ```

### Step 3: Test Your Integration (2 minutes)

1. **Build and run** your ADPA add-in:
   ```bash
   cd ADPA
   npm run dev-server
   ```

2. **Open Microsoft Word**

3. **Load your add-in** (sideload if needed)

4. **Look for the "Adobe PDF" button** in the ribbon

5. **Click "Adobe PDF"** to convert your document!

## What You'll See

‚úÖ **Success**: Document converts to professional PDF with ADPA branding  
‚úÖ **Download link**: Appears in your document  
‚úÖ **Professional formatting**: Corporate colors and styling applied  

## Troubleshooting

### "Adobe authentication failed"
- Double-check your Client ID and Client Secret
- Make sure you copied them exactly (no extra spaces)
- Verify your Adobe Developer Console project is active

### "Adobe upload failed" 
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your Adobe.io account has PDF Services enabled
- Try again in a few minutes (temporary service issue)

### "PDF generation timed out"
- Large documents take longer to process
- Try with a smaller document first
- Check Adobe.io service status

## Next Steps After It Works

1. **Test with real documents** from your `generated-documents` folder
2. **Customize the HTML styling** in the `markdownToHTML()` function
3. **Add more Adobe services** (InDesign, Illustrator, Sign)
4. **Improve error handling** and user feedback
5. **Add batch processing** for multiple documents

## Security Note

‚ö†Ô∏è **For Development Only**: This implementation puts credentials directly in the client-side code, which is fine for development and testing.

üîí **For Production**: Move Adobe API calls to a server endpoint to keep credentials secure.
