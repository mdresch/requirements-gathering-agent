# Work Performance Information: Scope Performance vs. Scope Baseline

## Purpose
This document summarizes how the project scope is performing relative to the approved scope baseline, providing actionable insights for project managers and stakeholders.

## What is Work Performance Information (WPI)?
Work Performance Information (WPI) is the processed, analyzed, and integrated data on project performance. For scope, WPI highlights variances, trends, and status of deliverables compared to the scope baseline.

## Inputs
- Scope Baseline (Project Scope Statement, WBS, WBS Dictionary)
- Requirements Documentation
- Change Requests and Change Log
- Status Reports and Deliverable Reviews
- Validated Deliverables

## Key Metrics and Analysis
- **Scope Variance:** Comparison of completed deliverables to planned deliverables in the WBS.
- **Change Requests:** Number and impact of approved/rejected scope changes.
- **Requirements Traceability:** Percentage of requirements fully delivered and accepted.
- **Scope Creep:** Identification of any unapproved work or deliverables.
- **Acceptance Status:** List of deliverables formally accepted vs. pending.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** For any variances or issues.

## Reporting and Communication
- Regular status updates to stakeholders on scope performance.
- Highlighting any trends, risks, or corrective actions needed.
- Integration with overall project performance reporting.

## Outputs
- Work Performance Information (WPI) on scope for use in Control Scope, Validate Scope, and overall project reporting.
- Recommendations for corrective or preventive actions if variances are detected.

**Summary:**
Work Performance Information for scope provides a clear, data-driven view of how the project is progressing against the scope baseline, enabling proactive management and informed decision-making.
