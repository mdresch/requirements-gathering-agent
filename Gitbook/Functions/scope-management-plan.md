# Scope Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Management Plan defines how the scope of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and verified. The project aims to deliver an AI-powered requirements gathering and PMBOK documentation generator tool supporting multiple AI providers for enterprise-grade project management automation.

The scope management plan aligns with the PMBOK® Guide (7th Edition) best practices to ensure all project requirements are captured and the project deliverables meet stakeholder expectations.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Project Purpose and Justification

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project is initiated to automate the collection and analysis of project requirements and generate comprehensive PMBOK-aligned project management documentation. This tool will enhance enterprise project management by offering flexibility through multi-provider AI integration, including Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI models, Ollama local AI, and Azure AI Studio.

### 2.2 Project Deliverables

- AI-powered requirements gathering module
- Strategic planning documents (vision, mission, core values, purpose)
- PMBOK-aligned documentation including:
  - Project Charter
  - Stakeholder Register
  - Scope Management Plan
  - Requirements Management Plan
  - Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder Engagement Plans
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary
  - Activity List, Duration, and Resource Estimates
  - Schedule Network Diagram and Milestone List
- Multi-provider AI support with automatic fallback
- Command-line interface for document generation
- Modular architecture suitable for integration with any Node.js/TypeScript project
- Documentation generation scripts and API functions

### 2.3 Project Boundaries

**In Scope:**

- Development of AI integrations for the specified providers
- Implementation of PMBOK process group document generation
- CLI tool and API for project documentation generation
- Support for enterprise security (Azure Entra ID)
- Local AI support for offline usage

**Out of Scope:**

- Development of a full project management software (only documentation generation)
- AI model training or customization beyond provider configurations
- Hosting or managing AI infrastructure (beyond integration)
- Non-PMBOK documentation

### 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

- All PMBOK documents can be generated automatically based on provided inputs
- Support for all four AI providers with automatic fallback on failure
- Strict JSON or Markdown output formats for easy integration
- Documentation and examples available for installation, configuration, and usage
- Security features enabled for enterprise deployments (e.g., Entra ID authentication)
- CLI and programmatic access are functional and well-documented

## 3. Scope Management Approach

### 3.1 Scope Definition Process

- Requirements will be gathered from stakeholders through workshops, interviews, and analysis of enterprise project management needs.
- AI-powered generation capabilities will be designed and implemented iteratively.
- Project scope will be documented formally in the Project Charter and Scope Statement.
- Any scope changes will be managed through a formal change control process.

### 3.2 Scope Verification

- Deliverables will be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor and key stakeholders.
- Automated tests and user acceptance tests (UAT) will verify the scope completeness and correctness.
- Acceptance will be based on meeting the functional requirements and the acceptance criteria.

### 3.3 Scope Control

- A Change Control Board (CCB) or equivalent authority will review and approve/decline any change requests.
- Impact analysis (on schedule, cost, quality) will be performed for all proposed changes.
- Scope baseline will be updated only after approved changes.
- Continuous monitoring via status meetings and progress reports.

## 6. Scope Change Management

### 6.1 Change Request Process

- Stakeholders submit formal change requests describing the proposed change.
- Project Manager logs and assesses the change for impact.
- Change Control Board reviews the request and decides approval or rejection.
- Approved changes are incorporated into the project scope baseline.
- All changes and decisions are documented and communicated.

### 6.2 Tools and Techniques

- Use of issue tracking and change management software (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps)
- Impact analysis templates
- Regular scope review meetings

---

## 7. Scope Monitoring and Reporting

- Weekly status reports will monitor scope progress and any deviations.
- Scope verification checkpoints at the end of each major deliverable.
- Use of traceability matrices to ensure all requirements are addressed.
- Stakeholder review sessions to validate scope deliverables.

---

## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

### 8.1 Assumptions

- AI providers’ APIs will remain stable during development.
- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback.
- Project team has required skills for AI integration and PMBOK documentation.

### 8.2 Constraints
