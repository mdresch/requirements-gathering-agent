# Validate Scope Process

## Purpose
The Validate Scope process is a formal procedure in PMBOK for obtaining stakeholder acceptance of completed project deliverables. It ensures that deliverables meet the documented requirements and acceptance criteria, and that only work that has been formally accepted is considered complete.

## Inputs
- **Project Management Plan** (especially the Scope Management Plan)
- **Requirements Documentation**
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix**
- **Verified Deliverables** (checked for quality)
- **Work Performance Data**

## Key Activities
1. Review completed deliverables with stakeholders.
2. Compare deliverables against requirements and acceptance criteria.
3. Obtain formal sign-off or acceptance from the customer or sponsor.
4. Document any change requests or discrepancies.
5. Update project documents with acceptance status.

## Outputs
- **Accepted Deliverables**
- **Change Requests** (if deliverables are not accepted)
- **Work Performance Information**
- **Updates to project documents** (e.g., lessons learned, requirements documentation)

## Integration
Validate Scope is closely linked with Control Quality (which checks correctness) and Control Scope (which manages changes to the scope baseline).

## Best Practices
- Engage stakeholders early and often.
- Use clear acceptance criteria.
- Maintain traceability from requirements to deliverables.
- Document all acceptance decisions.

**Summary:**
Validate Scope is the formal process of gaining stakeholder acceptance for project deliverables, ensuring alignment with requirements, and updating project records accordingly.
