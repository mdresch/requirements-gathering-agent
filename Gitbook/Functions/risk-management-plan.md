# Risk Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Risk Management Plan establishes the framework and approach for identifying, analyzing, monitoring, and controlling risks throughout the lifecycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. The goal is to proactively manage potential threats and opportunities to maximize project success.

---

## 2. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent  
**Project Description:**  
An AI-powered requirements gathering and PMBOK documentation generator supporting multiple AI providers for enterprise-grade project management automation.

**Project Objectives:**  
- Deliver a versatile tool supporting Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama, and Azure AI Studio providers  
- Automate generation of PMBOK-aligned project management documentation  
- Ensure flexibility, security, and reliability for enterprise and offline development use cases

---

## 3. Risk Management Approach

The project will follow a structured risk management process aligned to PMBOK guidelines:

- **Risk Identification:** Systematic identification of internal and external risks  
- **Risk Analysis:** Qualitative and quantitative assessment of risk impact and probability  
- **Risk Prioritization:** Ranking risks based on their severity and likelihood  
- **Risk Response Planning:** Developing mitigation, avoidance, transfer, or acceptance strategies  
- **Risk Monitoring and Control:** Ongoing tracking, reassessment, and reporting of risks

The Risk Manager, supported by the project team, will lead risk management activities with involvement from stakeholders as necessary.

## 7. Risk Analysis and Prioritization

### Qualitative Analysis

Each risk is assessed based on:

- **Likelihood:** Probability of occurrence (Low, Medium, High)  
- **Impact:** Effect on project objectives if risk occurs (Low, Medium, High)  
- **Priority:** Risk exposure = Likelihood Ã— Impact

### Quantitative Analysis

If necessary, for high-priority risks, further quantitative analysis (e.g., Monte Carlo simulation, expected monetary value) will be performed to evaluate financial impact and schedule delays.
