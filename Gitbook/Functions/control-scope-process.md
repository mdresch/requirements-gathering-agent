# Control Scope Process

## Purpose
The Control Scope process ensures that all changes to the project scope are properly managed, preventing scope creep and ensuring that only approved changes are implemented. It maintains alignment between the project deliverables and the scope baseline throughout the project lifecycle.

## Inputs
- **Project Management Plan** (especially the Scope Management Plan)
- **Scope Baseline**
- **Requirements Documentation**
- **Work Performance Data**
- **Change Requests**

## Key Activities
1. Monitor project work and deliverables against the approved scope baseline.
2. Identify and document any deviations or variances from the scope.
3. Evaluate change requests related to scope, including impact analysis on schedule, cost, quality, and risk.
4. Submit change requests for review and approval by the Change Control Board (CCB) or designated authority.
5. Update the scope baseline and related documents upon approval of changes.
6. Communicate scope changes and their impacts to all stakeholders.
7. Maintain updated Requirements Traceability Matrix and WBS.
8. Document lessons learned and update organizational process assets.

## Outputs
- **Work Performance Information** (scope status, variances, corrective actions)
- **Change Requests** (approved or rejected)
- **Updates to Project Documents** (scope baseline, requirements documentation, WBS, RTM)

## Integration
Control Scope is closely linked with Validate Scope (formal acceptance of deliverables), Perform Integrated Change Control (overall change management), and Control Quality (ensuring deliverables meet requirements).

## Best Practices
- Use a formal change control process for all scope changes.
- Engage stakeholders in scope reviews and change assessments.
- Maintain clear documentation and traceability for all changes.
- Regularly review scope status and communicate updates.

**Summary:**
Control Scope is the process of monitoring, managing, and controlling changes to the project scope, ensuring that only approved changes are implemented and that the project remains aligned with its objectives and baseline.
