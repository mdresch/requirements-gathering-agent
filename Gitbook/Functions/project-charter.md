# Project Charter

## 1. Project Title
Requirements Gathering Agent — AI-Powered Requirements Gathering and PMBOK Documentation Generator

## 2. Project Purpose / Business Need
The Requirements Gathering Agent is designed to automate and streamline enterprise-grade project management documentation by leveraging AI technologies from multiple providers. It addresses the need for comprehensive, consistent, and PMBOK-aligned documentation generation, reducing manual effort, improving accuracy, and increasing project success rates.

## 3. Project Description / Scope
This project involves the design, development, and deployment of an AI-powered software tool that supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI with Entra ID, GitHub AI Models, Ollama local AI, and Azure AI Studio) to generate strategic planning documents, requirements analyses, and PMBOK-compliant project management artifacts. The solution includes:

- Strategic planning modules producing vision, mission, core values, and purpose statements;
- Comprehensive requirements gathering with user roles and needs identification;
- Automatic generation of PMBOK Process Group documents including Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Schedule Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, and others;
- Support for detailed project artifacts like WBS, activity lists, milestone lists;
- Modular architecture with strict JSON output for integration flexibility;
- CLI and programmatic interfaces for document generation;
- Multi-provider AI support with automatic fallback for reliability.

Out of scope: Manual document editing, non-PMBOK standards, AI model training.

## 4. Project Objectives
- Deliver a fully functional Requirements Gathering Agent supporting 4 AI providers with seamless switching.
- Generate PMBOK-compliant project management documents automatically based on minimal user input.
- Achieve ≥95% accuracy and completeness in generated documents per PMBOK standards.
- Provide CLI and API interfaces for easy integration into enterprise workflows.
- Ensure enterprise-grade security by supporting Azure Entra ID authentication.
- Support offline AI usage via Ollama for local development environments.
- Publish the tool as an npm package for wide adoption.
- Provide comprehensive documentation and sample projects for quick adoption.

## 5. Success Criteria / Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Completion of core AI integration with each provider within project timeline.
- Successful generation of all PMBOK Initiating and Planning Process Group documents.
- Positive feedback from pilot users with ≥90% satisfaction on document quality.
- Automated test coverage ≥80% for core modules.
- Documentation generation time <30 seconds per document on average.
- Seamless environment configuration and provider switching demonstrated.
- Published npm package with 100+ downloads within first 3 months post-release.
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities reported post-launch.

## 6. High-Level Requirements
- Support for AI providers: Azure OpenAI (with API Key and Entra ID), GitHub AI Models, Ollama local AI, Azure AI Studio.
- Environment configuration via `.env` file supporting multiple profiles.
- Modular TypeScript codebase with ES module imports.
- Strict JSON output format for all AI-generated documents.
- CLI commands for generating all PMBOK documents at once.
- Support for large token LLM models for long document generation.
- Support for technical analysis, risk analysis, compliance, and UI/UX considerations.
- Integration-ready APIs for strategic planning, requirements gathering, and PMBOK document generation.
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms between AI providers.
- User guides, troubleshooting documentation, and sample scripts.
