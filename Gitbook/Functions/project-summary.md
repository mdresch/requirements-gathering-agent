# Project Summary: Requirements Gathering Agent

## Overview
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is an AI-powered software solution designed to automate and streamline enterprise-grade project management documentation and requirements gathering processes. Leveraging multi-provider AI support, it generates comprehensive, PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)-aligned documentation covering all essential project management phases—from initiation through detailed planning—thus enabling organizations to accelerate project setup, improve documentation quality, and ensure compliance with industry standards.

This tool supports various AI providers including Azure OpenAI (with enterprise-grade Entra ID authentication), GitHub AI Models, Ollama (local/offline AI), and Azure AI Studio, offering maximum flexibility, reliability, and security for diverse enterprise environments.
