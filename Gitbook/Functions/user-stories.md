Here are detailed user stories with acceptance criteria based on the Requirements Gathering Agent project context:

---

### User Story 1: Multi-Provider AI Support Configuration

**As a** project manager,  
**I want** to configure and switch between multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI with Entra ID, Azure OpenAI with API key, GitHub AI models, Ollama local AI)  
**so that** I can ensure maximum flexibility, reliability, and security for AI-powered project documentation generation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given I have valid credentials for an AI provider, when I update the `.env` file with the provider's configuration, then the system uses that provider for all AI operations.  
- Given I have multiple provider configurations, when one provider fails, then the system automatically falls back to the next configured provider.  
- Given I want to use Azure OpenAI with Entra ID, when I set `USE_ENTRA_ID=true` and provide endpoint info, then authentication occurs via Entra ID.  
- Given I want local offline development, when I configure Ollama endpoint, then AI requests route to local Ollama service.  
- The system must validate provider configurations at startup and display meaningful errors if misconfigured.

### User Story 2: Generate Strategic Planning Documents

**As a** business analyst,  
**I want** to generate strategic planning documents including project vision, mission, core values, and purpose statements  
**so that** I can establish a clear strategic foundation for the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given I provide business problem, technology stack, and context, when I call `generateStrategicSections()`, then the system returns vision, mission, core values, and purpose statements.  
- The returned documents must be coherent, relevant to the input business problem, and aligned with enterprise goals.  
- The output should be in JSON or structured format for easy consumption.

### User Story 3: Generate Comprehensive User Requirements

**As a** requirements engineer,  
**I want** to generate detailed user roles, needs, and processes  
**so that** I can capture all essential user requirements for the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given business problem, technology stack, and context, when I call `generateRequirements()`, then I receive a list of user roles each with associated needs and processes.  
- Each role must be clearly defined, with needs that map to business objectives.  
- The output must be structured to facilitate traceability in later documents.

### User Story 4: Generate PMBOK-Aligned Project Charter

**As a** project manager,  
**I want** to generate a complete project charter document aligned with PMBOK initiating process group  
**so that** I can formally authorize the project and outline high-level objectives.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given project context inputs, when I call `getAiProjectCharter()`, then I receive a well-structured project charter including project purpose, objectives, stakeholders, and authorization.  
- The document must follow PMBOK standards for initiating process group documentation.  
- The output must be in markdown or text format suitable for immediate use or modification.

### User Story 5: Generate Comprehensive PMBOK Management Plans

**As a** project planner,  
**I want** to generate all key PMBOK management plans (Scope, Requirements, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, Stakeholder Engagement)  
**so that** I can have a complete, consistent, and standards-aligned project plan.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given project context, when I call each respective management plan function (e.g., `getAiScopeManagementPlan()`), then I receive a detailed management plan document aligned with PMBOK guidelines.  
- Each plan should address the specific knowledge area and describe relevant approaches, processes, and controls.  
- The system should allow generating plans independently or as a batch.  
- Output documents must be in standardized formats for easy integration.

### User Story 6: Generate Detailed Planning Artifacts

**As a** project scheduler,  
**I want** to generate detailed planning artifacts such as WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Duration Estimates, Resource Estimates, Schedule Network Diagram, and Milestone List  
**so that** I can effectively plan and track project activities.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given project context, when I call the corresponding artifact generation functions, then I receive detailed and properly formatted artifacts consistent with PMBOK best practices.  
- The WBS must be hierarchical and decomposed logically.  
- Activity lists must include dependencies and resource estimations.  
- Milestones must highlight key deliverables and checkpoints.  
- Artifacts should be exportable in markdown or JSON formats.

### User Story 7: Generate Additional Analyses and Considerations

**As a** technical architect or compliance officer,  
**I want** to generate technology stack analysis, risk analysis, compliance considerations, and UI/UX guidelines  
**so that** I can ensure technical feasibility, risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, and optimal user experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given project context, when I call analysis functions (`getAiTechStackAnalysis()`, `getAiRiskAnalysis()`, etc.), then I receive comprehensive reports addressing each area.  
- Technology analysis should recommend architectures and tools aligned with project needs.  
- Risk analysis must identify, assess, and propose mitigation strategies.  
- Compliance considerations must highlight applicable regulations and standards.  
- UI/UX guidelines must include best practices tailored to the project context.

### User Story 8: Command-Line Interface for Documentation Generation

**As a** developer or project manager,  
**I want** to generate all project documentation from a command-line interface  
**so that** I can automate and integrate documentation generation into my CI/CD or project workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Given proper AI provider configuration, when I run commands like `npm run generate-docs` or `node dist/cli.js`, then the system generates all PMBOK and strategic documents.  
- The CLI must provide feedback on generation status and error reporting.  
- Output files must be saved in organized directories with meaningful filenames.  
- The CLI should support development mode with auto-compilation (`npm run dev`).

### User Story 9: Integration Capability for Node.js/TypeScript Projects

**As a** developer,  
**I want** to easily integrate the requirements gathering agent into my Node.js or TypeScript project  
**so that** I can automate project documentation generation without complex setup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The package can be installed via `npm install requirements-gathering-agent`.  
- Functions can be imported and used with typed interfaces.  
- The agent supports ES modules and works with Node.js 18+.  
- Documentation and example scripts are provided for quick onboarding.
