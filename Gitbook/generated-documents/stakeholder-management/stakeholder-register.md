## Document Purpose

This document serves as the foundation for stakeholder engagement planning and communication strategy.  It is pre-populated based on analysis of available project documentation, but requires completion of organizational details.

## 1. Stakeholder Identification Summary

**Primary Stakeholders (High Power, High Interest):**  Based on the project's README and its focus on serving project managers and business analysts, the primary stakeholders are:

* **Project Managers:** Individuals responsible for planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing projects.  High interest due to direct benefit from ADPA's capabilities (automation, PMBOK compliance). High power due to their project decision-making authority.
* **Business Analysts:** Individuals responsible for eliciting, analyzing, and documenting business requirements. High interest due to direct benefit from ADPA's capabilities (requirements gathering, documentation). Moderate power depending on their role within the organization.


**Secondary Stakeholders (Variable Power/Interest):**  These stakeholders will have varying levels of power and interest depending on their specific roles and involvement with the project.

* **Software Developers:**  Their interest is moderate as ADPA indirectly impacts their workflow through improved project documentation. Their power is moderate, depending on their seniority and influence on project decisions.
* **IT Operations/Infrastructure:**  Low interest and low power unless ADPA requires specific infrastructure support.
* **Legal/Compliance:** Low interest and low power unless specific legal or compliance concerns arise related to data usage or intellectual property.
* **Executive Management:** High power, low interest initially, but their interest will increase if ADPA delivers significant ROI or addresses critical business needs.
