## 1. Stakeholder Identification Summary

The following stakeholders have been identified based on analysis of the project README, inferring roles and influence from the described functionality and target audience:

**High Power, High Interest:**

* **Project Sponsor:**  (To be determined - requires organizational input.  Likely a VP of Engineering or similar role given the technical nature of the project)
* **Product Owner:** (To be determined - requires organizational input. Responsible for defining and prioritizing features)
* **Development Team Lead:** (To be determined - requires organizational input.  Manages the development team)


**High Power, Low Interest:**

* **Executive Steering Committee:** (To be determined - requires organizational input.  Provides high-level oversight and approval)
* **Legal/Compliance Officer:** (To be determined - requires organizational input.  Reviews for compliance issues)


**Low Power, High Interest:**

* **Business Analysts:** (To be determined - requires organizational input.  Provide input into requirements and use cases)
* **Project Managers (external users):**  (This is the primary target audience based on the README's marketing).  High interest due to the tool's benefit to their workflow.
* **Software Developers (external users):** (Secondary target audience, high interest due to potential for improved technical documentation)


**Low Power, Low Interest:**

* **General Public:** (Awareness of the tool's existence via NPM). Low power and interest, but their downloads are a key metric.
