## Stakeholder Classification

Stakeholders are classified based on their level of influence and interest using a power/interest grid.

**High Influence/High Interest:**  These stakeholders require active engagement and close monitoring.  (Sarah Thompson, David Lee, Menno Drescher, Azure OpenAI Team)

**High Influence/Low Interest:**  These stakeholders require regular monitoring and communication to maintain their support. (None identified in this project.)

**Low Influence/High Interest:** These stakeholders require regular communication to keep them informed and address their concerns. (Michael Rivera, John Smith)

**Low Influence/Low Interest:**  These stakeholders require minimal engagement. (None explicitly identified, but could include general users of the tool in the future)


## Power/Interest Grid

This grid visualizes the power and interest levels of each stakeholder.

```
                High Interest                Low Interest
High Power       | STK-001, STK-003, STK-006, STK-007 |
-----------------|------------------------------------|
Low Power        | STK-002, STK-004, STK-005          |
```

## Engagement Level

The current and desired engagement levels are based on the stakeholder's role and influence.  Active engagement involves regular communication and collaboration, while passive engagement involves monitoring and occasional communication.


## Communication Plan

The communication plan outlines the preferred methods and frequency of communication for each stakeholder.  This plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project.


This Stakeholder Register will be regularly updated to reflect changes in stakeholder involvement, needs, and the overall project context.  This ensures that stakeholder management remains a key focus of the project's success.
