### 2. Stakeholder Assessment

**2.1 Power/Interest Grid:**

| Power     | High Interest | Medium Interest | Low Interest |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **High**  | Menno Drescher (Sponsor), End-Users | Development Team | Azure OpenAI (if integration issues) |
| **Medium**| Project Management | Google/GitHub/Ollama AI  | NPM             |
| **Low**   |  -              | -                | -            |


**2.2 Influence/Impact Matrix:** (Similar to Power/Interest, but can focus on specific project aspects)

This would require a more detailed analysis of each stakeholder's influence on specific project deliverables (e.g.,  Menno's influence on project scope, End-Users' influence on feature prioritization).  This matrix would be a large table, so is omitted for brevity in this example.  It would be included in a real-world document.


**2.3 Stakeholder Attitudes & Engagement Levels:**

| Stakeholder         | Attitude           | Engagement Level | Notes                                  |
|----------------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Menno Drescher       | Supportive         | High              | Primary driver, actively involved        |
| Development Team     | Supportive         | High              | Directly involved in development          |
| Project Management   | Supportive         | Medium            | Monitoring and reporting                  |
| End-Users            | Neutral to Supportive| Medium to Low     | Engagement depends on marketing & usability|
| Azure OpenAI          | Neutral            | Low               | Primarily a service provider             |
| Other AI Providers   | Neutral            | Low               | Primarily alternative service providers   |
| NPM                  | Neutral            | Low               | Distribution platform, minimal interaction |


### 3. Stakeholder Prioritization

* **High Priority:** Menno Drescher (Sponsor), Development Team, End-Users (early adopters for feedback).  Active management and frequent communication are crucial.
* **Medium Priority:** Project Management, Azure OpenAI (for potential integration issues). Regular monitoring and communication are needed.
* **Low Priority:** Other AI providers, NPM. Minimal effort, primarily monitoring for any significant issues.


### 4. Stakeholder Requirements and Expectations

* **Menno Drescher:** Successful product launch, positive user feedback, potential for future development and monetization.
* **Development Team:** Clear requirements, adequate resources, timely feedback, professional development opportunities.
* **End-Users:** User-friendly interface, accurate PMBOK documentation, reliable performance, good customer support.
* **Azure OpenAI:**  Adherence to their terms of service, timely payment (if applicable), potential for case studies or testimonials.
* **Other AI Providers:**  Similar to Azure OpenAI, but less critical due to their secondary role.


Potential Conflicts:  A conflict might arise if End-Users demand features that significantly increase development time and cost, clashing with the Sponsor's timeline and budget.


### 5. Communication Preferences

| Stakeholder         | Preferred Methods        | Frequency       | Information Needs                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Menno Drescher       | Email, Video Calls      | Weekly           | Progress reports, key decisions, risk assessments   |
| Development Team     | Project Management Tools, Daily Stand-ups | Daily           | Task assignments, code reviews, technical updates |
| End-Users            | Online documentation, Forum, Email  | As needed       | Release notes, tutorials, support documentation  |
| Azure OpenAI          | API documentation, Email   | As needed       | Technical support, billing information             |
| Other AI Providers   | Email, API Documentation | As needed       | Similar to Azure OpenAI                             |


### 6. Engagement Strategies

* **High-Influence Stakeholders (Menno & Development Team):**  Direct, frequent communication, collaborative decision-making, regular feedback sessions.
* **Resistant Stakeholders:** Proactive communication addressing concerns, demonstrating value proposition, involving them early in the process.  This is less of a concern given the nature of the project.
* **Champions (Menno):** Maintain open communication, recognize contributions, leverage their influence to promote the project.


### 7. Risk Assessment

| Risk                               | Likelihood | Impact     | Mitigation Strategy                                     | Contingency Plan                               |
|------------------------------------|------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| API key issues (Azure OpenAI)      | Medium     | High       | Redundant API keys, multiple provider options          | Switch to alternative AI provider                 |
| Unmet end-user expectations        | Medium     | Medium     | Beta testing, user feedback incorporation, iterative development | Release a minimal viable product (MVP) first        |
| Development delays                  | Medium     | High       | Agile methodology, clear task assignments, risk tracking | Adjust project scope, prioritize critical features |
| Negative user reviews              | Low        | Medium     | Proactive community engagement, responsive customer support | Address negative feedback, improve the product    |


This Stakeholder Analysis document provides a comprehensive overview.  The details within each section would be expanded upon in a real-world project, especially the Influence/Impact Matrix and the Risk Assessment.  Further stakeholder engagement will refine this analysis throughout the project lifecycle.
