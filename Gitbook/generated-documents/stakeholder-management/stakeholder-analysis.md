* **Executive Sponsor(s):**  Crucial for securing budget, resources, and overall project success.  Regular updates, clear communication of milestones and risks, and proactive problem-solving are essential.
* **Development Team:**  Directly responsible for building and deploying the API.  Clear requirements, open communication channels, and collaborative problem-solving are necessary.
* **Fortune 500 Clients:** Their feedback and validation are critical for success.  Dedicated communication channels, regular demos, and responsiveness to their needs are paramount.

**High Power, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied):**
