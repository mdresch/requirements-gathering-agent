**2. Stakeholder Assessment**

**Power/Interest Grid:**

| Quadrant      | Power      | Interest    | Stakeholder Examples                               | Engagement Strategy                                          |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Power/High Interest** | High        | High        | Project Sponsor, Development Team, Product Owner, PMO | Close collaboration, frequent communication, active management |
| **High Power/Low Interest** | High        | Low         | IT Operations, Legal/Compliance                   | Keep informed, regular updates, address concerns promptly     |

**Influence/Impact Matrix:** (Similar to Power/Interest, but focusing on specific project outcomes)  This would require a more detailed assessment based on specific project deliverables and their impact.


**Stakeholder Attitudes:**  Initial assessment suggests mostly supportive attitudes, particularly amongst primary stakeholders.  End-user engagement will be crucial to gauge and address potential concerns.

**Current Engagement Levels:**  Currently minimal, as the product is pre-release.  Engagement strategies are essential for launch and ongoing success.


**3. Stakeholder Prioritization**

* **High Priority:** Project Sponsor, Development Team, Product Owner, PMO, End-Users (Project Managers & Business Analysts)

**5. Communication Preferences**

This requires further investigation through surveys and interviews.  However, a preliminary approach might include:

* **Project Sponsor:** Regular meetings, email updates, formal reports.
