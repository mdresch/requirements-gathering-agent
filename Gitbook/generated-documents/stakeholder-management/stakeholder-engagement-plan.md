# Stakeholder Engagement Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction and Purpose**

This Stakeholder Engagement Plan outlines the strategy for effectively engaging stakeholders throughout the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project lifecycle.  The plan aims to ensure clear communication, manage expectations, and foster collaboration to achieve project success.  Effective stakeholder engagement is critical for the successful adoption and utilization of the RGA tool.

**2. Stakeholder Identification and Analysis**

The following table identifies key stakeholders and categorizes them based on their influence and interest in the project.  This categorization informs the engagement strategy.  Stakeholder information is drawn from the `stakeholder-analysis.md`, `stakeholders.md`, and relevant project documents.

* **Leading Stakeholders:**  Proactive, frequent communication, active collaboration in decision-making, and involvement in all key project phases.  Methods include regular meetings, email updates, and direct access to project information.

* **Supportive Stakeholders:**  Regular updates, feedback requests, and opportunities for input.  Methods include newsletters, progress reports, and occasional meetings.

* **Neutral Stakeholders:**  Initial outreach to build awareness and interest, followed by regular updates and opportunities for engagement. Methods include presentations, demonstrations, and written communication.

**10. Timing and Frequency of Engagement Activities**

Stakeholder engagement activities will be scheduled throughout the project lifecycle, with increased frequency during critical phases such as requirements gathering, testing, and deployment.


**11. Risk Management for Stakeholder Engagement**

Potential risks include:

* **Lack of communication:**  Leading to misunderstandings and conflicts.
* **Resistance to change:**  From stakeholders who are resistant to adopting new tools or processes.
* **Unrealistic expectations:**  From stakeholders who have unrealistic expectations of the tool's capabilities.

Mitigation strategies include:

**12. Success Metrics and Measurement**

The success of the stakeholder engagement plan will be measured by:

* **Stakeholder satisfaction:**  Measured through surveys and feedback.
* **Project success:**  Achieving project objectives on time and within budget.
* **Tool adoption:**  The number of end-users adopting and using the RGA tool.
* **Issue resolution:**  The timeliness and effectiveness of addressing stakeholder concerns.


This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued effectiveness.
