### User Story 1: Installation and Setup

**As a** developer  
**I want** to install and set up the Requirements Gathering Agent easily  
**so that** I can quickly start generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation without configuration issues.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The agent can be installed globally via `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent`.
- The agent can be run directly without installation via `npx requirements-gathering-agent`.
- A `.env` configuration file can be created with sample entries for all supported AI providers.
- Clear error messages are shown if required environment variables are missing or invalid.
- Documentation includes step-by-step installation and setup instructions.

### User Story 2: Generate Complete PMBOK Documentation

**As a** project manager  
**I want** to generate a full suite of 28 PMBOK-compliant documents from a project README  
**so that** I can have professional and standardized project management documentation automatically created.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Running `requirements-gathering-agent` without options generates all PMBOK documents.
- The output directory structure follows the defined format with categorized folders.
- All 28 documents listed under features are generated and saved in their appropriate folders.
- Each generated document is complete, professional, and formatted consistently.
- The README.md master index file is generated in the root output folder.

### User Story 3: Generate Core Documents Only

**As a** business analyst  
**I want** to generate only the core analysis documents  
**so that** I can focus quickly on user stories, personas, and key requirements without extra output.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Running `requirements-gathering-agent --core-only` generates only documents under `core-analysis/`.
- No other document categories are generated.
- Core documents include Project Summary and Goals, User Stories and Requirements, User Personas, and Key Roles and Needs Analysis.
- Output directory contains only the core-analysis folder and README.md.

### User Story 4: Support Multiple AI Providers

**As a** developer  
**I want** the agent to support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama)  
**so that** I can choose the most suitable or available AI backend for my environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The `.env` file can be configured for Azure OpenAI with Entra ID, API key, GitHub AI, or Ollama.
- The agent detects and uses the configured AI provider endpoint and model correctly.
- Authentication works with Azure CLI login for Entra ID or API keys/tokens as applicable.
- Switching between AI providers requires only environment configuration changes.
- Clear error messages and logs indicate the AI provider in use and any authentication issues.

### User Story 5: Robust Error Handling and Retry Logic

**As a** user running the agent in an enterprise environment  
**I want** the agent to handle errors gracefully and retry failed document generations  
**so that** transient issues do not cause incomplete outputs and reduce manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When running with `--with-retry`, failed document generations are retried up to a configurable number of times.
- Errors such as API timeouts, rate limits, or network issues are caught and logged.
- The process continues generating other documents even if some fail initially.
- A summary report is generated indicating which documents succeeded, failed, or were retried.
- Retry logic can be enabled or disabled via command line options.

### User Story 6: Generate Management Plans Only

**As a** project planner  
**I want** to generate only the PMBOK management plans  
**so that** I can focus on scope, risk, cost, quality, resource, communication, and procurement plans independently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Running `requirements-gathering-agent --management-plans` generates only documents under the `management-plans/` folder.
- All seven management plans specified are generated.
- The output directory contains only the management-plans folder and README.md.
- No other document categories are generated.

### User Story 7: Generate Planning Artifacts Only

**As a** project scheduler  
**I want** to generate only planning artifacts such as WBS, activity lists, and schedules  
**so that** I can prepare detailed project plans without extraneous documents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Running `requirements-gathering-agent --planning-artifacts` generates only the planning artifacts documents.
- Generated documents include WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List and Estimates, Schedule Network Diagram, and Milestone List.
- Output directory contains only the `planning-artifacts/` folder and README.md.
- No other document categories are generated.

### User Story 8: Generate Technical Analysis Only

**As a** technical lead  
**I want** to generate technical analysis documents such as technology stack, data models, and risk analysis  
**so that** I can review and plan the technical aspects of the project effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Running `requirements-gathering-agent --technical-analysis` generates only the technical analysis documents.
- Documents include Technology Stack Analysis, Data Model Suggestions, Risk Analysis, Acceptance Criteria, Compliance Considerations, and UI/UX Considerations.
- Output directory contains only the `technical-analysis/` folder and README.md.
- No other document categories are generated.

### User Story 9: Easy Authentication Setup

**As a** user  
**I want** simple authentication options for AI providers including Azure OpenAI with Entra ID and API keys  
**so that** I can securely access AI services without complex setup.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can authenticate with Azure OpenAI using `az login` for Entra ID.
- Users can authenticate with Azure OpenAI using an API key set in `.env`.
- Users can authenticate with GitHub AI using a GitHub token.
- Users can authenticate with Ollama by running `ollama serve`.
- Instructions for each method are clearly documented.
- The agent validates authentication before generating documents and provides meaningful error messages if authentication fails.

### User Story 10: Developer Experience and Contribution

**As a** contributor to the project  
**I want** clear development instructions and a modern codebase  
**so that** I can easily contribute and extend the Requirements Gathering Agent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The repository includes instructions for cloning, installing dependencies, building, and running locally.
- The codebase is implemented in TypeScript with type safety.
- Build scripts and start commands are available via npm scripts.
