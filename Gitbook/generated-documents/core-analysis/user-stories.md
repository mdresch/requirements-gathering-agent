## User Stories for Requirements Gathering Agent

Here are detailed user stories for the Requirements Gathering Agent, following the "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format, including acceptance criteria:

**1. Project Manager Generating PMBOK Documentation:**

* **As a Project Manager,** I want to generate a complete suite of PMBOK compliant project documentation from my project's README file, so that I can quickly and efficiently create a professional project management plan.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool successfully generates all 28 documents as outlined in the documentation.
        * The generated documents adhere to PMBOK standards.
        * The output is organized into the specified directory structure.
        * The tool handles different README file formats (e.g., Markdown, plain text).
        * The generated documents are easily readable and understandable.

**2. Project Manager Generating Core Documents Only:**

* **As a Project Manager,** I want to generate only the core PMBOK documents (Project Summary, User Stories, User Personas, Key Roles Analysis), so that I can focus on the essential project requirements quickly.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool generates only the documents specified under "Core Analysis" in the documentation.
        * The generated documents are complete and accurate.
        * The output is organized correctly within the "core-analysis" directory.

**3. Developer Configuring the Tool for Azure OpenAI:**

* **As a Developer,** I want to configure the tool to use my Azure OpenAI service with Entra ID authentication, so that I can leverage the power of GPT-4 for document generation securely.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool successfully connects to my Azure OpenAI resource using Entra ID.
        * The tool correctly uses the specified deployment name.
        * The tool handles authentication errors gracefully.
        * Clear error messages are provided if authentication fails.


**4. Developer Configuring the Tool for Alternative AI Providers:**

* **As a Developer,** I want to be able to configure the tool to use different AI providers (Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama), so that I can choose the provider best suited for my needs and budget.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool successfully connects to and utilizes the selected AI provider (Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, or Ollama).
        *  Appropriate API keys or tokens are correctly handled for each provider.
        *  The tool provides clear error messages if the connection or API key is invalid.
        *  The tool gracefully handles different model names and parameters for each provider.

**5. User Handling API Key Errors:**

* **As a User,** I want the tool to provide informative error messages if my API key or authentication is invalid, so that I can quickly identify and resolve the issue.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool provides specific error messages indicating the cause of the authentication failure (e.g., invalid API key, incorrect endpoint).
        * The error messages guide the user on how to resolve the issue (e.g., check API key, verify endpoint URL).
        * The tool does not crash or produce unexpected behavior due to invalid credentials.

**6. User Utilizing Retry Logic:**

* **As a User,** I want the option to enable retry logic for failed document generation attempts, so that transient network issues or API limitations do not prevent successful completion.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The `--with-retry` flag successfully enables retry functionality.
        * The tool attempts to regenerate failed documents a specified number of times.
        * The tool logs retry attempts and their outcomes.
        * The tool provides a summary of successful and failed document generations.


**7. User Reviewing Generated Documents:**

* **As a Project Manager,** I want to easily review the generated documents in a well-organized manner, so that I can quickly assess the completeness and accuracy of the generated project plan.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The generated documents are logically grouped into folders.
        * A master README file provides an index to all generated documents.
        * The generated documents are formatted in a readable way (e.g., Markdown, plain text).


These user stories provide a comprehensive starting point for developing and testing the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Further stories could be added to cover specific aspects of individual document generation or edge cases.
