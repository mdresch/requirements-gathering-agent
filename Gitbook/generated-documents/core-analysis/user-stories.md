### User Story 1: AI Provider Configuration Flexibility

**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** to configure the AI provider by switching between Azure OpenAI (with Entra ID or API key), GitHub AI models, and local Ollama AI,  
**so that** I can ensure maximum flexibility, reliability, and security for different deployment environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system supports setting environment variables for each AI provider option.
- Switching AI providers only requires updating environment variables without code changes.
- The system automatically falls back to a secondary AI provider if the primary provider fails.
- The `.env` configuration examples document all supported providers clearly.
- Authentication mechanisms for each provider (e.g., Entra ID login, API keys, GitHub token) are verified before use.
- The CLI or API reports clear errors if the AI provider is misconfigured.

### User Story 2: Generate Strategic Planning Documents

**As a** project manager,  
**I want** to generate strategic planning documents (vision, mission, core values, purpose) automatically based on the business problem and technology stack,  
**so that** I can kickstart project alignment and ensure consistent strategic direction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system accepts `businessProblem`, `technologyStack`, and `contextBundle` as inputs.
- The system produces well-structured vision, mission, core values, and purpose statements.
- The generated documents are clear, relevant, and aligned with the input context.
- The output is returned in a JSON object with keys: `vision`, `mission`, `coreValues`, `purpose`.
- The API and CLI support generating these sections on demand.
- Generated text is free of grammatical errors and suitable for inclusion in project documentation.

### User Story 3: Comprehensive Requirements Generation

**As a** business analyst,  
**I want** to generate detailed user roles, their needs, and associated processes automatically from the project context,  
**so that** I can accurately capture and analyze user requirements for the project.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system accepts `businessProblem`, `technologyStack`, and `contextBundle` as inputs.
- The output is an array of user role objects, each containing:
  - A user role name.
  - A list of needs for that role.
  - A list of relevant processes for that role.
- The generated roles and needs cover all major stakeholders and user groups.
- The requirements are clear, actionable, and traceable.
- The system produces output in strict JSON format for integration.
- The API and CLI allow generating requirements separately or as part of a full documentation suite.

### User Story 4: Automatic PMBOK Documentation Generation

**As a** project management office (PMO) specialist,  
**I want** to generate PMBOK-aligned project management documentation automatically,  
**so that** I can save time preparing standardized and compliant project artifacts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system supports generating all key PMBOK documents within the Initiating and Planning Process Groups, including:
  - Project Charter
  - Stakeholder Register
  - Scope Management Plan
  - Requirements Management Plan
  - Schedule Management Plan
  - Cost Management Plan
  - Quality Management Plan
  - Resource Management Plan
  - Communications Management Plan
  - Risk Management Plan
  - Procurement Management Plan
  - Stakeholder Engagement Plan
- The system also generates detailed planning artifacts such as WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List, etc.
- Each document aligns with PMBOK standards and includes appropriate sections and detail.
- The system accepts consistent input formats and produces documents in markdown or JSON as appropriate.
- The generated documents can be output via API or CLI.
- The system handles large documents by supporting high-token LLM models.
- The output documents are suitable for direct use or further customization by project teams.

### User Story 5: Command-Line Interface for Document Generation

**As a** software developer or project manager,  
**I want** to use a command-line interface (CLI) to generate project management documents directly,  
**so that** I can integrate documentation generation into automated workflows and CI/CD pipelines.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The CLI allows specifying the project context and AI provider configuration.
- Commands exist to generate all PMBOK documents or specific documents on demand.
- The CLI uses environment variables for provider credentials and model selection.
- Generated documents are saved in organized directories (e.g., `/docs`, `/pmbok`).
- The CLI supports build, run, and development modes (`npm run build`, `npm start`, `npm run dev`).
- Clear success and error messages are displayed after generation.
- The CLI supports switching AI models and providers via environment variables without code changes.

### User Story 6: Local AI Support for Offline Development

**As a** developer working in restricted or offline environments,  
**I want** to use a local AI model (Ollama) to generate requirements and documentation,  
**so that** I can continue development without internet access or API rate limits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system supports configuring Ollama as the AI provider with endpoint `http://localhost:11434`.
- The system can detect Ollama availability and prompt to start the service if not running.
- Models like `llama2` can be pulled and used locally.
- The system falls back automatically to Ollama if other providers fail or are unavailable.
- Output formats and functionality are consistent with cloud AI providers.
- Documentation and CLI commands include instructions for Ollama setup and usage.

### User Story 7: Technology Stack Analysis and Recommendations

**As a** technical architect,  
**I want** the system to analyze the proposed technology stack and provide technical architecture recommendations,  
**so that** the project can leverage best practices and suitable technologies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Input includes the current technology stack and project context.
- The system outputs an analysis report including:
  - Strengths and weaknesses of the stack.
  - Recommendations for additional or alternative technologies.
  - Considerations for scalability, security, compliance, and maintainability.
- The output is detailed, actionable, and aligns with enterprise standards.
- The analysis is delivered in a consistent format (markdown or JSON).
- The system can generate this as a standalone report or as part of the overall documentation.

### User Story 8: Risk Identification, Analysis, and Mitigation Planning

**As a** risk manager,  
**I want** to generate a comprehensive risk management plan including risk identification, analysis, and mitigation strategies,  
**so that** the project team can proactively manage potential risks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The risk management plan includes:
  - Identified project-specific risks.
  - Risk probability and impact analysis.
  - Proposed mitigation and contingency strategies.
- The plan aligns with PMBOK risk management standards.
- The system accepts project context and technology stack for relevant risk identification.
- Output is structured for easy integration into overall project documentation.
- The system produces clear, actionable recommendations for risk owners and monitoring.

### User Story 9: Enforce Strict JSON Output for Integration

**As a** integration engineer,  
**I want** the system to enforce strict JSON output when generating requirements and roles,  
**so that** I can reliably consume and integrate the data into other tools and workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All relevant API functions produce valid, well-formed JSON.
- The system validates JSON output before returning or writing to files.
- Errors related to JSON formatting are caught and reported clearly.
- The JSON output schema is documented and consistent.
- The CLI supports specifying output format preferences (JSON or markdown).
- Integration examples and sample outputs are provided.

### User Story 10: Modular Architecture for Flexible Implementation

**As a** software architect,  
**I want** the tool to have a modular architecture,  
**so that** I can integrate or extend specific functionality (e.g., strategic planning, PMBOK documents) independently in my projects.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The codebase exposes separate modules/functions for:
  - Strategic planning generation.
  - Requirements gathering.
  - Each PMBOK document type.
  - Analysis functions (tech stack, risk, compliance, UI/UX).
- Modules can be imported separately without loading the entire system.
- The system supports usage as an npm package or direct copy.
- Documentation includes clear API references for all modules.
- The architecture supports adding new AI providers or document types with minimal changes.
