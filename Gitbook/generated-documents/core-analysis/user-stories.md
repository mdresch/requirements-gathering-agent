## User Stories for Requirements Gathering Agent

Here are detailed user stories for the Requirements Gathering Agent, following the "As a [user type], I want [goal] so that [benefit]" format, including acceptance criteria:

**Core Functionality:**

1. **As a project manager,** I want to generate a complete suite of PMBOK-compliant project documents from a project's README file, so that I can quickly and efficiently create a comprehensive project plan.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool successfully generates all 28 documents as outlined in the documentation.
        * The generated documents adhere to PMBOK standards.
        * The output is organized into the specified directory structure.
        * The generated documents are correctly formatted (e.g., Markdown, Word, etc., depending on implementation).
        * The tool handles various README file formats (e.g., Markdown, plain text).


2. **As a project manager,** I want to choose which subsets of PMBOK documents to generate (e.g., core documents only, management plans only), so that I can tailor the output to my specific needs and avoid unnecessary documentation.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The `--core-only`, `--management-plans`, `--planning-artifacts`, and `--technical-analysis` command-line options function correctly.
        * The tool only generates the selected document subsets.
        * The output directory structure reflects the selected subsets.


3. **As a project manager,** I want the tool to retry failed document generation attempts, so that I can increase the robustness of the process and reduce the risk of incomplete documentation.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The `--with-retry` command-line option is functional.
        * The tool attempts to regenerate failed documents a configurable number of times.
        * The tool logs retry attempts and their results.
        * The tool provides clear error messages when retry attempts fail.


4. **As a developer,** I want to configure the tool to use different AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama), so that I can leverage the best provider for my needs and budget.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool supports configuration via a `.env` file.
        * The tool correctly connects to and uses each supported AI provider.
        * The tool handles different API keys and authentication methods for each provider.
        * The tool gracefully handles errors related to AI provider connectivity and authentication.


5. **As a user,** I want clear and concise instructions on how to install and use the tool, including examples, so that I can easily get started with generating project documentation.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The README file contains comprehensive installation and usage instructions.
        * The instructions include clear examples of command-line usage.
        * The instructions cover all supported AI providers and their respective configurations.


**Advanced Features & Error Handling:**

6. **As a project manager,** I want the tool to handle various error conditions gracefully (e.g., network errors, API rate limits, invalid API keys), providing informative error messages, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The tool provides informative error messages for all anticipated error conditions.
        * The tool logs errors to a file for debugging purposes.
        * The tool handles API rate limits gracefully, potentially implementing waiting mechanisms.


7. **As a developer,** I want the tool to be easily extensible to support new AI providers and PMBOK document types, so that it can adapt to future changes in the project management landscape and AI technology.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * The codebase is well-structured and modular, facilitating easy extension.
        * The codebase includes clear documentation on how to add new AI providers and document types.
        *  Unit tests are in place to ensure the reliability of new additions.


8. **As a security officer,** I want the tool to securely handle API keys and authentication credentials, preventing unauthorized access and data breaches, so that sensitive information is protected.
    * **Acceptance Criteria:**
        * API keys and credentials are not hardcoded in the source code.
        * The tool uses environment variables to store sensitive information.
        * The tool adheres to best practices for secure handling of API keys and authentication credentials.  Consideration of secrets management systems.
