# Project Summary and Goals

## Project Summary

### Project Name:
Requirements Gathering Agent  

### High-Level Description:
The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript module designed to automate the generation of PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge)-compliant documentation for software projects. The tool leverages Azure OpenAI and other AI providers to streamline project management workflows, reduce manual effort, and enhance compliance and documentation quality.

### Purpose and Primary Function:
The primary function of the Requirements Gathering Agent is to transform project documentation (e.g., README.md and other markdown files) into a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents. It automates the requirements gathering process, provides intelligent context analysis, and produces artifacts such as project charters, stakeholder registers, risk management plans, and scope management plans.

### Target Users and Stakeholders:
- **Primary Users:**  
  - Project Managers  
  - Business Analysts  
  - Software Development Teams  
  - Product Owners  
- **Secondary Users:**  
  - Consulting Firms  
  - Regulatory Bodies  
  - Vendors managing formal project documentation  

### Key Features and Capabilities:
- **Comprehensive PMBOK Document Suite:** Generates 29 professional documents aligned with PMBOK standards.  
- **Enhanced Project Analysis:** Analyzes all markdown files beyond README.md for richer project context.  
- **Intelligent Context Management:** Scores and prioritizes documentation sources for relevance (0-100).  
- **Validation and Quality Assurance:** Ensures cross-document consistency and PMBOK compliance.  
- **Multiple AI Providers:** Supports Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama.  
- **Enterprise-Ready Implementation:** Includes retry logic, error handling, and CI/CD compatibility.  
- **Scalable Context Utilization:** Optimizes token usage for large language models (up to 2M tokens).  

### Technical Approach Overview:
The tool employs a modular architecture with core components such as a **Context Management System**, **Document Generation Engine**, and **AI Provider Integration**. It uses TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, integrates with leading AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and features robust CLI tools for user interaction and automation.
