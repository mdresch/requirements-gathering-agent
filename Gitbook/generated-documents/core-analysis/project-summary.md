# Project Summary: Requirements Gathering Agent

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is an AI-powered enterprise-grade solution designed to automate comprehensive requirements gathering and project management documentation aligned with the **Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)** framework. It supports multiple AI providers—including Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI Models, Ollama (local AI), and Azure AI Studio—to provide flexible, reliable, and secure AI-driven generation of strategic planning artifacts, stakeholder analysis, management plans, detailed project artifacts, risk and compliance assessments, and technical recommendations.

This tool streamlines the traditionally manual, time-consuming, and expertise-heavy process of project documentation creation, enabling faster, standardized, and high-quality project initiation, planning, and analysis phases. It is designed for seamless integration in Node.js/TypeScript environments with modular architecture, command-line interface support, and strict JSON output for easy downstream integration into enterprise workflows.
