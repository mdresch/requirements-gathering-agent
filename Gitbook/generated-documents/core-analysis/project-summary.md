## Requirements Gathering Agent: Project Summary and Goals

### Project Summary

The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered command-line tool built using Node.js and TypeScript.  Its primary function is to automate the generation of comprehensive project management documentation conforming to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  Instead of relying solely on a project's README file, it intelligently analyzes all relevant documentation within a project's directory structure (including requirements documents, architecture specifications, stakeholder information, and planning documents), scoring each source for relevance (0-100). This comprehensive analysis enables the generation of a complete suite of 29 PMBOK documents, including a project charter, management plans (scope, risk, cost, quality, resource, communication, procurement), planning artifacts (WBS, WBS dictionary, activity list, schedule network diagram), stakeholder management documents, and technical analysis reports. The tool integrates with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama), leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro to maximize context utilization and documentation accuracy.  The output is organized into a professional directory structure for easy access and review.  The tool also includes robust validation features to ensure PMBOK compliance and provides detailed quality assessment reports with actionable recommendations.  Target users include project managers, PMO teams, business analysts, and software developers needing standardized and comprehensive project documentation.
