# Project Summary: Requirements Gathering Agent

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is an AI-powered software tool designed to automate and streamline the creation of comprehensive project management documentation in alignment with the PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) standards. Leveraging advanced AI models such as GPT-4 via Azure OpenAI and other AI providers, this tool transforms a project’s basic README input into a full suite of professional documents that cover every critical aspect of project management.

By generating 28 distinct, categorized PMBOK-compliant documents covering core analysis, project charter, management plans, planning artifacts, stakeholder management, and technical analysis, the Requirements Gathering Agent significantly accelerates the project planning process. It ensures consistency, completeness, and professional quality in project documentation, which facilitates better communication, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.

This solution is enterprise-ready, supporting robust error handling, retry mechanisms, and multiple AI provider integrations, ensuring reliability and flexibility. It is implemented in TypeScript for modern, type-safe development and can be easily installed and run via npm with configurable authentication options including Azure Entra ID and API keys.
