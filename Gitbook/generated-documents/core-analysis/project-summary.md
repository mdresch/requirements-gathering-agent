**Built with ❤️ by [Menno Drescher] (https://exceptional-cba-project.webflow.io/) using Azure OpenAI**

## 🟡 Outstanding/Recent Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Zero Tokens in Context for Some Documents
- **Symptom:** Some generated documents (e.g., user-personas) showed `Final context: 0 tokens`.
- **Root Cause:** The Enhanced Context Manager was not being populated with the discovered markdown files from project analysis, resulting in an empty context for those documents.
- **Fix:** Added logic to ensure all discovered markdown files are added to the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context before document generation. Now, each document receives the full relevant context, and token counts reflect actual content.

### Issue: CLI Permission Denied (`npx rga`)
- **Symptom:** Running `npx rga` resulted in `Permission denied`.
- **Root Cause:** The CLI binary was not executable or not properly linked after build.
- **Fix:** Ensured the CLI is built (`npm run build`), has executable permissions (`chmod +x dist/cli.js`), and is correctly linked in the npm bin directory. Also, documented alternative run commands (`npm start`, `node dist/cli.js`).

### Issue: Enhanced Context Not Utilized for Large Models
- **Symptom:** Large language models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) were not utilizing their full context window.
- **Root Cause:** The context manager was not auto-detecting model capabilities or was too conservative in context allocation.
- **Fix:** Improved model detection and context allocation logic. Now, up to 90% of available tokens are used for ultra-large models, maximizing documentation accuracy.

## 🔧 Suggestions for Further Improvement

The Requirements Gathering Agent is robust and production-ready, but here are some areas for future enhancement—especially in the project analysis and context-building system:

- **Direct Context Injection:**  
  Add a function to directly inject all high-relevance markdown files into the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context, not just the combined context string. This will further improve per-document context building and accuracy for large LLMs.

- **Async Parallelization:**  
  For very large projects, consider parallelizing directory scans to speed up project analysis and markdown discovery.

- **Configurable Limits:**  
  Allow configuration of the maximum number of files and maximum content length included in the context via CLI options or environment variables, giving users more control over context size and performance.

- **Custom Directory Patterns:**  
  Enable users to specify additional directories or filename patterns to include or exclude in the analysis, making the tool even more flexible for diverse project structures.

- **Context Utilization Feedback:**  
  Provide real-time feedback or warnings if the context is being truncated due to token limits, and suggest ways to optimize context inclusion.
