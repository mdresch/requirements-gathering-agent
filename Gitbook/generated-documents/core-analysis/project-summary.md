# Project Summary and Goals

## Project Summary

### Project Name
**Requirements Gathering Agent**

### High-Level Description
The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-driven tool designed to automate the generation of project management documentation compliant with PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) standards. It leverages advanced AI capabilities, including Azure OpenAI and other providers, to produce accurate, comprehensive, and stakeholder-specific outputs for software projects.

### Purpose and Primary Function
The primary purpose of the Requirements Gathering Agent is to streamline the traditionally manual, time-consuming process of project documentation creation. By automating compliance validation, context building, and generating PMBOK-aligned artifacts, the tool ensures consistency, accuracy, and governance adherence while significantly reducing administrative overhead.

### Target Users and Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Project Managers, Business Analysts, Program Managers, Compliance Officers.
- **Secondary Users**: PMOs, software development teams, consulting firms, regulatory bodies, and organizations requiring formal project documentation.
- **Stakeholders**: Enterprise teams seeking consistent documentation workflows, and organizations aiming to improve project success rates through better planning and alignment.

### Key Features and Capabilities
- **PMBOK Document Suite**: Generates 29 compliant documents, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, and risk management plans.
- **Enhanced Project Analysis**: Automatically discovers and scores relevant documentation across the entire project directory, ensuring a rich context for document generation.
- **AI-Powered Context Management**: Utilizes a 3-phase strategy to maximize context utilization for large AI models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4.
- **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive PMBOK compliance checks, cross-document consistency validation, and detailed quality scoring.
- **Multi-Provider AI Integration**: Supports Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama, ensuring flexibility and reliability.
- **Enterprise-Ready Design**: Includes robust error handling, modular architecture, and CI/CD compatibility.

### Technical Approach Overview
The tool is built using **TypeScript** and **Node.js** for type safety, scalability, and maintainability. It integrates multiple AI providers for text generation and analysis, leveraging advanced context management techniques to optimize token utilization and ensure that large language models deliver accurate, stakeholder-specific documentation.
