### 2. Background and Business Need

Organizations struggle with creating comprehensive, standardized project management documentation that complies with PMBOK 7.0 standards. Manual creation of the required 29+ PMBOK documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and often inconsistent across projects. This leads to:

- **Inefficient project initiation** due to incomplete or delayed documentation
- **Compliance risks** from non-standardized documentation practices
- **Resource drain** as project managers spend excessive time on documentation instead of strategic activities
- **Inconsistent project communication** due to varying documentation quality
- **Difficulty in project comparison and portfolio management**

### 3. Project Objectives
