# Project Statement of Work

## Project Description

### Overview  
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** is a cutting-edge Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. By leveraging Azure AI and other AI providers, the system streamlines the traditionally manual, error-prone process of creating project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, and other essential artifacts. This tool addresses the growing need for efficient, standardized documentation in modern project management workflows.

### Business Context and Background  
Modern project management requires consistent, high-quality documentation to align stakeholders, define scope, and ensure compliance with industry standards. However, the manual creation of these documents is time-intensive and prone to inconsistencies, leading to delays, increased costs, and compliance risks. The **Requirements Gathering Agent** provides an AI-augmented solution to automate documentation creation, reduce administrative overhead, and improve stakeholder alignment.

### Problem Statement and Opportunity  
Manual documentation processes are inefficient and often fail to meet the rigorous standards set by PMBOK, leading to compliance issues and project delays. The opportunity lies in automating this process using AI to ensure accuracy, standardization, and governance while reducing effort and time to produce these artifacts.

### High-Level Solution Approach  
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** will use AI-powered analysis and document generation capabilities to produce PMBOK-aligned project documentation. Key features include multi-provider AI integration, intelligent context management, and compliance validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards. The tool will be delivered as a CLI application for ease of use in software development and enterprise environments.
