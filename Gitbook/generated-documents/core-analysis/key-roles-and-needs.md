Based on the provided documentation for the `requirements-gathering-agent`, several key user roles and their needs can be identified:

**1. Project Manager (PM):**

* **Needs:** The PM is the primary user and needs a comprehensive and easily accessible set of PMBOK-compliant project documents.  They need the tool to quickly generate a complete project management plan, including scope, risk, cost, quality, resource, communication, and procurement management plans.  The PM also needs the core analysis documents (user stories, personas, key roles and needs analysis) to understand the project's foundation.  Ease of use and quick generation of documents are paramount to save time.  Integration with existing project management tools would be a valuable addition.

**2. Business Analyst (BA):**

* **Needs:** The BA needs the tool to efficiently generate detailed user stories, requirements, and user personas.  The core analysis section is crucial for their work.  The ability to easily export and share these documents with stakeholders is essential.  They may also find the technical analysis documents helpful in understanding the technological implications of the project.

**3. Software Developer/Engineer:**

* **Needs:** Developers need the technical analysis documents (technology stack, data model suggestions, risk analysis, acceptance criteria, compliance considerations, UI/UX considerations) to inform their development process.  Clear and concise documentation is essential for them to understand the project's technical requirements.

**4. Stakeholder:**

* **Needs:** Stakeholders (clients, end-users, executives) need easily understandable summaries of the project's goals, scope, and progress.  They may need access to specific documents, like the project charter or stakeholder engagement plan.  The tool should produce documents that are easily digestible and accessible for non-technical stakeholders.


**5. System Administrator/DevOps Engineer:**

* **Needs:** This role needs to ensure the tool is properly configured and integrated with the chosen AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, or Ollama). They need to manage API keys, authentication, and troubleshoot any technical issues related to the tool's operation.  Understanding the system requirements and dependencies is crucial.


**6. Product Owner:**

* **Needs:** Similar to the Project Manager, but with a stronger focus on the user stories, requirements, and the overall value proposition of the project.  They need to ensure the generated documents accurately reflect the product vision and roadmap.


These roles have overlapping needs, especially in terms of accessing and understanding the core analysis documents. The tool's success depends on catering to the specific needs of each role while ensuring seamless collaboration between them.
