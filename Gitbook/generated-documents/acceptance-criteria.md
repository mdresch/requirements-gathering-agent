# Acceptance Criteria: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Acceptance will be determined by successful completion of all criteria listed below.  Testing will be conducted using a combination of unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

**I. Core Functionality:**

* **A. PMBOK Document Generation:**
    * **AC1.1:**  The system shall generate all 29 PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents listed in the project documentation, accurately reflecting the input project context derived from the README and associated project files.  Each document shall be structurally sound and contain all required sections as per PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.
    * **AC1.2:** The system shall correctly identify and process all relevant markdown files within the project directory structure, including but not limited to those located in `requirements/`, `specs/`, `specifications/`, `docs/`, `design/`, `planning/`, `.github/`, and `wiki/`.
    * **AC1.3:** The system shall accurately score the relevance of discovered files (0-100) based on content relevance, file location, naming patterns, content structure, and content depth.  This scoring shall inform the prioritization of context during document generation.
    * **AC1.4:** The generated documents shall be formatted correctly in Markdown (.md) format, unless otherwise specified via command line arguments.  Alternative formats (JSON, YAML) should be accurately rendered when requested.
    * **AC1.5:** The system shall provide a mechanism to generate only specific subsets of documents (e.g., core documents, stakeholder documents, planning artifacts) via command line arguments.
    * **AC1.6:** The system shall handle errors gracefully, providing informative error messages and allowing for retry mechanisms as specified in the command line options.


* **B. Strategic Document Generation:**
    * **AC2.1:** The system shall generate professional-quality strategic business documents including, but not limited to, Purpose Statements and Company Values, accurately reflecting the project's mission, goals, and capabilities.
    * **AC2.2:**  The generated strategic documents shall demonstrate a deep understanding of the project context and translate technical details into authentic and compelling corporate communications.
    * **AC2.3:** The generated strategic documents shall be suitable for executive presentations and corporate websites.


* **C. Enhanced Context Manager:**
    * **AC3.1:** The system shall implement a three-phase context strategy, adapting to the capabilities of the chosen AI model (e.g., token limits).
    * **AC3.2:**  The system shall achieve a minimum context utilization of 20% for large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Claude, and 90% for ultra-large models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro, with a clear report showing token usage and performance indicators.
    * **AC3.3:** The system shall provide detailed reporting and analytics on context performance, including token counts, utilization percentages, and performance assessments.


* **D. PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:**
    * **AC4.1:** The system shall validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, identifying missing elements, inconsistencies, and providing actionable recommendations for improvement.
    * **AC4.2:** The system shall provide a comprehensive compliance report with a numerical score (0-100) reflecting the level of PMBOK 7.0 compliance for each generated document.


* **E. Version Control System:**
    * **AC5.1:** The system shall automatically version and commit generated documents to a local Git repository.
    * **AC5.2:** The system shall provide CLI commands for managing the Git repository (log, diff, revert, status, push, pull).
    * **AC5.3:**  The system shall correctly handle Git repository initialization and subsequent commits.


* **F. Multiple AI Provider Support:**
    * **AC6.1:** The system shall successfully connect and utilize Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama as specified in the configuration file.
    * **AC6.2:** The system shall handle errors gracefully when connecting to AI providers, providing informative error messages and fallback mechanisms.

**II. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **A. Performance:** The system shall generate all documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be determined based on testing and model capabilities), even for large projects.
* **B. Security:**  The system shall securely handle API keys and sensitive data, adhering to best practices.
* **C. Scalability:** The system shall handle large projects with extensive documentation without significant performance degradation.
* **D. Usability:** The CLI interface shall be intuitive and easy to use for both technical and non-technical users.
* **E. Maintainability:** The codebase shall be well-structured, documented, and easy to maintain and extend.


**III.  User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**

* **AC7.1:**  A representative sample of target users (project managers, business analysts) shall successfully use the system to generate documentation for at least three different project scenarios (small, medium, large complexity).
* **AC7.2:**  Users shall report a high level of satisfaction with the accuracy, completeness, and usability of the generated documents.  Feedback will be documented and addressed as needed.


**IV.  Deployment:**

* **AC8.1:**  The system shall be successfully deployed to npm and accessible via `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent`.


Failure to meet any of these acceptance criteria will result in rejection of the ADPA system.  A detailed test plan will be developed and executed to verify compliance with these criteria.
