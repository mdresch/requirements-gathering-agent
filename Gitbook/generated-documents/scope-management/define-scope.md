# Define Scope Process: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Define Scope process for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project. This project aims to revolutionize enterprise business analysis by automating the generation of BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, significantly reducing time and effort while ensuring high-quality, consistent deliverables.  The unique aspect of this project lies in its API-first design, leveraging AI to generate Fortune 500-grade documentation in seconds, and its focus on artistic and strategic communication in its deliverables.

## 2. Process Overview

**Key Objectives:**

* Define the project scope, including features, functionalities, and deliverables.
* Clearly articulate project boundaries and explicitly state exclusions.
* Establish comprehensive acceptance criteria for all deliverables.
* Create a robust scope baseline to manage changes effectively.
* Define the scope of the API, including supported functionalities, data formats, security measures, and error handling.
* Define the scope of documentation generation, specifying supported document types (e.g., PDF, DOCX, HTML), templates, and customization options.
* Define the scope of AI integration, specifying supported AI providers, model selection, and fallback mechanisms.

**Process Flow:**

1. **Requirements Gathering and Analysis:**  Review existing documentation (README, Requirements Documents, API Specifications), conduct stakeholder interviews (as needed), and analyze functional and non-functional requirements.
2. **Scope Statement Development:** Create a comprehensive project scope statement detailing included and excluded features, deliverables, acceptance criteria, constraints, and assumptions.
3. **Stakeholder Review and Validation:** Present the scope statement to key stakeholders (development team, product owner, business analysts, potential clients) for review and feedback.  Address any discrepancies or ambiguities.
4. **Scope Approval and Baseline Establishment:** Obtain formal approval from relevant stakeholders.  The approved scope statement becomes the project scope baseline.
5. **API Scope Definition:**  Detail the API endpoints, request/response formats (OpenAPI 3.0 specifications), authentication mechanisms (API keys, JWT), rate limiting, error handling, and logging.
6. **Documentation Generation Scope Definition:** Specify the types of documents to be generated (BABOK frameworks, PMBOK documentation, etc.), the use of templates, customization options (metadata, branding), and output formats.
7. **AI Integration Scope Definition:** Define the AI providers to be integrated (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), the specific models used, data security and privacy considerations, and fallback strategies in case of provider failures.


## 3. Inputs and Tools

**Primary Inputs:**

* Project Charter (provided)
* Project README (provided)
* Requirements Documents (PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD,  02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD, etc.)
* API Specifications (`api-specs/`)
* Stakeholder Register (implied from provided documentation)
* Enterprise Environmental Factors (implied Fortune 500 context)

**Tools and Techniques:**

* Expert Judgment (Leveraging team expertise in business analysis, API development, and AI)
* Product Analysis (Analyzing existing features and functionalities)
* Prototyping (potentially for API and UI elements)
* Requirements Traceability Matrix (to link requirements to deliverables)
* Workshops (to facilitate stakeholder consensus)


## 4. Scope Definition Activities

**Requirements Analysis:** This involves a detailed analysis of functional (what the system should do) and non-functional (performance, security, scalability) requirements.  The provided documentation serves as a primary source, but further clarification might be needed through stakeholder engagement.

**Scope Boundaries:**  The project scope includes the development and deployment of a production-ready API capable of generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks from user-provided data.  The scope explicitly excludes the development of a full-fledged user interface beyond the API documentation.  Integration with third-party systems beyond those explicitly mentioned (SharePoint, Confluence) is out of scope for the initial release.  Security compliance is a high priority and is included in the scope, particularly for API security and data handling.

**Deliverables:**  The primary deliverables are:

* A fully functional and tested RESTful API (Express.js).
* Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI 3.0 specification).
* Sample generated BABOK v3 frameworks (demonstrating functionality).
* User documentation including implementation guides and usage examples.


## 5. Project Scope Statement

**Product Scope Description:**  The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary API generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  It leverages AI to produce high-quality, consistent, and Fortune 500 grade deliverables in seconds.

**Project Deliverables:** The API, API documentation, sample outputs, and user documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  The API must meet performance benchmarks (response times, throughput), security requirements (authentication, authorization, data protection), and functional requirements (accurate framework generation, error handling).  The documentation must be clear, comprehensive, and easily understandable.

**Project Constraints:**  Timelines, budget, and available resources are key constraints.

**Assumptions:**  The availability of necessary AI APIs and dependencies.

**Project Exclusions:**  A full-featured user interface, integration with all potential third-party systems, and support for all BABOK knowledge areas beyond those demonstrated.


## 6. Validation Process

The validation process involves multiple steps:

1. **Internal Technical Review:** The development team reviews the scope statement for completeness, clarity, and feasibility.
2. **Stakeholder Review:** The scope statement is presented to stakeholders for feedback and approval.
3. **Formal Approval:**  The project sponsor formally approves the scope statement, establishing the scope baseline.


This Define Scope process ensures a clear understanding of the project's goals, boundaries, and deliverables, laying a solid foundation for successful project execution.  The iterative nature of the process allows for adjustments based on stakeholder feedback, ensuring alignment and buy-in.
