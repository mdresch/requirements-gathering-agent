# Plan Scope Management

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for managing the scope of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  This plan details the processes for defining, validating, controlling, and managing changes to the project scope, ensuring alignment with the project charter and stakeholder expectations.  The unique aspect of this project is the ADPA's own involvement in defining its scope through its AI-powered strategic business inception capabilities.  This plan accounts for this innovative approach, ensuring both human oversight and AI-driven optimization.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

The ADPA project will utilize a hybrid approach to scope management, combining traditional project management methodologies with the unique capabilities of the ADPA system itself.  This will involve:

* **Iterative Scope Refinement:**  The initial scope, defined during the AI-powered strategic business inception phase (documented in `ProjectCharter.md` and related artifacts), will be iteratively refined through feedback loops involving the development team and key stakeholders. This iterative process will leverage the ADPA's ability to analyze new information and suggest scope adjustments.

* **AI-Assisted Scope Definition:**  The ADPA will play an active role in defining the project scope by analyzing existing documentation, identifying potential requirements, and suggesting appropriate boundaries.  This will be overseen and validated by the project manager and relevant stakeholders.

* **Formal Documentation:** All scope-related decisions, including initial scope definition, refinements, and change requests, will be meticulously documented and version-controlled using the built-in VCS system (detailed in the project README).

* **Stakeholder Validation:**  Key stakeholders will be actively involved in validating the project scope at each iteration, ensuring alignment with their needs and expectations. Formal sign-off processes will be implemented for major scope changes.

* **Proactive Change Management:** A formal change request process will be established to manage and control any deviations from the agreed-upon scope.  This process will involve impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and stakeholder approval before implementing any changes.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role             | Responsibilities                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager  | Overall scope management, change request approval, stakeholder communication, risk management, final scope sign-off.                        |
| Development Team | Implementing the ADPA, providing technical feedback on scope feasibility, contributing to iterative scope refinement.                         |
| Business Analyst | Requirements gathering and analysis, assisting in scope definition, creating and maintaining scope documentation, impact assessment support. |
| Stakeholders     | Providing input on requirements and expectations, validating the scope at key milestones, initiating and reviewing change requests.       |
| ADPA System      | AI-powered analysis of project documentation, identification of potential requirements and boundaries, suggestion of scope adjustments.       |


## 4. Scope Definition Process

The scope definition process comprises several phases:

**Phase 1: AI-Driven Strategic Inception:**  This phase, already completed, utilized the ADPA to generate the initial project scope, including the business case, stakeholder register, and project charter.  (`generated-documents/core-analysis/business-case.md`, `generated-documents/stakeholder-management/stakeholder-register.md`, `generated-documents/project-charter.md`)

**Phase 2: Iterative Refinement:**  This ongoing phase involves:

1. **Requirements Gathering:**  Gathering additional requirements through stakeholder interviews, document analysis, and user feedback.
2. **Scope Documentation:**  Updating the project scope statement, WBS, and acceptance criteria based on gathered requirements and ADPA analysis.
3. **Stakeholder Review:**  Presenting the refined scope to stakeholders for review and feedback.
4. **Scope Validation:**  Obtaining formal sign-off from key stakeholders on the validated scope.

**Phase 3: Change Management:** This phase will govern all scope changes post initial validation:

1. **Change Request Submission:**  Formal submission of change requests by stakeholders or the development team.
2. **Impact Assessment:** The business analyst, in conjunction with the development team, will assess the impact of the requested change on the schedule, budget, and resources.
3. **Change Approval:** The project manager will review the impact assessment and approve or reject the change request.
4. **Scope Update:**  Approved changes will be documented and incorporated into the project scope statement and WBS.

## 5. Scope Validation and Control

**Validation Methods:**

* **Formal Reviews:** Regular reviews of the project scope statement and WBS to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* **Stakeholder Sign-off:** Obtaining formal sign-off from key stakeholders at various milestones.
* **Quality Assurance:** Utilizing the ADPA's built-in quality assurance mechanisms to validate the generated documentation against PMBOK standards.

**Control Procedures:**

* **Change Control Process:**  A formal process for managing and controlling changes to the project scope (detailed in a separate Change Management Plan).
* **Configuration Management:**  Maintaining a version-controlled repository of all project documents and artifacts.
* **Regular Monitoring:**  Regular monitoring of the project progress to identify and address any potential scope creep.

## 6.  Scope Baseline

The scope baseline will be established upon completion of Phase 2 (Iterative Refinement) and will consist of the approved project scope statement, WBS, and acceptance criteria.  This baseline will serve as the reference point for managing changes throughout the project lifecycle.  The version-controlled repository of generated documents will serve as the definitive source for the scope baseline.

## 7.  Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable and will be based on PMBOK standards and stakeholder requirements. The ADPA system will assist in defining and validating these criteria.  These criteria will be documented in the relevant sections of the generated documentation.

## 8.  Assumptions and Constraints

* **Assumption:** The ADPA system will function as expected and provide accurate insights into project scope.
* **Constraint:**  The project budget and timeline are fixed.
* **Constraint:**  Compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards is mandatory.


This Plan Scope Management document will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes to the project scope or approach.  The document will be version-controlled within the project's repository.
