# Plan Scope Management for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the scope management plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This plan details the processes, procedures, and responsibilities for defining, validating, controlling, and managing the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  The project's unique focus on AI-driven, automated generation of enterprise-grade business analysis documentation necessitates a robust scope management approach to ensure deliverables meet the high standards of Fortune 500 clients and maintain alignment with the project's innovative vision.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

This project employs a hybrid agile/waterfall approach to scope management.  The core functionality (API development and core BABOK v3 framework generation) follows a waterfall methodology, ensuring a solid foundation.  However, the iterative nature of AI model refinement and the addition of new features (e.g., PMBOK, DMBOK support) will be managed using agile principles, allowing for flexibility and adaptation based on user feedback and technological advancements.

### 2.1 Methodology:

* **Requirements-driven scope definition:**  Scope will be meticulously defined based on documented functional and non-functional requirements (detailed in [link to requirements document]).  These requirements will be prioritized based on business value and technical feasibility.
* **Iterative scope refinement process:**  Agile sprints will be utilized for iterative development and refinement of features.  Each sprint will have clearly defined scope, allowing for regular review and adjustment based on feedback and evolving needs.
* **Stakeholder-centric validation approach:**  Regular stakeholder engagement (Fortune 500 clients, internal teams) will be crucial throughout the project.  Formal reviews, demos, and feedback sessions will ensure alignment and validation of deliverables.
* **Change-controlled scope management:**  A formal change request process will be implemented to manage scope changes effectively.  All change requests will be documented, assessed for impact, prioritized, and approved by the Project Manager.

### 2.2 Key Principles:

* **Clear scope boundaries:**  The project scope will be clearly defined and documented, avoiding scope creep.  A detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be maintained and regularly updated.
* **Stakeholder alignment:**  Continuous communication and collaboration with stakeholders will ensure alignment on scope, priorities, and deliverables.
* **Documented acceptance criteria:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable, ensuring objective evaluation of success.
* **Proactive change management:**  A proactive approach to change management will minimize disruptions and ensure that changes are integrated efficiently.

## 4. Scope Definition Process

The scope definition process will involve several key activities:

### 4.1 Requirements Gathering:

1. **Stakeholder interviews:**  Conducting interviews with key stakeholders to gather requirements and understand their needs.
2. **Requirements workshops:**  Facilitating workshops to collaboratively define and refine requirements.
3. **Document analysis:**  Analyzing existing documentation (e.g., business requirements documents, regulatory guidelines) to identify relevant requirements.
4. **Prototyping sessions:**  Developing prototypes to validate requirements and gather feedback.

### 4.2 Scope Documentation:

The following documents will be used to define and manage the project scope:

* **Project Scope Statement:** A formal document defining the project's objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Clearly defined criteria for accepting each deliverable.
* **Assumptions and Constraints:**  A list of assumptions made and constraints imposed on the project.


## 5. Validation and Control

### 5.1 Validation Methods:

* **Formal deliverable reviews:**  Conducting formal reviews of deliverables to ensure they meet the defined requirements and acceptance criteria.
* **Stakeholder sign-off procedures:**  Obtaining formal sign-off from stakeholders to confirm acceptance of deliverables.
* **Quality gate assessments:**  Conducting quality gate assessments at key milestones to ensure the project is on track and meeting quality standards.

### 5.2 Control Procedures:

* **Change request workflow:**  A formal process for submitting, reviewing, approving, and implementing changes to the project scope.
* **Impact assessment process:**  Assessing the impact of proposed changes on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
* **Approval authority matrix:**  Defining the approval authority for different types of scope changes.
* **Configuration management:**  Maintaining a controlled repository of project documents and artifacts.


## 6. Scope Baseline and Change Management

Once the project scope is defined and validated, a baseline will be established.  Any changes to the baseline will be formally documented and managed through the change request process.  The change request process will include:

1. **Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit a formal change request form, detailing the proposed change, justification, and impact assessment.
2. **Review and Evaluation:** The Project Manager and relevant stakeholders review the request, assessing its impact on scope, schedule, budget, and risks.
3. **Approval or Rejection:** The Project Manager approves or rejects the change request based on the evaluation.
4. **Implementation:**  If approved, the change is implemented, and the project scope baseline is updated.
5. **Documentation:** All changes are documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.

This comprehensive scope management plan ensures the successful delivery of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, meeting the high expectations of its stakeholders and delivering on its transformative vision.
