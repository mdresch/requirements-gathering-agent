# Project Scope Statement: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Generated by:** Requirements Gathering Agent v2.1.3
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Introduction

This Project Scope Statement defines the boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation, including strategic statements, from a project's existing documentation, primarily the README file and associated project files.  This document serves as the basis for scope management and change control throughout the project lifecycle.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the ADPA project is to deliver a robust and reliable tool that significantly reduces the time and effort required to create comprehensive project documentation while ensuring adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards and best practices.  Specific objectives include:

* **Reduce documentation creation time:** Decrease the time spent on manual documentation creation by at least 75%.
* **Improve documentation accuracy:** Ensure generated documents are accurate and consistent with project information.
* **Enhance PMBOK 7.0 compliance:** Guarantee all generated documents adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Increase stakeholder alignment:** Facilitate better communication and understanding among stakeholders through clear and consistent documentation.
* **Support multiple AI providers:** Offer flexibility in choosing the underlying AI model (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
* **Implement a modular architecture:** Allow for easy expansion and integration of new document types and AI providers.


## 3. Project Deliverables

The ADPA project will deliver the following:

* **Functional ADPA Application:** A fully functional command-line interface (CLI) application capable of generating PMBOK 7.0 compliant documentation.  This includes comprehensive error handling and retry logic.
* **Comprehensive Documentation Suite:**  A suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents including, but not limited to: Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Communication Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule Network Diagram, Milestone List, and strategic documents (Purpose Statement, Company Values, Mission & Vision statements).  The exact number and types of documents are subject to change based on further analysis and stakeholder feedback.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:** A sophisticated system for managing and optimizing context for large language models (LLMs), supporting up to 90% context utilization for models like Gemini 1.5 Pro.
* **Version Control System (VCS) Integration:**  A built-in VCS for generated documents, allowing for tracking changes, versioning, and reverting to previous versions.
* **Comprehensive User Documentation:**  User manuals, tutorials, and FAQs to guide users on installation, configuration, and usage of the ADPA application.  This includes detailed instructions for each CLI command.
* **Unit and Integration Tests:**  A comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the ADPA application.


## 4. Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria for each deliverable will be defined in more detail in subsequent project documentation.  However, general acceptance criteria include:

* **Functionality:** All features specified in the requirements documentation must function as expected.
* **Performance:** The application must meet predefined performance benchmarks (response times, resource utilization).
* **Reliability:** The application must be stable and robust, with minimal errors and downtime.
* **Security:**  The application must adhere to security best practices and protect sensitive data.
* **PMBOK Compliance:** All generated documents must conform to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Usability:** The application and generated documents must be easy to use and understand.


## 5. Scope Boundaries

### 5.1 In Scope

* Development of the ADPA application, including core functionality, CLI, and VCS integration.
* Generation of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation as defined in Section 3.
* Implementation of the Enhanced Context Manager.
* Creation of comprehensive user documentation.
* Development and execution of unit and integration tests.

### 5.2 Out of Scope

* Integration with third-party project management tools (initially). This may be considered in future releases.
* Support for custom document templates beyond the PMBOK standard templates.  This may be considered in future releases.
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI). This may be considered in future releases.
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial release.  A separate support plan will be developed.
* The provision of hosting infrastructure for the ADPA application.  This is the responsibility of the deployment team.

## 6. Project Constraints

* **Technical Constraints:**  The project is constrained by the capabilities of the chosen AI providers and their APIs.  The availability of sufficient computational resources is also a constraint.
* **Resource Constraints:**  The project will adhere to the allocated budget and timeline as defined in the Project Charter.  Personnel availability and expertise will also be considered.
* **Time Constraints:** The project must be completed within the allocated timeframe.


## 7. Assumptions

* The project team has access to the necessary resources (hardware, software, personnel).
* The chosen AI providers will remain stable and reliable throughout the project duration.
* Stakeholders will actively participate in the review and approval process.
* Existing project documentation will be accurate and complete.


## 8.  Risk Management

Potential risks and mitigation strategies will be detailed in the Project Risk Management Plan.  Key risks include AI provider limitations, unforeseen technical challenges, and stakeholder availability.


## 9.  Communication Plan

A detailed communication plan will be developed to ensure effective communication among stakeholders.  This will include regular updates, feedback mechanisms, and stakeholder meetings.


This Project Scope Statement will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to the scope will be managed through a formal change control process.
