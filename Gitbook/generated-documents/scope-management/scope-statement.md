## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to deliver a production-ready API, the "ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent," capable of generating BABOK v3 compliant enterprise business analysis frameworks in seconds.  This revolutionary tool addresses the significant time and resource constraints associated with traditional requirements gathering, offering a 90% time reduction and Fortune 500 quality deliverables. The primary business value lies in automating the creation of comprehensive documentation, reducing manual effort, and ensuring consistent, accurate analysis.  The project will significantly enhance efficiency and reduce costs for large-scale enterprise projects.

## 2. Project Objectives

* **Develop and deploy a production-ready Express.js API:**  The API must be robust, scalable, and secure, adhering to industry best practices.  Measured by successful deployment to a production environment and sustained uptime of 99.9%.
* **Generate BABOK v3 compliant frameworks:** The API must accurately generate frameworks that fully comply with the BABOK v3 standard. Measured by successful validation against a BABOK v3 compliance checklist.
* **Achieve 90% time reduction in requirements gathering:**  The API's automation must demonstrably reduce the time required for requirements gathering compared to traditional methods. Measured by comparing the time taken to generate frameworks using the API versus established manual processes for comparable projects.
* **Deliver Fortune 500 quality deliverables:** The generated frameworks must meet the quality standards expected by Fortune 500 companies. Measured through a review process by subject matter experts and comparison to existing industry-standard frameworks.
* **Support multiple input formats and output formats:** The API must accept various input data formats and generate output in multiple formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).  Measured by successful testing with diverse input data and generation of all specified output formats.
