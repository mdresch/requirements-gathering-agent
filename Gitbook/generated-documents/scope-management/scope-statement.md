## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

**2.1 Project Purpose:** To develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered tool capable of generating comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation from project context, including README files, requirements documents, and other relevant project artifacts.  This includes generating technical design documents and strategic business communications.

**2.2 Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a system capable of analyzing diverse project documentation formats (markdown, JSON, etc.) within 5 seconds.
*   Generate at least 29 PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documents, including a Project Charter, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, and all associated planning artifacts.
*   Generate 10 types of technical design documents (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, API Documentation, Security Design, Performance Requirements, Integration Design, Technical Stack, Deployment Architecture, Error Handling) with professional templates.
*   Generate executive-ready strategic business documents such as Company Values and Purpose Statements.
*   Achieve a minimum of 90% accuracy in PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation for all generated documents.
*   Maintain a weekly download rate of at least 175 on NPM.
*   Achieve an average user satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars based on user feedback.
