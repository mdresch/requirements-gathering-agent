# Project Scope Statement: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis using AI and a BABOK v3 compliant framework.  This project aims to deliver a production-ready API capable of generating high-quality, Fortune 500-level business analysis deliverables within seconds.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are:

*   Develop a production-ready, scalable, and secure Express.js API adhering to API-first design principles (TypeSpec).
*   Implement BABOK v3 compliant framework generation capabilities.
*   Achieve Fortune 500-level validation through real-world scenarios.
*   Provide multi-format output (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
*   Integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) for flexible and robust functionality.
*   Implement robust error handling and comprehensive logging.
*   Develop comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

**3. Project Deliverables**

The key deliverables for this project include:

*   **Production-Ready API:** A fully functional and tested Express.js API deployed to a production environment.  This includes comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI 3.0).
*   **BABOK v3 Framework Generator:**  A module within the API capable of generating complete BABOK v3 compliant frameworks based on provided input data.
*   **Enterprise Templates:** A collection of pre-built templates for various business analysis scenarios.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation:** User documentation, developer guides, and API specifications.
*   **Test Data and Results:**  Demonstrating the API's capabilities using Fortune 500-level test data and associated results.
*   **Deployment Scripts and Procedures:**  For easy and repeatable deployment of the API.

**4. Project Scope - INCLUSIONS**

*   Development of the core API functionality.
*   Implementation of BABOK v3 framework generation.
*   Integration with specified AI providers.
*   Multi-format document generation (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
*   Comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   Security features including API key authentication and rate limiting.
*   Unit and integration testing.
*   Comprehensive documentation.

**5. Project Scope - EXCLUSIONS**

*   Integration with third-party project management tools (beyond initial scope).
*   Development of a dedicated user interface (UI) beyond API documentation.
*   Long-term support and maintenance beyond initial release (separate service contract).
*   Implementation of PMBOK and DMBOK frameworks (future phases).
*   Advanced analytics and reporting features (future phases).

**6. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete and accepted when:

*   The API passes all unit and integration tests.
*   The API successfully generates BABOK v3 compliant frameworks based on the defined test cases.
*   All deliverables are completed and meet the defined quality standards.
*   Comprehensive documentation is provided.
*   The project meets the defined budget and timeline.

**7. Project Assumptions**
