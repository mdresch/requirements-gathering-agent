# Project Scope Statement

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that automatically generates comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documentation from a project's existing documentation, including strategic business statements.

**3. Project Objectives:**

*   Automate the creation of 29+ PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents.
*   Generate executive-ready strategic business documents (e.g., Purpose Statement, Company Values).
*   Intelligently analyze and incorporate information from various project sources beyond the README (requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, etc.).
*   Provide a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) with options for customized document generation and validation.
*   Implement a modular architecture allowing for future expansion and integration with third-party tools.
*   Maintain PMBOK 7.0 compliance through automated validation and quality assessment features.
*   Implement a version control system for generated documents.
*   Support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Achieve high context utilization (up to 90%) with large language models.

**4. Project Deliverables:**

*   A fully functional command-line application (requirements-gathering-agent).
*   Comprehensive documentation, including user guides, API documentation, and architectural diagrams.
*   Automated generation of PMBOK documents including (but not limited to): Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, Cost Management Plan, Quality Management Plan, Resource Management Plan, Communication Management Plan, Procurement Management Plan, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule Network Diagram, Milestone List, and strategic business statements (Purpose Statement, Company Values, Mission & Vision, etc.).
*   A local git repository within the `generated-documents` directory for version control of generated documents.


**5. Project Boundaries:**

*   **In Scope:**  Development of the core application, CLI, document generation engine, context management system, PMBOK validation, version control system, and support for multiple AI providers.  Generation of specified PMBOK and strategic documents.
*   **Out of Scope:** Integration with external project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana).  Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).  Provision of hosting or cloud infrastructure for the application.  Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial release (except for critical bug fixes).  Creation of custom templates beyond the default PMBOK and strategic document templates.

**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful generation of all specified PMBOK and strategic documents with accurate content and proper formatting.
*   CLI functionality as defined in the user documentation.
*   Successful execution of PMBOK 7.0 validation and quality assessment features.
*   Functional version control system for generated documents.
*   Successful integration with at least two AI providers.
*   Achievement of high context utilization with large language models.
*   Positive user feedback from testing and beta programs.


**7. Assumptions:**

*   Availability of necessary AI provider APIs and sufficient API credits.
*   Access to relevant project documentation for context analysis.
*   Adequate resources (time, personnel, and budget) are allocated to complete the project.


**8. Constraints:**

*   Project timeline and budget as defined in the Project Charter.
*   Adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
*   Dependence on third-party AI provider APIs.


**9. Stakeholders:**

*   Project Manager
*   Development Team
*   Business Analysts
*   End-Users (Project Managers and Business Analysts)


**10.  Project Success Metrics:**

*   Number of weekly downloads on NPM.
*   User satisfaction scores.
*   Number of generated documents.
*   Compliance with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
*   Time saved by users compared to manual documentation creation.


This Project Scope Statement serves as a formal agreement between the project team and stakeholders, outlining the project's boundaries and objectives.  Any changes to the scope will be managed through a formal change request process.
