## Scope Management Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It adheres to PMBOK Guide standards and best practices, ensuring clear definition, controlled changes, and successful delivery of the project objectives.

**2. Project Scope Statement**

The project aims to deliver a production-ready API (using Express.js and TypeScript) that generates BABOK v3-compliant business analysis frameworks based on input data.  This includes:

* **Product Scope:**  A robust, scalable, and secure API capable of generating BABOK v3 frameworks, integrating with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), supporting various output formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML), and featuring comprehensive error handling and logging.  The API will include features for template management and job tracking.
* **Project Deliverables:**
    * Functional and fully tested API.
    * Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI specification).
    * User documentation and tutorials.
    * Deployment scripts and configuration files.
    * Test data and sample outputs.
    * A set of pre-built BABOK v3 compliant templates.
* **Project Exclusions:**  Integration with third-party project management tools (beyond initial scope), ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial release, and development of specific custom templates beyond the initial set.

**3. Scope Planning Process**

This section details the activities undertaken to define and plan the project scope.

* **Requirements Elicitation:**  The initial project requirements are drawn from the provided project documentation (README, Requirements documents). Further refinement will occur through stakeholder consultations and iterative development.
* **Requirements Analysis:**  Requirements will be analyzed for completeness, consistency, conflicts, and feasibility.  Prioritization techniques (e.g., MoSCoW method) will be employed.
* **Scope Definition:** A detailed scope statement (as outlined above) will be created, capturing all in-scope and out-of-scope items.  A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be developed to decompose the project into manageable work packages.
* **Scope Baseline:**  The approved scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary will form the project scope baseline.  This will serve as the basis for scope verification and change control.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Acceptance criteria for each deliverable will be defined, specifying the conditions that must be met for acceptance by stakeholders.  This includes functional and non-functional criteria (performance, security, etc.).

**4. Scope Definition**

This section elaborates on specific aspects of scope definition.

* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** The WBS will utilize a hierarchical structure, breaking down the project into:
    * **Level 1:**  API Development, Documentation, Testing, Deployment.
    * **Level 2:** Specific tasks within each Level 1 category (e.g., API Design, API Implementation, Unit Testing, Integration Testing, etc.).
    * **Level 3:** Sub-tasks within Level 2 work packages.
* **WBS Dictionary:**  A dictionary will be created that provides detailed descriptions, resources, timelines, and acceptance criteria for each work package in the WBS.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** An RTM will be maintained to link requirements to work packages and test cases, ensuring complete traceability and facilitating impact analysis of changes.


**5. Scope Verification and Validation**

This section details how scope verification and validation will be performed.

* **Verification:**  Formal reviews will be conducted at key milestones to ensure that the work performed conforms to the approved scope baseline. This includes code reviews, design reviews, and testing.
* **Validation:**  The completed deliverables will be validated against the acceptance criteria to ensure they meet stakeholder expectations.  User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be a crucial part of this process.
* **Inspection:**  Formal inspections will be conducted on key deliverables to verify compliance with standards and requirements.
* **Formal Acceptance:**  Formal sign-off will be obtained from stakeholders upon successful completion and validation of all deliverables.


**6. Scope Change Control**

This section describes the process for managing changes to the project scope.

* **Change Request Process:**  All scope change requests will be submitted formally through a documented process.  The request will include a description of the change, justification, impact analysis (cost, schedule, resources, risk), and proposed solution.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):** A CCB will be established, comprising key stakeholders, to review and approve or reject change requests.  The CCB will assess the impact of changes on the project and approve only justified changes.
* **Change Implementation:**  Approved changes will be incorporated into the scope baseline, WBS, and project plan.  Communication of changes to the project team and stakeholders is crucial.
* **Change Log:**  A comprehensive change log will be maintained, documenting all change requests, their status, and the impact on the project.


**7. Scope Management Tools and Techniques**

* **Tools:**  Project management software (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps), documentation tools (e.g., Confluence, Microsoft Word), communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams).
* **Techniques:**  WBS, RTM, MoSCoW prioritization, formal reviews, UAT, change control meetings, regular stakeholder communication.


**8. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for scope management.
* **Business Analyst:** Requirements gathering, analysis, and documentation.
* **Development Team:**  API design, development, testing.
* **Testing Team:**  Test planning, execution, and reporting.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):**  Reviews and approves scope changes.


**9.  Scope Performance Measurement**

* **Metrics:**  Earned Value Management (EVM) to track scope progress, change request volume and approval rate, defect density, and stakeholder satisfaction.
* **Reporting:**  Regular progress reports (weekly and monthly) will track scope performance against the baseline and identify any deviations requiring attention.


**10.  Contingency Planning**

A contingency plan will be developed to address potential risks that may impact the project scope, including resource constraints, technology issues, and changing requirements.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes and ensure its continued effectiveness.  The project team will adhere to the defined processes to minimize scope creep and deliver the project successfully.
