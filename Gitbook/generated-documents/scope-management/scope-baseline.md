# Scope Baseline: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope baseline for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It serves as the foundation for managing and controlling the project scope throughout its lifecycle.  The project's unique value proposition lies in its ability to generate enterprise-grade, BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks in seconds, leveraging AI and an API-first architecture. This baseline encompasses the approved project scope statement, work breakdown structure (WBS), and a WBS dictionary.

## 2. Project Scope Statement

### 2.1 Product Scope:

The primary deliverable is a production-ready Express.js API that generates BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks based on user-provided input data.  Key features include:

* **Real-time framework generation:**  Instant creation of comprehensive BABOK frameworks.
* **Multi-format output:** Generation of deliverables in PDF, DOCX, and HTML formats.
* **Stakeholder ecosystem mapping:** AI-powered analysis of complex organizational structures.
* **Regulatory compliance integration:** Automatic incorporation of relevant regulations (e.g., Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* **Enterprise-grade security:** Robust authentication, authorization, and error handling.
* **Scalable architecture:** Designed for efficient handling of large datasets and high-volume requests.
* **API-first design:**  Utilizing OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for clear documentation and interoperability.


### 2.2 Project Scope:

The project encompasses all activities necessary to design, develop, test, deploy, and document the API, including:

* **Requirements gathering and analysis:** Defining functional and non-functional requirements.
* **API design and development:**  Implementing the API using Express.js, TypeScript, and relevant libraries.
* **Unit and integration testing:** Ensuring the API's functionality and performance.
* **Deployment and infrastructure setup:** Deploying the API to a production environment.
* **Documentation creation:** Generating comprehensive API documentation and user guides.
* **Security implementation:** Integrating security measures to protect the API and user data.
* **Quality assurance:** Implementing a robust quality assurance process to ensure the API meets quality standards.


### 2.3 Acceptance Criteria:

The API will be considered complete and accepted when:

* All defined functional and non-functional requirements are met.
* Unit and integration tests pass successfully.
* The API is deployed to a production environment and is accessible.
* Comprehensive documentation is available.
* Security vulnerabilities are mitigated.
* The API demonstrates successful generation of BABOK v3 compliant frameworks in under 2 seconds for Fortune 500-scale datasets.
* Stakeholder sign-off is obtained.

## 4. WBS Dictionary

(This section would contain a detailed description of each work package listed in the WBS, including assigned resources, timelines, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.  Due to the length constraints, this is omitted here but would be a crucial part of a complete Scope Baseline document.)


## 5. Baseline Control

Changes to the scope baseline will be managed through a formal change control process, including impact assessment, approval by stakeholders, and updates to the project documentation.  Regular reviews will ensure that the project remains on track and within scope.


## 6. Verification and Validation

Verification activities will ensure that the deliverables meet the defined requirements and specifications. Validation activities will confirm that the deliverables meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  This will include rigorous testing, code reviews, and stakeholder sign-off.


## 7. Baseline Maintenance

The scope baseline will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, with updates documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.  Regular reviews and audits will ensure its continued relevance and accuracy.  Any changes will be documented and approved per the change control process.
