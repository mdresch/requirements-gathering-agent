# Requirements Documentation: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:**  Bard (AI-assisted)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive project management documentation based on project context, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This document details both functional and non-functional requirements, considering the project's current state and future development goals.


## 2. Goals

The primary goals of ADPA are to:

* **Automate Documentation:** Significantly reduce the time and effort required to create project documentation.
* **Improve Accuracy:** Minimize errors and inconsistencies in project documentation.
* **Ensure Compliance:** Generate documentation that fully complies with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Enhance Understanding:** Create clear, concise, and easily accessible project documentation for all stakeholders.
* **Enable Strategic Planning:** Facilitate strategic project initiation and communication through AI-powered analysis and document generation.


## 3. System Overview

ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) tool built using Node.js and TypeScript. It leverages large language models (LLMs) from various providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to process project context and generate documents.  A key feature is its Enhanced Context Manager, which optimizes context utilization for different LLMs to maximize accuracy.  The system also includes built-in version control for generated documents and a modular architecture to allow for future expansion.


## 4. Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements

These requirements describe the specific functionalities that ADPA must perform:

* **Context Analysis:**
    * Automatically discover and analyze all relevant project documentation (README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information, etc.).
    * Score and prioritize discovered files based on relevance to PMBOK 7.0 concepts (0-100 score).
    * Categorize discovered files into meaningful categories (Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other).
    * Identify and suggest the most valuable source files for manual review.

* **Document Generation:**
    * Generate a complete suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc.).
    * Generate executive-ready strategic documents (Purpose Statement, Company Values, Mission & Vision statements).
    * Support multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML).
    * Allow users to specify which document types to generate.
    * Implement a modular processor architecture enabling easy addition of new document types.
    * Support a built-in version control system for generated documents (Git integration, history, diffs, revert).

* **Validation & Quality Assurance:**
    * Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
    * Assess the quality of generated documents (structure, content, terminology).
    * Ensure cross-document consistency.
    * Provide detailed quality scores and recommendations for improvement.

* **AI Provider Integration:**
    * Integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
    * Allow users to select their preferred AI provider through configuration or an interactive CLI menu.
    * Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms for AI provider failures.
    * Securely manage API keys and authentication credentials.

* **User Interface:**
    * Provide a clear and user-friendly command-line interface.
    * Offer detailed help and usage instructions.
    * Provide comprehensive logging and progress reporting.

* **Configuration:**
    * Allow users to configure various settings through a `.env` file or command-line arguments.
    * Support for configuring API keys, output directory, AI provider, and other options.


### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements

These requirements describe the quality attributes of ADPA:

* **Performance:** The system should generate documents efficiently, minimizing processing time.
* **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle projects of varying sizes and complexity.
* **Reliability:** The system should be robust and reliable, with minimal downtime and error handling.
* **Security:** The system should securely manage API keys and protect sensitive project data.
* **Maintainability:** The system should be designed for easy maintenance and updates.
* **Usability:** The system should be easy to use and understand, even for users with limited technical expertise.
* **Portability:** The system should be easily deployable across different operating systems.


## 5. Future Considerations

* **Advanced Context Analysis:**  Implement more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) techniques to better understand project context.
* **Enhanced AI Capabilities:** Integrate with more advanced LLMs offering improved performance and capabilities.
* **Integration with PM Tools:** Integrate with popular project management tools (Jira, Asana, etc.).
* **Collaboration Features:**  Allow for collaborative document editing and review.
* **Customizable Templates:** Allow users to create and customize their own document templates.


## 6. Acceptance Criteria

The system will be considered complete and accepted when:

* All functional requirements are implemented and fully tested.
* All non-functional requirements are met.
* The system generates accurate and PMBOK 7.0 compliant documentation.
* User acceptance testing (UAT) is successfully completed.


This document serves as a living document and will be updated as the project evolves.  Any changes will be documented and communicated to stakeholders.
