# Requirements Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management process for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool that generates PMBOK-compliant project documentation from a project's README and associated files. This plan details how requirements will be elicited, analyzed, documented, traced, and managed throughout the project lifecycle.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goal of ADPA is to automate the creation of comprehensive, accurate, and PMBOK-compliant project management documentation.  Specific objectives include:

*   Generating a complete suite of PMBOK documents (29+ documents).
*   Supporting multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Implementing a robust context management system for optimal AI performance.
*   Ensuring PMBOK 7.0 compliance through rigorous validation.
*   Providing a user-friendly command-line interface.
*   Maintaining a version control system for generated documents.
*   Creating a modular architecture for easy extensibility.

**3. Stakeholder Identification and Analysis**

Key stakeholders include:

*   **Project Sponsor:**  [Name/Role] – Responsible for project authorization and funding.
*   **Project Manager:** [Name/Role] – Responsible for overall project execution.
*   **Development Team:** [Names/Roles] – Responsible for software development and maintenance.
*   **End-Users:** Project managers, business analysts, and other professionals requiring project documentation.

A detailed stakeholder register, including communication plans, is maintained separately.

**4. Requirements Elicitation Techniques**

The following techniques will be used to elicit requirements:

*   **Analysis of Project README and Documentation:**  ADPA will leverage the project's existing documentation (README, architecture documents, etc.) to derive initial requirements.
*   **User Stories:** User stories will be used to capture functional requirements from the end-user perspective.
*   **Use Cases:**  Use cases will supplement user stories, providing more detailed scenarios for specific functionalities.
*   **Interviews & Feedback:**  Regular feedback sessions with end-users will ensure alignment with user needs and identify potential gaps.
*   **Prototyping & Testing:**  Prototypes will be developed and tested to validate requirements and identify usability issues.

**5. Requirements Analysis and Documentation**

Requirements will be documented using a combination of techniques:

*   **User Stories:**  Formatted as "As a [role], I want [goal] so that [benefit]".
*   **Use Cases:**  Detailed descriptions of interactions between the user and the system.
*   **Functional Requirements:**  Specific functionalities the system must perform.
*   **Non-Functional Requirements:**  Performance, security, usability, and other quality attributes.
*   **Constraints:**  Limitations and restrictions imposed on the system.
*   **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  A matrix linking requirements to design, implementation, and test cases.  This will ensure requirements are fully addressed and changes are tracked.

All requirements will be stored in a central repository (Git) for version control and accessibility.

**6. Requirements Prioritization**

Requirements will be prioritized using the MoSCoW method:

*   **Must have:** Critical requirements for core functionality.
*   **Should have:** Important requirements that enhance functionality.
*   **Could have:** Desirable requirements that may be implemented later.
*   **Won't have:** Requirements that will not be implemented in this iteration.

This prioritization will guide development efforts and ensure focus on the most critical features.

**7. Requirements Traceability**

A comprehensive requirements traceability matrix will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle.  This matrix will link requirements to design specifications, implementation code, and test cases.  This will enable effective change management and ensure all requirements are addressed.

**8. Requirements Change Management**

A formal change management process will be implemented to handle any changes to requirements.  All change requests will be documented, evaluated, and approved by the appropriate stakeholders before implementation. The impact of changes on other requirements and the project schedule will be carefully assessed.

**9. Requirements Validation and Verification**

Requirements will be validated through reviews with stakeholders and verified through testing.  Validation ensures the requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs, while verification ensures the system meets the specified requirements.  Formal acceptance testing with end-users will be conducted to ensure the system meets their expectations.

**10. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used for requirements management:

*   **Git:** For version control of requirements documents.
*   **Jira or similar issue tracker:** For managing requirements, bugs, and tasks.
*   **Confluence or similar wiki:** For collaborative documentation.
*   **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  Spreadsheet or dedicated tool for tracking requirements.

**11. Roles and Responsibilities**

*   **Requirements Analyst:** Responsible for eliciting, analyzing, and documenting requirements.
*   **Development Team:** Responsible for implementing and testing the system to meet requirements.
*   **Project Manager:** Responsible for overseeing the requirements management process and ensuring adherence to the plan.
*   **Stakeholders:** Responsible for reviewing and approving requirements.


**12. Acceptance Criteria**

The ADPA project will be considered successfully completed when:

*   All must-have and should-have requirements are met.
*   The system generates PMBOK-compliant documentation with high accuracy.
*   The system is user-friendly and easy to use.
*   The system is thoroughly tested and meets performance requirements.
*   The system successfully integrates with multiple AI providers.
*   Formal acceptance testing is completed successfully by end-users.


This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect project progress and any changes to requirements.  This ensures a well-defined and controlled process for managing the requirements throughout the ADPA project lifecycle.
