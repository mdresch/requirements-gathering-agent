### Risk Assessment Matrix

The following matrix assesses the probability and impact of each identified risk.  Probability is rated as High (H - 70-100%), Medium (M - 30-70%), or Low (L - 0-30%). Impact is rated on a scale of 1-5 (1=Low, 5=High). Risk Score is calculated as Probability (%) √ó Impact.  Risk Priority is determined based on the Risk Score.

### Risk Response Planning

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies and Contingency Plans

The following table outlines mitigation strategies and contingency plans for high-priority risks.

| Risk ID | Mitigation Strategy                                                                  | Contingency Plan                                                                        |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TR-01   | Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms in the application.          | Use alternative AI providers (Google AI, Ollama) if Azure OpenAI is unavailable.      |
| TR-03   | Thoroughly test integrations with all supported AI providers during development.  | Develop fallback mechanisms for unavailable providers.                               |
| PM-01   | Establish clear milestones and checkpoints with regular progress reviews.         | Adjust project schedule based on progress and identify bottlenecks early.             |
| PM-03   | Develop a detailed budget with contingency reserves for unexpected costs.          | Secure additional funding if necessary.                                              |
| PM-04   | Implement a formal change management process for scope changes.                    | Conduct thorough impact assessments for all proposed changes.                          |
| BR-03   | Gather regular user feedback throughout development and address concerns promptly. | Develop a detailed communication plan to manage stakeholder expectations.              |


#### Risk Transfer Strategies

* **Insurance:** Explore insurance options to cover potential financial losses due to unforeseen events (e.g., data breaches).
* **Contracts:** Utilize clear contracts with third-party vendors to define responsibilities and liabilities.


#### Risk Acceptance

Low-priority risks (e.g., BR-01, BR-04) will be accepted and monitored closely.


### Risk Monitoring & Control

* **Risk Register:** A centralized risk register will be maintained, updated regularly, and reviewed at each project milestone.
* **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):**  KRIs will include API error rates, development progress against schedule, budget burn-down, and user feedback scores.
* **Risk Review Meetings:** Regular risk review meetings will be conducted to assess the status of identified risks and adjust response plans as needed.
* **Communication Protocol:**  A clear communication protocol will ensure timely notification of risk events to relevant stakeholders.


This Risk Analysis provides a proactive approach to managing potential project challenges.  Regular monitoring and adjustments to the risk response plan will be crucial for successful project completion.  This document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.
