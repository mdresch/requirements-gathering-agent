### 1. Risk Identification

This section identifies potential risks that could impact the successful completion of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Risks are categorized for clarity and analysis.


#### 1.1 Technical Risks

|---|---|---|---|
| TR-01 | Azure OpenAI API unavailability or performance degradation | Technical | API outages, increased latency, rate limits exceeded |
| TR-02 | Integration issues with alternative AI providers (Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) | Technical | API incompatibility, authentication failures, differing model capabilities |
| TR-03 | Inaccurate or inconsistent document generation due to limitations of AI models | Technical | Ambiguous input, insufficient context, model hallucinations |
| TR-04 | Difficulty in maintaining cross-document consistency across multiple generated documents | Technical | Complex relationships between documents, changes to templates |
| TR-05 | Security vulnerabilities in the application or API integrations | Technical | Unpatched dependencies, insecure coding practices, insufficient authentication |
| TR-06 | Scalability issues handling large projects with extensive documentation | Technical | High volume of input files, long processing times, resource constraints |


#### 1.2 Project Management Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Risk Category | Risk Triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| PM-01 | Delays in project milestones due to unforeseen technical challenges | Project Management | Complex integrations, debugging, unexpected API limitations |
| PM-02 | Insufficient resources (developers, testers) to complete the project on time | Project Management | High attrition, difficulty recruiting, competing priorities |
| PM-03 | Budget overrun due to unexpected costs (e.g., cloud computing, AI API usage) | Project Management | Increased API usage, unforeseen development complexities, underestimated effort |
| PM-04 | Scope creep due to evolving stakeholder requirements or feature requests | Project Management |  Unclear requirements, late requests, changing priorities |
| PM-05 | Communication breakdowns between development team and stakeholders | Project Management | Inadequate communication channels, lack of clarity, insufficient feedback loops |


#### 1.3 Business Risks

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Risk Category | Risk Triggers |
|---|---|---|---|
| BR-01 | Low market adoption of the tool due to lack of awareness or competition | Business | Weak marketing, strong competition, limited perceived value |
| BR-02 | Negative customer feedback or reviews impacting reputation and adoption | Business | Bugs, poor performance, unmet expectations |
| BR-03 | Changes in AI provider pricing or API terms affecting profitability | Business | Provider price increases, changes in API access |
| BR-04 | Regulatory changes impacting data privacy or AI usage | Business | New data protection laws, restrictions on AI applications |


### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

This matrix assesses the probability and impact of each identified risk.

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Risk Category | Risk Triggers | Probability (%) | Impact (1-5) | Risk Score | Risk Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TR-01 | Azure OpenAI API unavailability | Technical | API outages | 5 | 4 | 20 | High |
| TR-02 | Integration issues with alternative AI providers | Technical | API incompatibility | 15 | 3 | 45 | High |
| TR-03 | Inaccurate document generation | Technical | Model limitations | 20 | 3 | 60 | Critical |
| TR-04 | Difficulty maintaining cross-document consistency | Technical | Complex relationships | 10 | 2 | 20 | Medium |
| TR-05 | Security vulnerabilities | Technical | Unpatched dependencies | 5 | 5 | 25 | High |
| TR-06 | Scalability issues | Technical | Large projects | 10 | 3 | 30 | High |
| PM-01 | Milestone delays | Project Management | Technical challenges | 25 | 4 | 100 | Critical |
| PM-02 | Resource insufficiency | Project Management | High attrition | 15 | 3 | 45 | High |
| PM-03 | Budget overrun | Project Management | Increased API usage | 20 | 4 | 80 | Critical |
| PM-04 | Scope creep | Project Management | Unclear requirements | 30 | 3 | 90 | Critical |
| PM-05 | Communication breakdowns | Project Management | Inadequate channels | 10 | 2 | 20 | Medium |
| BR-01 | Low market adoption | Business | Weak marketing | 25 | 4 | 100 | Critical |
| BR-02 | Negative customer feedback | Business | Bugs, poor performance | 15 | 3 | 45 | High |
| BR-03 | Changes in AI provider pricing | Business | Provider price changes | 10 | 3 | 30 | High |
| BR-04 | Regulatory changes | Business | New data protection laws | 5 | 4 | 20 | High |


**Note:** Probability is estimated as a percentage, and Impact is rated on a scale of 1 (Low) to 5 (High).  Risk Score is the product of Probability and Impact. Risk Priority is assigned based on the Risk Score.


### 3. Risk Response Planning

This section outlines mitigation strategies and contingency plans for the identified high-priority risks.

**Risk ID: TR-03 (Inaccurate document generation)**

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement rigorous testing and validation procedures, including manual review of generated documents by subject matter experts.  Incorporate feedback mechanisms to improve model accuracy over time.
* **Contingency Plan:** If significant inaccuracies persist, allocate additional resources to manual document editing and quality assurance.


**Risk ID: PM-01 (Milestone delays)**

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Agile methodologies with frequent sprint reviews and adjustments.  Establish clear communication channels and escalation procedures.
* **Contingency Plan:** If critical milestones are missed, re-evaluate the project schedule and resource allocation, potentially adjusting scope or timeline.


**Risk ID: PM-03 (Budget overrun)**

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Closely monitor cloud computing and API usage costs.  Implement cost-saving measures where possible (e.g., optimize API calls, utilize cheaper AI models).
* **Contingency Plan:** If budget constraints become critical, explore options such as securing additional funding or reducing project scope.


**Risk ID: PM-04 (Scope creep)**

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Establish a formal change management process for handling stakeholder requests.  Maintain a clear and well-defined project scope statement.
* **Contingency Plan:** If scope creep becomes unmanageable, implement a formal change control board to prioritize and approve changes.


**Risk ID: BR-01 (Low market adoption)**

* **Mitigation Strategy:**  Develop a comprehensive marketing and outreach plan, targeting key stakeholders through various channels.  Build a strong online presence and engage with the community.
* **Contingency Plan:** If adoption remains low, explore alternative monetization strategies or partnerships to increase market reach.


**Other Risks:**  Mitigation strategies and contingency plans will be developed for the remaining risks based on their priority and potential impact.  These will be documented in the project risk register.


### 4. Risk Monitoring & Control

* **Risk Register:** A central repository will track all identified risks, their assessments, response plans, and status. This register will be updated regularly.
* **Risk Review Meetings:** Regular meetings (e.g., weekly) will be conducted to review the risk register, assess the status of risks, and adjust response plans as needed.
* **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs):**  Key performance indicators (KPIs) will be monitored to detect potential risk triggers early. Examples include API error rates, document generation times, customer feedback ratings, and budget burn-down rates.
* **Communication Protocol:**  A clear communication protocol will be established to ensure timely notification of risk events and facilitate effective response.


This Risk Analysis document will be reviewed and updated throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in the project environment and risk landscape.  This is a living document, subject to revision based on ongoing monitoring and evaluation.
