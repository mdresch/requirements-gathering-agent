**Description:** Comprehensive technology stack recommendations

---

Based on the detailed project context for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** — an AI-powered requirements gathering and PMBOK documentation generation tool with multi-provider AI support and enterprise-grade features — here is a comprehensive technology stack analysis and recommendation:

---

## 1. Core Platform & Language

### Node.js + TypeScript
- **Rationale:**  
  The project is implemented in Node.js with TypeScript, which provides:
  - Strong typing and maintainability for complex business logic and AI integration.
  - Native ES modules support (Node.js 18+ recommended).
  - Rich ecosystem for AI SDKs, cloud integrations, CLI tooling, and file system operations.
- **Recommendation:**  
  Use Node.js 18+ with TypeScript 5.0+ for full compatibility with ES modules and latest language features.

---

## 2. AI Provider Integration

### Multi-Provider AI Support
- **Supported Providers:**
  - Azure OpenAI (with Entra ID or API key authentication)
  - GitHub AI Models (Codespaces & Actions integration)
  - Ollama (Local AI for offline development)
  - Azure AI Studio (Enterprise managed services)
- **Rationale:**
  - Enables flexibility and enterprise-grade security (Azure Entra ID).
  - Local AI support (Ollama) reduces cloud costs and supports offline dev.
  - GitHub AI models provide CI/CD integrated AI capabilities.
- **Recommendation:**
  - For production, prioritize **Azure OpenAI with Entra ID** for security & scalability.
  - Use **local Ollama** during development to reduce costs and enable offline scenarios.
  - Implement robust fallback and provider priority logic.
- **SDKs/Libraries:**
  - `@azure/openai`, `@azure/identity`, `@azure-rest/ai-inference` for Azure integration.
  - GitHub APIs for GitHub AI.
  - Ollama CLI or HTTP client for local inference.

---

## 3. Architecture & Design

### Modular, Extensible Architecture
- **Rationale:**
  - Modular services for strategic planning, PMBOK docs generation, analysis, and AI provider abstraction.
  - Supports plug-and-play of AI providers with fallback.
  - Easy to extend for new document types or AI models.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Design clear interfaces for AI provider clients.
  - Separate concerns: input processing, AI prompt management, output parsing, and file generation.
  - Use dependency injection or factory patterns for AI provider selection.

---

## 4. Documentation Generation

### PMBOK-Aligned Document Generation
- **Rationale:**
  - Full coverage of Initiating and Planning process groups with detailed management plans and artifacts.
  - Enforces strict JSON output for easy parsing and integration.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Use structured prompt engineering to enforce JSON schema outputs.
  - Implement validation and error handling on AI responses.
  - Support large-context LLMs (e.g., GPT-4-32k) for long documents.
  - Provide CLI and programmatic API for flexible usage.

---

## 5. CLI & Automation

- **Rationale:**
  - Supports direct document generation via CLI for automation and integration into pipelines.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Use `commander.js` or similar for CLI commands.
  - Support environment-driven configuration for AI providers.
  - Provide scripts for bulk generation, caching, and output formatting.

---

## 6. Frontend & UI/UX (Optional)

- While the core package is backend/CLI focused, UI/UX considerations are mentioned.
- If a web UI is planned:
  - Use **React** + **Next.js** or similar framework for server-side rendering and API routes.
  - Provide interactive dashboards for strategic planning and document review.
  - Integrate with AI APIs via REST or GraphQL.

---

## 7. Security & Compliance

- **Enterprise-Grade Security:**
  - Use **Azure Entra ID (Azure AD)** for authentication and role-based access control.
  - Secure storage of API keys and tokens via environment variables or Azure Key Vault.
- **Compliance:**
  - Embed regulatory compliance checks in generated documents.
  - Ensure data privacy, especially if handling sensitive project info.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Implement auditing/logging of AI calls.
  - Follow Microsoft security best practices for cloud and local deployments.

---

## 8. DevOps & Deployment

- **Environments:**
  - Support local dev with Ollama and test AI providers.
  - Production deployment on Azure or similar cloud for scalability.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated builds and document generation pipelines.
- **Containerization:**
  - Package as Docker container for consistent deployment.
- **Recommendation:**
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/ARM templates) for Azure resources.
  - Automate environment setup for developers.

---

## 9. Data Storage & Persistence

- The project focuses on document generation rather than persistent storage.
- If needed:
  - Use cloud blob storage (Azure Blob Storage) or databases (Cosmos DB, PostgreSQL) for saving generated docs and project metadata.
- Recommendation:
  - Provide integration points for third-party document management or version control systems.

---

## 10. Logging, Monitoring & Error Handling

- Implement centralized logging (e.g., Azure Monitor, Application Insights).
- Robust error handling especially for AI response validation and network failures.
- Provide retry mechanisms and alerting on AI provider failures.
