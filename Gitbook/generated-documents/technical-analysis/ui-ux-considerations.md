**Description:** User experience and interface design recommendations

---

The "Requirements Gathering Agent" project is a developer-focused CLI tool that leverages AI to generate PMBOK-compliant project documentation from README files. Given this context—a technical user base, command line interface, and document generation output—here are detailed UX/UI recommendations to enhance user experience:

---

### 1. **Onboarding & Discoverability**

- **Interactive CLI Wizard:**  
  Provide an optional interactive mode that guides users step-by-step through configuration, choosing AI providers, and selecting which documents to generate. This reduces friction for new users unfamiliar with flags or environment variables.

- **Clear Getting Started Guide:**  
  While the README is comprehensive, consider having a dedicated `docs/getting-started.md` with screenshots (for related UI, e.g., Azure portal) or animated CLI walkthroughs demonstrating common workflows.

- **Example Projects:**  
  Include sample README files or demo projects that users can test the tool on immediately after installation.

---

### 2. **Command Line Interface (CLI) Usability**

- **Command Feedback & Progress Indicators:**  
  Since document generation (especially with AI calls) can take time, provide clear progress bars or spinners with descriptive updates (e.g., “Generating Risk Management Plan...”).

- **Verbose & Quiet Modes:**  
  Allow toggling between detailed logs for troubleshooting (`--verbose`) and minimal output (`--quiet`) for users who prefer less clutter.

- **Error Messages & Recovery:**  
  Errors should be human-readable and actionable. For example, if authentication fails, the CLI should suggest checking `.env` settings or running `az login`.

- **Command Autocomplete Support:**  
  Provide shell completion scripts for bash, zsh, and PowerShell to facilitate faster command usage.

- **Preset Profiles:**  
  Allow saving user configurations (AI provider, document sets) as named profiles for quick reuse.

---

### 3. **Configuration Management**

- **Configuration Validation:**  
  On startup, validate `.env` and config flags, warning users of missing or inconsistent settings before processing.

- **Config File Support Beyond `.env`:**  
  Support additional config formats like `requirements-agent.config.json/yaml` for more complex setups, enabling easier version control and sharing.

- **Secrets Handling Guidance:**  
  Provide explicit UX copy on how to securely manage tokens and keys, emphasizing not to commit them to public repos.

---

### 4. **Output & Documentation Structure**

- **Output Summary Report:**  
  After generation, display a summary of created documents with their paths, and optionally open the master index (`README.md`) automatically.

- **Document Preview Option:**  
  Offer a CLI flag to preview any generated document in the terminal or open it in the default editor.

- **Customizable Output Location:**  
  Allow users to specify an output directory instead of always writing to `generated-documents/`.

---

### 5. **Accessibility & Inclusivity**

- Though CLI-based, ensure color schemes and text formatting in terminal output meet accessibility standards (contrast, color blindness safe palettes).

- Provide clear, concise language avoiding overly technical jargon where possible, or link to explanations.

---

### 6. **Integration & Extensibility**

- **IDE Integration:**  
  Consider developing extensions/plugins for popular IDEs (VS Code) to run commands and view generated documents directly within the editor.

- **API or Library Mode:**  
  Beyond CLI, expose the core functionality as an importable library with well-documented functions for integration into other tools or UIs.

---

### 7. **User Support & Community**

- **In-CLI Help & Tips:**  
  Display helpful tips or links to docs/support channels on errors or common commands.

- **Feedback Collection:**  
  Provide a simple way for users to submit feedback or report issues directly from the CLI.

---

### 8. **UI/UX Considerations for Future GUI**

If there is a plan to build a graphical user interface later:

- **Dashboard Overview:**  
  Show project status, generated documents, AI usage stats, and error logs in a clean dashboard.

- **Document Editor & Collaboration:**  
  Integrate live editing with commenting and version control hooks.

- **Authentication Flows:**  
  Simplify Azure OpenAI and GitHub token management with OAuth flows.
