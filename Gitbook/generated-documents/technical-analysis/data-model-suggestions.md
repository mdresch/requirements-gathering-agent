## Data Model for Requirements Gathering Agent

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) processes a significant amount of data, including project metadata, discovered files, AI model interactions, and generated documents.  A hybrid approach, leveraging both relational and NoSQL databases, is recommended for optimal scalability and performance.

**I. Relational Database (PostgreSQL Recommended):**  This will store structured data requiring ACID properties and complex relationships.

**A. Core Entities:**

1. **Projects:**
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `name` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `description` (TEXT)
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `repository_url` (VARCHAR(255), NULLABLE)  // For version control integration
    * `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Users)

2. **Users:**
    * `user_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)
    * `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)
    * `api_keys` (JSONB) // Store API keys for different providers securely.  Consider encryption at rest.

3. **Files:**
    * `file_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `path` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `filename` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `content` (TEXT) // Store file content. Consider large object storage for very large files.
    * `relevance_score` (FLOAT)
    * `category` (ENUM: 'Primary', 'Planning', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Other')
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `md5_hash` (VARCHAR(32), UNIQUE) // For deduplication

4. **Documents:**
    * `document_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects)
    * `document_type` (VARCHAR(255)) // e.g., 'Project Charter', 'Risk Management Plan'
    * `content` (TEXT) // Store generated document content. Consider large object storage for large documents.
    * `generated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `provider` (VARCHAR(255)) // e.g., 'Azure OpenAI', 'Google Gemini'
    * `model` (VARCHAR(255)) // e.g., 'gpt-4', 'gemini-pro'
    * `quality_score` (FLOAT)
    * `pmbok_compliance_score` (FLOAT)
    * `version` (INT) // For version control

5. **DocumentVersions:** (for VCS integration)
    * `version_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY)
    * `document_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Documents)
    * `content` (TEXT) //Store document content for each version.  Consider large object storage.
    * `commit_hash` (VARCHAR(40)) // Git commit hash
    * `created_at` (TIMESTAMP)


**B. Relationships:**

* One-to-many relationship between Projects and Files.
* One-to-many relationship between Projects and Documents.
* One-to-many relationship between Documents and DocumentVersions.
* One-to-many relationship between Users and Projects.

**C. Indexes:**

* Index `project_id` in `Files` and `Documents` tables.
* Index `document_type` in `Documents` table.
* Index `filename` and `md5_hash` in `Files` table.
* Index `commit_hash` in `DocumentVersions` table.


**D. Constraints:**

* Ensure data integrity through appropriate foreign key constraints and NOT NULL constraints on relevant fields.
* Use CHECK constraints to enforce data type and range limitations (e.g., relevance_score between 0 and 100).


**E. Normalization:** The model is largely in 3NF. Further normalization might be considered if needed based on future expansion.


**II. NoSQL Database (MongoDB Recommended):** This will handle semi-structured data and large-scale text data efficiently.

**A. Collections:**

1. **Context:**  Store the processed context used for document generation.  This will be a JSON document containing the extracted and prioritized information from multiple files.  Consider using embeddings for efficient similarity search and context retrieval.

2. **API Logs:**  Record API calls to AI providers, including request parameters, response data, and timestamps for debugging and performance analysis.

3. **Analysis Logs:**  Store details of the project analysis, including file discovery, relevance scoring, and context building steps.


**III. Database Technology Recommendations:**

* **Relational:** PostgreSQL offers excellent performance, scalability, and robust features, making it ideal for managing structured data with complex relationships.
* **NoSQL:** MongoDB's flexibility and scalability are well-suited for handling semi-structured data, such as large text contexts and API logs.


**IV. Scalability and Performance Considerations:**

* **Sharding:** For very large datasets, consider sharding the relational database across multiple servers.
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (Redis) to reduce database load and improve response times.
* **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle document generation asynchronously, improving responsiveness and scalability.
* **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple database servers using a load balancer.
* **Large Object Storage:** Use cloud storage services (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) to store large file contents and generated documents outside the main database.


**V. Data Security and Privacy Recommendations:**

* **Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Encrypt sensitive data, including API keys and user data, both when stored in the database and when transmitted over the network.
* **Access Control:** Implement robust access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data based on user roles and permissions.
* **Data Masking:** Mask sensitive data in logs and reports to protect user privacy.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Compliance with Regulations:** Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA).
