**Description:** Database architecture and data model recommendations

---

The `requirements-gathering-agent` generates a variety of PMBOK-compliant documents.  A robust data model needs to accommodate the diverse information generated, as well as the configuration and operational aspects of the tool itself.  I propose a multi-model approach, leveraging relational and potentially NoSQL databases depending on specific needs.


**I. Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):  For structured data.**

This database will primarily manage the metadata about generated documents, projects, and user configurations.

* **Projects Table:**
    * `project_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `project_name` (VARCHAR(255))
    * `readme_path` (VARCHAR(255))  // Path to the input README file
    * `creation_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `user_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Users table)
    * `ai_provider` (VARCHAR(50)) // Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama
    * `status` (ENUM('pending', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'failed'))
    * `error_message` (TEXT) // Store error messages if generation fails

* **Documents Table:**
    * `document_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects table)
    * `document_type` (VARCHAR(255)) // e.g., 'Project Summary', 'Risk Management Plan', 'WBS'
    * `document_path` (VARCHAR(255)) // Path to the generated document
    * `generation_timestamp` (TIMESTAMP)
    * `status` (ENUM('pending', 'generated', 'failed'))
    * `error_message` (TEXT)

* **Users Table:** (Optional, if user accounts are implemented)
    * `user_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `username` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)
    * `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255)) // Securely stored password hash
    * `email` (VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE)


* **Configuration Table:**
    * `config_id` (INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT)
    * `project_id` (INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing Projects table)
    * `key` (VARCHAR(255)) // Configuration parameter name (e.g., 'AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT')
    * `value` (TEXT) // Configuration parameter value


**II. NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB): For semi-structured or unstructured data (Optional).**

This could be used to store the actual content of generated documents if you anticipate needing to perform complex text analysis or searches on the generated content.  However, this is less critical if the primary use case is document generation and retrieval.  If used:

* A collection for each document type, storing the generated text as a JSON document.  This allows for flexible schema and easy handling of different document structures.  The `document_id` from the relational database would be used as the _id in MongoDB.

**III. File System:**

The generated documents themselves will be stored in the file system, with the paths recorded in the `Documents` table.


**Relationships:**

* One-to-many relationship between `Projects` and `Documents`: One project can have many documents.
* One-to-many relationship between `Projects` and `Configuration`: One project can have multiple configuration settings.
* One-to-many relationship between `Users` and `Projects` (if user accounts are implemented).


**Data Model Considerations:**

* **Scalability:** The relational database should be designed to handle a large number of projects and documents. Consider database sharding or other scaling strategies if necessary.
* **Performance:** Indexing is crucial for efficient querying of the database.  Properly indexing `project_id`, `document_type`, and `status` columns will be essential.
* **Security:**  Securely store sensitive information like API keys and user passwords.  Avoid storing them directly in the database; use environment variables or a secure secrets management system.
* **Data Integrity:** Use constraints and validation rules to ensure data quality.


This comprehensive data model ensures efficient storage, retrieval, and management of project data, generated documents, and configuration settings for the `requirements-gathering-agent`.  The choice of NoSQL is optional and depends on the need for advanced text processing or analytics on the generated content. The relational database is the core and essential component.
