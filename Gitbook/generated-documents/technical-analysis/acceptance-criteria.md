# Detailed Acceptance Criteria for the Requirements Gathering Agent Project

Below are the acceptance criteria grouped by feature and requirement, using the **Given-When-Then** format for clarity and testability. Both functional and non-functional requirements, including edge cases, performance criteria, and business rules, are addressed.

---

### **Feature: PMBOK-Compliant Document Generation**

#### **Requirement: Automatically generate PMBOK-compliant project charters**
- **GIVEN** the user provides valid project data (e.g., project name, objectives, high-level requirements) via README.md or other documentation files  
- **WHEN** the command `requirements-gathering-agent --generate project-charter` is executed  
- **THEN** the system must produce a complete, PMBOK-compliant project charter in markdown format, adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards, with all required sections (e.g., objectives, constraints, assumptions).  

- **GIVEN** incomplete or missing project data in the README.md file  
- **WHEN** the system analyzes the project documentation  
- **THEN** it must identify gaps in the input data and provide actionable recommendations for resolving missing or incomplete fields (e.g., "Add project objectives section").  

#### **Requirement: Produce additional PMBOK-compliant documents**
- **GIVEN** comprehensive project documentation in the specified directories (e.g., `requirements`, `docs`, `planning`)  
- **WHEN** the command `requirements-gathering-agent --generate-with-validation` is executed  
- **THEN** the system must generate all PMBOK-compliant documents (e.g., risk management plan, stakeholder register, scope management plan) and validate them against PMBOK standards.  

- **GIVEN** invalid or corrupted documentation files in the project directories  
- **WHEN** the system attempts to analyze the files  
- **THEN** it must log the errors and skip invalid files without crashing, while providing a summary report of skipped files and reasons.

#### **Performance Criteria**
- **GIVEN** a project with up to 100 markdown files  
- **WHEN** the system processes all files to generate PMBOK documents  
- **THEN** the document generation process must complete within 2 minutes on a standard machine (8GB RAM, 4-core CPU).

### **Feature: Intelligent Context Building**

#### **Requirement: Enhanced context building for large language models**
- **GIVEN** a project with a mix of relevant and irrelevant documentation files  
- **WHEN** the system performs context analysis  
- **THEN** it must identify, score, and prioritize relevant files based on predefined criteria (e.g., content relevance, file location, naming patterns) and exclude irrelevant files.  

- **GIVEN** a large project with more context tokens than the model's limit (e.g., >128k tokens for GPT-4)  
- **WHEN** the system processes the documentation  
- **THEN** it must intelligently truncate or summarize context without losing critical information, ensuring output accuracy and relevance.

#### **Performance Criteria**
- **GIVEN** a large project with over 2 million tokens of context  
- **WHEN** the system processes the context using an ultra-large model (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro)  
- **THEN** it must utilize at least 90% of the model's token capacity to maximize context coverage.  

---

### **Feature: CLI Interface**

#### **Requirement: Provide a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for invoking the module**
- **GIVEN** the user has installed the Requirements Gathering Agent via npm  
- **WHEN** the `requirements-gathering-agent --help` command is executed  
- **THEN** the system must display all available commands, options, and usage instructions.  

- **GIVEN** a valid command (e.g., `requirements-gathering-agent --validate-pmbok`)  
- **WHEN** the user executes the command  
- **THEN** the system must successfully execute the requested function and display a summary of the output (e.g., validation results, document paths).  

#### **Requirement: Retry logic for failed document generation**
- **GIVEN** a network failure or temporary API provider outage during document generation  
- **WHEN** the `requirements-gathering-agent --with-retry` command is executed  
- **THEN** the system must implement retry logic with exponential backoff, attempting up to 3 retries before logging the failure and skipping the affected document.

---

### **Feature: AI Provider Integration**

#### **Requirement: Multi-provider AI integration**
- **GIVEN** the user has configured multiple AI providers in the `.env` file  
- **WHEN** the system encounters an issue with the primary AI provider (e.g., Azure OpenAI)  
- **THEN** it must automatically switch to a secondary provider (e.g., Google AI) without user intervention.  

- **GIVEN** the user invokes the interactive AI provider selection menu  
- **WHEN** the system detects available AI providers  
- **THEN** it must display a list of providers with descriptions, setup guidance, and current availability status, allowing the user to select a preferred provider.  

- **GIVEN** an invalid or missing API key for the selected provider  
- **WHEN** the system attempts to connect to the provider  
- **THEN** it must display an error message with troubleshooting steps and fallback to another available provider.

---

### **Feature: Validation and Quality Assurance**

#### **Requirement: PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation**
- **GIVEN** a set of generated documents  
- **WHEN** the `requirements-gathering-agent --validate-pmbok` command is executed  
- **THEN** the system must validate each document against PMBOK 7.0 standards, ensuring required elements are present and content is consistent across documents.  

- **GIVEN** a generated document missing required PMBOK elements  
- **WHEN** the validation process identifies gaps  
- **THEN** it must flag the gaps in the validation report and suggest actionable recommendations for compliance.

#### **Performance Criteria**
- **GIVEN** a project with up to 50 PMBOK documents  
- **WHEN** the system performs validation  
- **THEN** the validation process must complete within 1 minute and produce a detailed compliance report.

---

### **Feature: Context Utilization Reporting**

#### **Requirement: Provide detailed insights into context performance**
- **GIVEN** the user invokes the command `requirements-gathering-agent --context-report`  
- **WHEN** the system analyzes context utilization  
- **THEN** it must generate a report showing token utilization, enriched context items, and performance metrics for each document.  

- **GIVEN** a document that exceeds token limits for a specific AI model  
- **WHEN** the `requirements-gathering-agent --analyze-context` command is executed  
- **THEN** the system must identify the token overflow and provide recommendations for optimizing context inclusion.

---

### **Feature: Modular Architecture**

#### **Requirement: Support modular architecture for extensibility**
- **GIVEN** new requirements for integrating third-party project management tools  
- **WHEN** developers attempt to extend the system  
- **THEN** the modular architecture must allow seamless addition of new modules without affecting existing functionality.  

- **GIVEN** changes to system components (e.g., adding new AI providers or document templates)  
- **WHEN** updates are implemented  
- **THEN** the system must maintain backward compatibility and pass all existing unit tests.

---

### **Feature: Error Handling**

#### **Requirement: Robust error handling**
- **GIVEN** a system error occurs during document generation (e.g., missing input data, API failures)  
- **WHEN** the error is detected  
- **THEN** the system must log the error, notify the user with a clear message, and attempt recovery or retry logic without terminating the entire process.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Security**

- **WHEN** the system connects to Azure APIs  
- **THEN** it must use managed identities via the Azure Identity SDK to ensure secure authentication.  

#### **Scalability**
- **GIVEN** a project with up to 500 relevant markdown files  
- **WHEN** the system performs analysis and document generation  
- **THEN** it must scale efficiently, completing all tasks within 10 minutes and using no more than 2GB of memory.

#### **Usability**
- **GIVEN** a beginner user installs the Requirements Gathering Agent  
- **WHEN** they invoke the `--help` command  
- **THEN** the system must provide clear, concise instructions for basic and advanced usage
