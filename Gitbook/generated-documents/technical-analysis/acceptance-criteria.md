## Acceptance Criteria: Requirements Gathering Agent

These acceptance criteria define the conditions that must be met for the Requirements Gathering Agent to be considered successfully completed and ready for release.  Testing will encompass functional, performance, security, and usability aspects.

**I. Functional Requirements:**

* **A. PMBOK Document Generation:**
    * **A1. Completeness:** The tool generates all 28 PMBOK documents as specified in the documentation when run without any flags.  Each document should contain relevant content based on the input README.md.  A missing document constitutes a failure.
    * **A2. Core Document Generation (`--core-only` flag):** The tool correctly generates only the "Core Analysis" documents when the `--core-only` flag is used.  The output should only contain the four core analysis documents.
    * **A3. Selective Document Generation:** The tool correctly generates only the specified document categories (`--management-plans`, `--planning-artifacts`, `--technical-analysis`) when the corresponding flags are used.  The output should only contain documents from the selected category.
    * **A4. Document Content Accuracy:**  The generated documents accurately reflect the information present in the input README.md, maintaining context and meaning.  Significant factual inaccuracies or omissions constitute a failure.  This will be assessed through manual review and potentially automated checks (e.g., comparing key terms).
    * **A5. PMBOK Compliance:** The generated documents adhere to the standard structure and content expected for each document type within the PMBOK framework.  Deviations from standard PMBOK practices will be evaluated against the latest PMBOK guide.
    * **A6. Format:**  All generated documents are in a readable format (e.g., Markdown, plain text).  The format should be consistent across all documents.

* **B. AI Provider Integration:**
    * **B1. Azure OpenAI:** The tool successfully integrates with Azure OpenAI, generating documents using the specified deployment name and authentication method (Entra ID or API key).  Successful generation with both methods is required.
    * **B2. Google AI Studio:** The tool successfully integrates with Google AI Studio, generating documents using the provided API key and model.
    * **B3. GitHub AI:** The tool successfully integrates with GitHub AI, generating documents using the provided token and model.
    * **B4. Ollama:** The tool successfully integrates with a locally running Ollama instance.
    * **B5. Provider Switching:** The tool seamlessly switches between different AI providers based on the configuration in the `.env` file.


* **C. Error Handling and Retry Logic:**
    * **C1. Robust Error Handling:** The tool handles errors gracefully (e.g., network issues, API rate limits, invalid API keys) and provides informative error messages to the user.  The tool should not crash unexpectedly.
    * **C2. Retry Logic (`--with-retry` flag):** The `--with-retry` flag successfully implements retry logic for failed API calls, with configurable retry attempts and delays.  The retry mechanism should be tested thoroughly with simulated API failures.

* **D. Output Structure:**
    * **D1. Directory Structure:** The generated documents are organized into the specified directory structure.  The correct directory structure is crucial for maintainability and organization.
    * **D2. README.md Index:**  A `README.md` file is generated in the root of the `generated-documents` directory, serving as an index to all generated documents.

**II. Performance Requirements:**

* **A. Generation Time:** The tool should generate all documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined, e.g., under 5 minutes for a standard-sized README).  Performance will be measured under various conditions (different README sizes, different AI providers).
* **B. Resource Consumption:** The tool should not consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory).  Memory usage and CPU load will be monitored during testing.

**III. Security Requirements:**

* **A. API Key Management:** API keys are securely handled and not exposed in the code or output.  Secure storage and handling of sensitive information is crucial.
* **B. Authentication:** Authentication with different AI providers is secure and follows best practices.  Authentication mechanisms will be tested for vulnerabilities.

**IV. Usability Requirements:**

* **A. Command-Line Interface:** The command-line interface is intuitive and easy to use.  The usability of the CLI will be assessed through user testing.
* **B. Documentation:** The documentation is clear, comprehensive, and easy to understand.  The documentation will be reviewed for clarity and completeness.
* **C. Error Messages:** Error messages are clear, concise, and helpful to the user.  The clarity and helpfulness of error messages will be assessed.


**V.  Deployment Requirements:**

* The tool should be successfully installable via `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent` and executable via the command line as described in the documentation.  Installation and execution will be tested on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).


These acceptance criteria will be verified through a combination of automated testing (unit tests, integration tests) and manual testing.  The specific thresholds for performance metrics (e.g., generation time) will be defined before testing begins.
