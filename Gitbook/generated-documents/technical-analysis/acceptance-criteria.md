## Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

These acceptance criteria are structured by feature, using the Given-When-Then format where appropriate, and encompassing functional and non-functional requirements.  Specific performance targets are left intentionally vague as they will depend on the specific hardware and AI model used, but should be defined in a separate performance testing plan.

**I. Core Functionality: PMBOK Document Generation**

* **Feature:** Generation of 29 PMBOK documents from a project's README and associated files.

    * **AC1 (Completeness):** GIVEN a valid project directory containing a README.md and other relevant documentation, WHEN the `requirements-gathering-agent` command is executed, THEN all 29 PMBOK documents (as listed in the README) are generated in the specified output directory.  Missing documents should result in informative error messages specifying the cause.
    * **AC2 (Correctness):** GIVEN a project directory, WHEN the tool generates a specific PMBOK document (e.g., Project Charter), THEN the generated document contains all required sections and information according to PMBOK 7.0 standards for that document type.  The content should accurately reflect the information extracted from the source files.
    * **AC3 (Format):** GIVEN a specified output format (markdown, json, yaml), WHEN the tool generates the documents, THEN all generated documents are in the correct format with valid structure and syntax.  Error handling should prevent corrupted or incomplete files.
    * **AC4 (File Organization):** GIVEN a successful generation run, THEN the generated documents are organized into the specified directory structure (as shown in the README) with appropriate file naming conventions.
    * **AC5 (Error Handling):** GIVEN invalid input (e.g., missing README, incorrect directory structure, insufficient permissions), WHEN the tool is executed, THEN appropriate error messages are displayed to the user, clearly indicating the problem and suggesting solutions. The tool should gracefully handle exceptions without crashing.
    * **AC6 (Partial Generation):** GIVEN a failure to generate one or more documents (due to API errors or other issues), WHEN the `--with-retry` flag is used, THEN the tool should retry generation of failed documents up to a configurable number of times.  A log should record attempts and results.


**II. Enhanced Project Analysis**

* **Feature:** Comprehensive analysis of project files beyond README.md.

    * **AC7 (File Discovery):** GIVEN a project directory with files in standard locations (requirements/, docs/, etc.), WHEN the tool performs project analysis, THEN it correctly identifies and analyzes all relevant markdown files within the specified depth and excludes system directories.  A log should show files discovered and their relevance scores.
    * **AC8 (Relevance Scoring):** GIVEN a set of markdown files, WHEN the tool analyzes them, THEN each file receives a relevance score (0-100) that reflects its content relevance to project management concepts and its strategic placement.  The scoring algorithm should be documented and auditable.
    * **AC9 (Categorization):** GIVEN a set of analyzed files, WHEN the tool categorizes them, THEN each file is correctly assigned to one of the predefined categories (Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other).
    * **AC10 (High-Value Source Identification):** GIVEN a set of analyzed files, WHEN the tool identifies high-value sources, THEN it correctly prioritizes the most relevant files for context inclusion in document generation.  The selection criteria should be documented.


**III. Enhanced Context Manager**

* **Feature:** Intelligent context management for large language models.

    * **AC11 (Context Utilization):** GIVEN different AI models (GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.), WHEN generating documents, THEN the context manager should utilize an appropriate percentage of the model's token limit (as specified in the README table), maximizing context without exceeding limits.  A report should detail context usage.
    * **AC12 (3-Phase Strategy):** GIVEN a large project with many files, WHEN generating documents, THEN the context manager should follow the 3-phase strategy (Core, Ultra-Large, Large Supplementary) adapting to the chosen AI model's capabilities.  A log should show the phases used.
    * **AC13 (Context Report):** GIVEN the `--context-report` flag, WHEN the tool is executed, THEN a detailed report is generated showing context utilization statistics (tokens used, model type, utilization percentage).
    * **AC14 (Model Detection):** GIVEN an environment variable specifying an AI model, WHEN the tool starts, THEN it correctly identifies and configures the context manager for that specific model.  Fallback mechanisms should be in place for unsupported models.


**IV.  AI Provider Integration**

* **Feature:** Support for multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama).

    * **AC15 (Azure OpenAI):** GIVEN properly configured Azure OpenAI credentials, WHEN using Azure OpenAI as the provider, THEN the tool should successfully generate documents using the specified model and deployment.
    * **AC16 (Google AI Studio):** GIVEN properly configured Google AI Studio credentials, WHEN using Google AI Studio as the provider, THEN the tool should successfully generate documents using the specified model.
    * **AC17 (GitHub AI):** GIVEN properly configured GitHub AI credentials, WHEN using GitHub AI as the provider, THEN the tool should successfully generate documents using the specified model.
    * **AC18 (Ollama):** GIVEN a running Ollama instance, WHEN using Ollama as the provider, THEN the tool should successfully generate documents using the specified model.


**V. Validation and Quality Assurance**

* **Feature:** PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and quality assessment.

    * **AC19 (PMBOK Compliance):** GIVEN a generated PMBOK document, WHEN the tool performs validation, THEN it checks for the presence of all required sections and elements according to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  A report should detail compliance issues.
    * **AC20 (Quality Assessment):** GIVEN a generated document, WHEN the tool performs quality assessment, THEN it provides a quality score (0-100) and actionable recommendations for improvement.
    * **AC21 (Consistency):** GIVEN multiple related PMBOK documents, WHEN the tool checks for cross-document consistency, THEN it identifies and reports inconsistencies in terminology, facts, or references.
    * **AC22 (Validation Reports):** GIVEN the `--validate-pmbok` or `--generate-with-validation` flags, WHEN the tool is executed, THEN comprehensive validation reports are generated, detailing compliance status, quality scores, and recommendations.


**VI.  Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

* **Feature:** User-friendly CLI for managing the tool.

    * **AC23 (Command Execution):** GIVEN valid CLI commands (as listed in the README), WHEN executed, THEN the tool performs the intended action (generate documents, validate, report, etc.) without errors.
    * **AC24 (Help and Version):** GIVEN the `-h` or `--help` flag, WHEN executed, THEN the tool displays a comprehensive help message showing all available options.  The `-v` or `--version` flag should display the current version.
    * **AC25 (Option Handling):** GIVEN various CLI options, WHEN executed, THEN the tool correctly interprets and applies the specified options (output directory, format, validation flags, etc.).


These acceptance criteria provide a comprehensive basis for testing the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Specific thresholds for performance metrics (e.g., generation time, API call success rate) should be defined separately based on realistic expectations and performance testing.
