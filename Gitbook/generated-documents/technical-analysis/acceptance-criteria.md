# Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

Based on the provided project context, the following detailed acceptance criteria are defined for each feature and requirement. Each criterion is presented using the **Given-When-Then** format and includes specifications for functional and non-functional requirements, edge cases, performance, business rules, and data conditions.

---

## **Feature: PMBOK-Compliant Document Generation**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-1: Automatic generation of PMBOK-compliant project charters**
- **GIVEN** the Requirements Gathering Agent is installed and the project has a valid README file or other markdown documentation.
- **WHEN** the user runs the command `requirements-gathering-agent --generate-with-validation`.
- **THEN** a PMBOK-compliant project charter is generated and saved in the output directory.

#### Edge Case:
- **GIVEN** the README file is incomplete or missing key sections.
- **WHEN** the agent analyzes the README and other markdown files.
- **THEN** the agent includes additional discovered context files with relevance scores above 75 to complete the generated project charter.

---

#### **FR-2: Generation of additional PMBOK-compliant documents**
- **GIVEN** the Requirements Gathering Agent is installed and has access to relevant markdown files (e.g., `architecture.md`, `stakeholders.md`).
- **WHEN** the user runs the command `requirements-gathering-agent --core-only`.
- **THEN** core PMBOK documents such as stakeholder registers, scope management plans, and risk management plans are generated in JSON format in the specified output directory.

#### Edge Case:
- **GIVEN** some required files are missing from the project directory.
- **WHEN** the agent performs context analysis and finds insufficient relevant documentation.
- **THEN** the agent raises a warning and generates placeholder documents with suggestions for manually adding missing content.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Performance Criteria: Document generation time**
- **GIVEN** a project with no more than 20 markdown files and a total token count under 2 million.
- **WHEN** the agent is executed for full PMBOK document generation.
- **THEN** all documents must be generated within 60 seconds.

#### **Business Rule: PMBOK compliance validation**
- **GIVEN** the `--validate-pmbok` flag is enabled during execution.
- **WHEN** the documents are generated.
- **THEN** each document must meet PMBOK 7.0 standards for structure, terminology, and completeness, with consistency scores above 85%.

---

## **Feature: Enhanced Context Manager**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-6: Schema validation on generated outputs**
- **GIVEN** the agent generates PMBOK documents.
- **WHEN** the output files are validated using the schema validation module.
- **THEN** the documents must pass all validation checks for correct structure, required fields, and data types.

---

#### **FR-7: Modular architecture for future extensions**
- **GIVEN** the Requirements Gathering Agent has been deployed.
- **WHEN** a developer integrates a new AI provider (e.g., Hugging Face models).
- **THEN** the modular architecture allows seamless integration without affecting existing functionality.

---

### **Performance Criteria**

#### **Efficiency of context injection**
- **GIVEN** a project with 15 markdown files and 2,000,000 tokens available for the context window.
- **WHEN** the Enhanced Context Manager optimizes context usage.
- **THEN** at least 75% of relevant tokens must be utilized, with priority given to files scoring above 80 relevance.

---

### **Edge Cases**

#### **Handling of token overflow**
- **GIVEN** the context size exceeds the token limit of the AI model.
- **WHEN** the Enhanced Context Manager processes context.
- **THEN** non-critical files (relevance score < 50) are truncated or excluded to fit within the token limit.

---

## **Feature: Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-5: CLI for invoking the agent**
- **GIVEN** the Requirements Gathering Agent is installed globally or run via `npx`.
- **WHEN** the user invokes the `requirements-gathering-agent` command with any valid options.
- **THEN** the CLI processes the command and displays progress updates, with all outputs saved in the specified directory.

---

### **Edge Cases**

#### **Invalid commands or flags**
- **GIVEN** the user enters an invalid CLI command or flag.
- **WHEN** the CLI processes the input.
- **THEN** the CLI must display a clear error message, including valid options, without crashing.

---

## **Feature: AI Provider Integration**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-3: Integration with Azure AI inference APIs**
- **GIVEN** the `.env` file contains valid Azure OpenAI credentials.
- **WHEN** the agent is executed.
- **THEN** the AI provider must authenticate successfully using Entra ID and process requests without errors.

#### Edge Case:
- **GIVEN** the Azure OpenAI credentials are invalid or expired.
- **WHEN** the agent attempts to authenticate.
- **THEN** the agent must retry authentication up to three times before displaying an error message.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Multi-provider support**
- **GIVEN** more than one AI provider is configured in the `.env` file.
- **WHEN** the primary provider fails or is unavailable.
- **THEN** the agent must fall back to the next available provider without requiring user intervention.

---

## **Feature: Intelligent Source Discovery**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-8: Discovery and analysis of markdown files**
- **GIVEN** the project contains multiple markdown files across directories.
- **WHEN** the agent performs context analysis.
- **THEN** all relevant files must be scored (0-100) and categorized into primary, planning, development, documentation, and other categories.

---

### **Edge Cases**

#### **Non-standard file names or locations**
- **GIVEN** markdown files have non-standard names (e.g., `custom-spec.md`) or are located in unusual directories.
- **WHEN** the agent performs its analysis.
- **THEN** the agent must use content relevance scoring to include these files (score > 60) even if the file names or locations are unconventional.

---

## **Feature: Quality Assessment and Validation**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-9: Quality scoring for generated documents**
- **GIVEN** the agent generates PMBOK documents.
- **WHEN** quality assessment is enabled.
- **THEN** each document must receive a quality score (0-100), with actionable recommendations for scores below 90.

#### **FR-10: Cross-document consistency validation**
- **GIVEN** multiple related documents are generated (e.g., project charter and scope management plan).
- **WHEN** consistency validation is run.
- **THEN** all cross-references and terminology must match, and inconsistencies must be flagged with suggestions for resolution.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

#### **Validation reporting**
- **GIVEN** validation is enabled using the `--validate-only` flag.
- **WHEN** the agent runs validation.
- **THEN** detailed compliance and quality reports must be provided in markdown format within the output directory.

---

## **Feature: Output Management**

### **Functional Requirements**

#### **FR-11: Output in strict JSON format**
- **GIVEN** the agent generates PMBOK documents.
- **WHEN** the `--format json` flag is used.
- **THEN** all outputs must be serialized into valid JSON format, with schema validation enforced.

---

### **Edge Cases**

#### **Directory write permissions**
- **GIVEN** the specified output directory lacks write permissions.
