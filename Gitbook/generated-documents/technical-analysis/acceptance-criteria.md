# Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

---

## 1. Installation & Setup

### 1.1 Global Installation
- User can install the tool globally via `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent` without errors.
- After global install, the command `requirements-gathering-agent` is available in the terminal.

### 1.2 Direct Execution via npx
- User can run the tool directly with `npx requirements-gathering-agent` without prior installation.

### 1.3 Node.js Version Compatibility
- The tool validates Node.js version on startup.
- If Node.js version < 18.0.0, the tool outputs a clear message and exits.

### 1.4 Environment Configuration
- The tool reads `.env` file for AI provider configuration.
- Supports Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, and Ollama configurations as per documentation.
- If required environment variables are missing or invalid, the tool outputs descriptive error messages.
- Supports usage of Entra ID authentication with Azure OpenAI via `az login`.
- Supports API key authentication via `AZURE_AI_API_KEY`.
- Supports GitHub token authentication.
- Supports Ollama local server connection.

## 2. Command Line Interface (CLI) Functionality

### 2.1 Help and Version Commands
- `requirements-gathering-agent -h` or `--help` displays detailed usage instructions.
- `requirements-gathering-agent -v` or `--version` outputs current version number consistent with npm registry.

### 2.2 Document Generation Options
- `requirements-gathering-agent` (no options): generates **all** 28 PMBOK-compliant documents.
- `--core-only`: generates **only** Core Analysis documents.
- `--management-plans`: generates **only** Management Plans documents.
- `--planning-artifacts`: generates **only** Planning Artifacts documents.
- `--technical-analysis`: generates **only** Technical Analysis documents.
- Multiple options are mutually exclusive; if more than one category option is provided, the tool outputs an error.

### 2.3 Retry Logic
- `--with-retry`: when specified, failed document generations are retried up to 3 times before final failure.
- Retry attempts and status are logged and displayed to the user.

---

## 3. Document Generation & Output

### 3.1 Generated Documents
- The tool generates exactly the 28 documents specified under each category.
- Document content conforms to PMBOK standards and the project README input.
- Documents are written as text or markdown files with consistent formatting and professional language.

### 3.2 Directory Structure
- Generated documents are saved under the root folder `generated-documents/`.
- Subfolders created exactly as:
  - `core-analysis/`
  - `project-charter/`
  - `management-plans/`
  - `planning-artifacts/`
  - `stakeholder-management/`
  - `technical-analysis/`
- Each folder contains the appropriate documents described in the README.
- A `README.md` master index file is created in `generated-documents/` listing all generated documents with brief descriptions and relative paths.

### 3.3 File Naming & Organization
- Each document file is named clearly and consistently (e.g., `project-summary-and-goals.md`).
- No naming collisions occur.
- Files have appropriate file extensions (.md or .txt).

### 3.4 Content Quality
- Documents reflect accurate extraction of project information from input README.
- Key PMBOK elements are present in each document as per category requirements.
- AI-generated content is coherent, grammatically correct, and professional in tone.
- Technical analysis documents include relevant technology stack suggestions and compliance considerations.

## 4. AI Provider Integration

### 4.1 Azure OpenAI Integration
- When configured with Azure OpenAI endpoint and deployment, tool successfully authenticates with Entra ID or API key.
- Tool can send prompts to GPT-4 or specified model and retrieve responses.
- Errors from Azure API are handled gracefully with clear messages.

### 4.2 GitHub AI Integration
- When configured with GitHub token and endpoint, tool can authenticate and generate documents.
- API rate limits and errors are handled gracefully with meaningful error messages.

### 4.3 Ollama Local Integration
- When configured to connect to local Ollama server, tool sends generation requests and processes responses.
- If Ollama server is not running or unreachable, tool outputs clear error and advice.

---

## 5. Error Handling & Logging

### 5.1 Input Validation
- Tool validates all command line options.
- Provides descriptive errors for invalid or missing options.

### 5.2 AI Request Failures
- All AI request failures (network, authentication, API errors) are caught.
- Errors are logged to console with sufficient detail.
- When `--with-retry` is enabled, tool retries failed requests up to 3 times before failing.

### 5.3 File System Errors
- Errors in writing files (permissions, disk space) are caught and reported.
- Partial outputs are cleaned up or clearly indicated.

### 5.4 User Feedback
- Progress messages are shown during generation (e.g., "Generating Project Charter... done").
- Final summary shows success or failure status for each document.

---

## 6. Development & Build

### 6.1 Build Process
- Running `npm run build` compiles the project without errors.
- The build produces a production-ready executable or script.

### 6.2 Local Execution
- Running `npm start` runs the tool locally with expected behavior.
- Local runs respect `.env` configurations.

### 6.3 Dependency Management
- `npm install` installs all required dependencies without errors.
- No deprecated or vulnerable packages are included.

---

## 7. Documentation & Support

### 7.1 Documentation Completeness
- The README file clearly explains installation, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting steps.
- Examples for all CLI options are provided.

### 7.2 Support Links
- Links to documentation, issues, and discussions on GitHub are present and functional.

---

## 8. Security & Compliance

### 8.1 Sensitive Data Handling
- API keys and tokens are never logged or exposed in error messages.
- `.env` file is ignored in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

### 8.2 Authentication Security
- Entra ID authentication uses secure Azure CLI login flows.
- Token expiration and refresh are handled transparently or cause clear error prompting re-login.

# Summary

The Requirements Gathering Agent must provide a seamless, user-friendly CLI tool that generates a full suite of PMBOK-compliant documents from a project README using AI providers. It must handle multiple authentication methods securely, provide robust error handling and retry logic, and produce well-organized, professional-quality output documents consistent with the project documentation.
