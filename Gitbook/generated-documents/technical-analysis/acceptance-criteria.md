# Acceptance Criteria for Requirements Gathering Agent

---

## 1. Multi-Provider AI Support

- [ ] The system must support the following AI providers:
  - Azure OpenAI with Entra ID authentication
  - Azure OpenAI with API Key authentication
  - GitHub AI Models (via Codespaces & Actions integration)
  - Ollama (local AI for offline development)
  - Azure AI Studio (enterprise managed services)

- [ ] The system must automatically detect and fallback between AI providers if the primary provider fails or is not configured.

- [ ] Configuration of AI providers is done exclusively via environment variables (.env file).

- [ ] Switching between AI providers is seamless by updating environment variables without code changes.

- [ ] The system must enforce strict JSON output formatting for all AI-generated responses to ensure easy integration.

---

## 2. Strategic Planning Features

- [ ] The system must generate the following strategic sections based on input:
  - Project vision statement
  - Mission statement
  - Core values
  - Purpose statement

- [ ] The system must identify user roles, their needs, and associated processes based on the input business problem and technology stack.

- [ ] The system must analyze the provided technology stack and generate recommendations.

- [ ] The strategic planning generation must accept input parameters:
  - `businessProblem` (string)
  - `technologyStack` (string array)
  - `contextBundle` (string)

- [ ] The output of strategic planning generation must be a structured JSON object containing vision, mission, coreValues, and purpose.

---

## 3. PMBOK-Aligned Documentation Generation

### Initiating Process Group

- [ ] The system must generate a complete Project Charter document that includes:
  - Project authorization details
  - Business problem description
  - Strategic statements
  - Core values and purpose
  - Risk analysis overview
  - Personas and key roles

- [ ] The system must generate a comprehensive Stakeholder Register including:
  - Stakeholder identification
  - Stakeholder analysis (influence, interest, roles)

### Planning Process Group - Management Plans

- [ ] The system must generate the following management plans, each compliant with PMBOK guidelines:
  - Scope Management Plan
  - Requirements Management Plan
  - Schedule Management Plan
  - Cost Management Plan
  - Quality Management Plan
  - Resource Management Plan
  - Communications Management Plan
  - Risk Management Plan
  - Procurement Management Plan
  - Stakeholder Engagement Plan

- [ ] Each management plan must include:
  - Definitions of scope, schedule, cost, quality, resources, communications, risks, procurement, or stakeholder engagement as relevant
  - Procedures and control measures for the respective area

### Planning Process Group - Detailed Artifacts

- [ ] The system must generate the following detailed planning artifacts:
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) in hierarchical format
  - WBS Dictionary with detailed work package descriptions
  - Activity List listing all project activities
  - Activity Duration Estimates for each activity
  - Activity Resource Estimates per activity
  - Schedule Network Diagram depicting dependencies and relationships
  - Milestone List with key deliverables and checkpoints

- [ ] The generated artifacts must be formatted as markdown or JSON suitable for integration and documentation.

### Additional Analysis & Considerations

- [ ] The system must generate:
  - Technology Stack Analysis with architecture and tool recommendations
  - Risk Analysis including risk identification, assessment, and mitigation strategies
  - Compliance Considerations covering relevant regulatory and standards requirements
  - UI/UX Considerations with user experience and interface design guidelines

---

## 4. Technical Features

- [ ] The system must provide a command-line interface (CLI) to generate all PMBOK documents in bulk and individually.

- [ ] The CLI must support:
  - Building the project (`npm run build`)
  - Running the project (`npm start`)
  - Generating documents (`npm run generate-docs` or `node dist/cli.js`)
  - Development mode with auto-compilation (`npm run dev`)

- [ ] The system must support modular architecture allowing:
  - Importing specific document generation functions (e.g., `getAiProjectCharter`)
  - Integration into any Node.js/TypeScript project with ease

- [ ] The system must accept input parameters consistently across all API functions:
  - `businessProblem`: string
  - `technologyStack`: string[]
  - `contextBundle`: string

- [ ] The system must support configuration of model selection via environment variable `REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_MODEL`.

- [ ] The system must support usage of high-token LLM models to process and generate longer documents without token limit issues.

- [ ] The system must ensure all AI-generated outputs are parseable and valid JSON where applicable.

- [ ] The system must allow local AI usage through Ollama for offline development workflows.

---

## 5. Configuration and Setup

- [ ] The system must provide clear `.env.example` file with all necessary environment variables for all supported AI providers.

- [ ] The system must validate the presence and correctness of required environment variables on startup and provide meaningful error messages if misconfigured.

- [ ] The system must support Azure OpenAI authentication via Entra ID or API key with proper validation.

- [ ] The system must provide scripts or commands to check local Ollama availability and start the service if needed.

---

## 6. Integration and Extensibility

- [ ] The system must allow copying the entire agent directory into any existing Node.js/TypeScript project without conflicts.

- [ ] The system must document clear import instructions for using either the npm package or local copy with relative imports.

- [ ] The system must provide example scripts demonstrating generation of full project documentation, including strategic, PMBOK, and technical analysis documents.

- [ ] The system must allow generated documents to be saved in any user-defined directory structure.

---

## 7. Documentation and Usability

- [ ] The system must include comprehensive README or documentation covering:
  - Installation instructions
  - Configuration for all AI providers
  - Usage examples for API and CLI
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Best practices for performance optimization

- [ ] All generated documents must be well-structured, clear, and follow PMBOK terminology and formatting conventions.

- [ ] The system must handle errors gracefully and provide actionable feedback to the user.

---

## 8. Performance and Reliability

- [ ] The system must cache repeated requests or implement rate limiting to avoid unnecessary AI provider usage and reduce costs.

- [ ] The system must handle AI provider rate limits or failures by triggering fallback mechanisms without crashing.

- [ ] The system must complete generation of full PMBOK documentation within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 2 minutes for typical project inputs).

---

## 9. Security and Compliance

- [ ] The system must never expose API keys or sensitive credentials in logs or error messages.

- [ ] The system must comply with enterprise security best practices when using Azure OpenAI with Entra ID.

- [ ] The system must support regulatory compliance considerations as part of generated documentation.
