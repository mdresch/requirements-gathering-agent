# Schedule Development Input: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## 1. Document Overview

This document consolidates schedule development inputs for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project. It integrates information from the project README, requirements documents (including `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`), and the API testing summary (`API-TESTING-COMPREHENSIVE-SUMMARY.MD`).  The schedule will support the development, testing, and deployment of a production-ready API.

## 2. Activity Information

### 2.1 Activity List Summary

**Total Activities:**  Estimated at 30-40 activities (a precise number requires a detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) â€“ see section 4).

**Activity Categories:**  API Development, API Testing, Documentation Creation, Deployment,  Infrastructure Setup,  Template Development,  Security Implementation (if applicable - see Project Requirements for clarification).

**Activity Sources:** Project README, `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`,  `ARCHITECTURE.MD`,  `AZURE-PORTAL-API-REGISTRATION-GUIDE.MD`, `IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE-PROVIDER-CHOICE-MENU.MD`,  `SHAREPOINT-USAGE-GUIDE.MD`, and expert judgment.

## 3. Activity Sequencing

### 3.1 Dependency Types

* **Finish-to-Start (FS):** Predominant dependency type.  e.g., API endpoint design must finish before controller development can begin.
* **Start-to-Start (SS):** Used for parallel tasks, such as unit and integration testing.
* **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Less common, but may be used for tasks like documentation and deployment that need to be finalized concurrently.

### 3.2 Major Dependencies (Partial - requires WBS completion)

This table shows a few examples. A complete dependency list requires a detailed WBS.

| AI Provider Outage        | Medium      | High   | 5-10                    | Use multiple AI providers, implement fallback mechanisms.        |
| Unexpected Technical Issues | Low         | High   | 3-7                     | Allocate contingency time, thorough design and testing.         |
| Deployment Failure         | Low         | High   | 2-5                     | Test deployment thoroughly, have rollback plan.                  |


### 7.3 Schedule Buffers

Contingency buffers will be added to the schedule to account for potential delays.  The amount of buffer will depend on the risk assessment.


## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

### 8.1 Key Assumptions

* **Team Availability:**  The development team will be available as planned.
* **AI Provider Reliability:**  AI providers will maintain consistent performance.
* **Azure Service Availability:** Azure services will be available and perform as expected.

### 8.2 Project Constraints (already covered in section 6)


This Schedule Development Input provides a framework.  A detailed WBS is necessary for a complete and accurate project schedule.  The WBS will further refine activities, dependencies, durations, and resource assignments, providing a more precise basis for schedule creation.
