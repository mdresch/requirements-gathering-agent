# Schedule Development Input: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

## 1. Document Overview

This document consolidates all necessary inputs for developing a comprehensive project schedule for the ADPA project.  It draws information from the project README,  `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`, `PROJECT-REQUIREMENTS-NO-SECURITY.MD`, `ARCHITECTURE.MD`, and other relevant project documentation.  This input will be used to create a schedule that aligns with the project's goals, milestones, and constraints.  The schedule will be developed using a critical path method (CPM) and will be regularly updated to reflect progress and changes.


## 2. Activity Information

This section outlines the activities required for the ADPA project.  Due to the iterative and evolving nature of the project, a complete, definitive activity list is challenging to provide at this stage. However, we can identify key activity categories and examples.  A more precise activity list will be refined during detailed planning sessions.

### 2.1 Activity List Summary

**Total Activities:**  Estimated at 50-75 activities (this is a preliminary estimate and will be refined).

**Activity Categories:**

* **Development:** Core application development, module creation (Context Manager, AI Provider Integration, Document Generation Engine, CLI), unit testing, integration testing.
* **Testing:** Unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, security testing (though explicitly not a high priority in initial scope).
* **Documentation:**  Creating user guides, API documentation, technical design documents, this Schedule Development Input, and other documentation elements.
* **Deployment:**  Packaging, deployment to NPM, and potential integration with other platforms (SharePoint, Confluence, etc.).
* **Management:** Project management tasks (meetings, reporting, risk management, scope management, etc.).
* **Maintenance:** Bug fixing, performance improvements, and ongoing maintenance.

**Activity Sources:** Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (implicitly defined in the README and related documents), expert input (development team), and project management best practices.


### 2.2 Activity Attributes (Examples)

| Activity ID | Activity Name                               | Type        | Complexity | Priority      | Estimated Duration |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| DEV-001     | Develop Core Context Management Module       | Development | High        | Critical        | 2 weeks              |
| DEV-002     | Implement Azure OpenAI Integration           | Development | High        | High            | 1 week               |
| DEV-003     | Design Document Generation Templates         | Development | Medium      | High            | 1 week               |
| TEST-001    | Conduct Unit Tests on Context Manager        | Testing     | Medium      | High            | 1 week               |
| DOC-001     | Write User Guide                             | Documentation | Medium      | High            | 1 week               |
| DEP-001     | Deploy to NPM                               | Deployment  | Low         | Critical        | 1 day                |


## 3. Activity Sequencing

Defining precise dependencies requires a more detailed WBS, but we can identify some high-level dependencies.

### 3.1 Dependency Types

* **Finish-to-Start (FS):**  Most common dependency type.  For example, the development of the Context Manager must finish before the implementation of AI Provider Integration.
* **Start-to-Start (SS):**  Used for parallel activities.  For example, unit testing of different modules can occur concurrently.
* **Finish-to-Finish (FF):** Less common in this project.  Might be used for documentation and deployment tasks needing to be completed simultaneously.


### 3.2 Major Dependencies (Examples)

| Predecessor          | Successor                  | Dependency Type | Lag/Lead (days) | Rationale                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DEV-001 (Context Mgr)| DEV-002 (Azure OpenAI Int.) | FS              | 0               | Context Manager must be functional before integrating with Azure OpenAI.       |
| DEV-002 (Azure OpenAI)| TEST-001 (Unit Tests)       | FS              | 0               | Integration must be complete before testing.                                   |
| TEST-001 (Unit Tests) | DEP-001 (Deploy to NPM)     | FS              | 0               | Testing should be complete before deployment.                               |


### 3.3 External Dependencies

* **Vendor Dependencies:** None explicitly identified, but potential delays from AI provider APIs are a risk.
* **Client Dependencies:** None directly, but user feedback during UAT.
* **Regulatory Dependencies:** None currently identified.


## 4. Resource Information

## 7. Risk Factors

### 7.1 Schedule Risk Sources

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with AI providers, unexpected complexities in development.
* **Resource Risks:**  Resource unavailability, skill gaps, team turnover.
* **External Risks:**  AI provider API outages, changes in AI provider pricing or policies.

### 7.2 Risk Impact on Schedule (Examples)

| Risk                               | Probability | Impact | Schedule Effect (days) | Mitigation Strategy                                                                        |
|------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Azure OpenAI API Outage             | Medium      | High   | 5-10                    | Implement fallback mechanisms to other AI providers; monitor API status closely.                |
| Key Developer Unavailability       | Low         | Medium | 2-5                     | Ensure adequate cross-training; have backup developers available.                          |
| Unexpected Complexity in Module X  | Low         | Medium | 3-7                     | Allocate contingency buffer; break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units.       |


### 7.3 Schedule Buffers

Activity buffers, a project buffer, and a management reserve will be allocated based on a risk assessment.


## 8. Assumptions and Constraints

This section mirrors the constraints section, but adds specific assumptions.


## 9.  Conclusion

This Schedule Development Input provides a foundational framework for creating a detailed project schedule for ADPA. The next step involves refining the activity list, defining dependencies more precisely, and assigning resources and durations to activities.  Regular review and updates to this schedule will be crucial to ensure its continued relevance and accuracy throughout the project lifecycle.
