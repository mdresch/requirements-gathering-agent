# WBS Dictionary

## Document Overview

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed definitions for each work package within the "ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API" project.  It serves as a reference document for project managers, developers, and stakeholders, ensuring a shared understanding of tasks, deliverables, and responsibilities.  This document is directly linked to the project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), providing a detailed description for each WBS element.  It should be used in conjunction with the project's overall schedule and risk management plan.


## Work Package Definitions

**Note:**  The following WBS structure is inferred from the provided project documentation. A more precise WBS would require a formal project plan.  This dictionary uses a simplified WBS code for illustrative purposes.


### 1.1 - API Development

**Description:** Design, develop, and test the core Express.js API, including all endpoints, middleware, and services for document generation and template management.  This includes implementing robust error handling, security measures (authentication, rate limiting), and input validation using Zod schemas.

**Deliverables:**
- Fully functional Express.js API codebase.
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests for all API endpoints.
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification document (`api-specs/`).
- API documentation (Swagger UI).
- Deployment scripts for development and production environments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All API endpoints function as specified in the OpenAPI specification.
- 100% test coverage for critical API components.
- API meets performance targets (response times, throughput).
- API is secure and protected against common vulnerabilities.

**Responsible Party:** Development Team (Lead Developer, Backend Engineers)
**Skills Required:** Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, OpenAPI, testing frameworks (Jest), security best practices.
**Estimated Effort:** 400 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 8 weeks

**Dependencies:**  Completion of API design (1.0).
**Constraints:**  Resource availability (developers), third-party API dependencies.
**Assumptions:**  Availability of necessary infrastructure (servers, databases).
**Risks:**  API performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities. Mitigation:  Performance testing, regular security audits.


### 1.2 - API Design

**Description:** Design the API architecture, including defining endpoints, data models, and request/response structures using TypeSpec.  This includes creating a comprehensive OpenAPI specification.

**Deliverables:**
- Detailed API design document.
- TypeSpec definitions for all API endpoints and data models.
- OpenAPI 3.0 specification document.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- API design aligns with API-first principles.
- TypeSpec definitions are complete and consistent.
- OpenAPI specification is valid and comprehensive.

**Responsible Party:**  Lead Architect, API Designer
**Skills Required:** API design principles, TypeSpec, OpenAPI, RESTful architecture.
**Estimated Effort:** 80 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks

**Dependencies:**  Completion of requirements gathering (0.1).
**Constraints:**  Alignment with existing systems.
**Assumptions:**  Clear understanding of project requirements.
**Risks:**  Design flaws, lack of scalability. Mitigation:  Design reviews, thorough testing.



### 2.1 - Framework Generation Engine

**Description:** Develop the core engine responsible for generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks. This includes integrating with various AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) and implementing robust error handling.

**Deliverables:**
- Functional framework generation engine.
- Integration with chosen AI providers.
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Engine generates accurate and complete BABOK v3 frameworks.
- Integration with AI providers is reliable and efficient.
- 100% test coverage for core engine components.

**Responsible Party:**  AI Integration Engineer, Backend Engineers
**Skills Required:**  AI integration, natural language processing, BABOK v3 knowledge.
**Estimated Effort:** 300 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks

**Dependencies:**  Completion of API development (1.1).
**Constraints:**  AI provider API limitations, data processing speed.
**Assumptions:**  Reliable access to chosen AI providers.
**Risks:**  AI model limitations, inaccurate framework generation. Mitigation:  Model selection, rigorous testing, human review.


### 3.1 - Documentation & Deployment

**Description:**  Create comprehensive documentation for the API and application, including user guides, API specifications, and deployment instructions. Deploy the application to a production environment.

**Deliverables:**
- User guide for API and application.
- Updated API documentation (Swagger UI).
- Deployment scripts and procedures.
- Production deployment to chosen platform.


**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documentation is clear, concise, and accurate.
- API documentation is up-to-date and reflects the latest API version.
- Application deploys successfully to the production environment.

**Responsible Party:**  Documentation Writer, DevOps Engineer
**Skills Required:** Technical writing, documentation tools, deployment best practices.
**Estimated Effort:** 100 hours
**Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks

**Dependencies:**  Completion of API development (1.1), framework generation engine (2.1).
**Constraints:**  Deployment platform limitations, infrastructure availability.
**Assumptions:**  Production environment is ready.
**Risks:**  Deployment failures, documentation errors. Mitigation:  Thorough testing, version control, review process.


## Work Package Cross-Reference

*(A detailed cross-reference table would be included here, showing dependencies between work packages, responsibilities, and timelines.  This would be a separate table or spreadsheet.)*


## Dictionary Maintenance

This WBS Dictionary will be reviewed and updated at least bi-weekly, or more frequently as needed, to reflect changes in project scope, timelines, or responsibilities.  Version control will be maintained using a document management system.  All changes will be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
