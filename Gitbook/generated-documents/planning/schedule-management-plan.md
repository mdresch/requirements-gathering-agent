# Schedule Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Schedule Management Plan outlines the approach for planning, scheduling, executing, monitoring, and controlling the schedule for the ADPA project.  The plan leverages agile principles alongside PMBOK 7.0 guidelines to ensure timely delivery and adaptation to evolving needs.  Given the AI-driven nature of the project, iterative development and flexible scheduling are key.

**2. Project Schedule Methodology**

The project will utilize a hybrid agile/waterfall approach.  High-level milestones and deliverables will follow a waterfall structure, providing a clear roadmap and facilitating communication with stakeholders.  Within each milestone, the development team will employ agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum or Kanban) for iterative development and flexible task management. This hybrid approach allows for the rapid development and testing of individual features while maintaining a clear overall project timeline.

**3. Schedule Development**

3.1 **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** The WBS, detailed in the accompanying  `planning-artifacts/WBS.md` document, breaks down the project into manageable work packages.  Each work package is assigned to a responsible team member and includes detailed activity descriptions, effort estimations, and dependencies.  The WBS is dynamically updated throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in scope and priorities.

3.2 **Activity Sequencing:**  Activities are sequenced based on dependencies identified in the WBS.  Critical path analysis will be used to identify tasks that directly impact the project timeline.  This analysis will be performed using project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana, or MS Project) and regularly updated.

3.3 **Activity Duration Estimating:**  Activity durations are estimated using a combination of expert judgment, historical data (where available), and bottom-up estimation techniques.  The team will utilize time tracking software to monitor actual task durations and refine future estimations.  Estimates will be revisited at the end of each sprint/iteration to ensure accuracy.

3.4 **Schedule Development Tools:**  The project will utilize [Specify Project Management Software: e.g., Jira, Asana, MS Project] for schedule development, tracking, and reporting.  This software will facilitate task assignment, dependency management, critical path analysis, and progress monitoring.

**4. Schedule Control**

4.1 **Schedule Baseline:** A baseline schedule will be established upon completion of the initial planning phase.  This baseline will serve as a reference point for tracking progress and identifying deviations.  The baseline will be formally approved by stakeholders.

4.2 **Performance Measurement:**  Progress will be monitored using earned value management (EVM) techniques.  Regular progress meetings (e.g., daily stand-ups, weekly sprint reviews) will ensure timely identification of schedule variances.

4.3 **Change Control:**  A formal change control process will be implemented to manage changes to the project scope and schedule.  All change requests will be evaluated for their impact on the schedule and approved by the project manager and relevant stakeholders.  The project management software will track all change requests and their impact on the schedule.

4.4 **Schedule Updates:** The schedule will be updated regularly (e.g., weekly) to reflect actual progress and any approved changes.  These updates will be communicated to stakeholders through regular progress reports and meetings.

**5. Schedule Risk Management**

5.1 **Risk Identification:**  Potential schedule risks, such as delays in AI model training, unexpected technical challenges, or resource constraints, are identified and documented in the `management-plans/RiskManagementPlan.md` document.

5.2 **Risk Response Planning:**  Mitigation strategies are developed for each identified risk.  These strategies include contingency plans to address potential delays and resource allocation adjustments.

5.3 **Risk Monitoring and Control:**  Risks are monitored throughout the project lifecycle.  Contingency plans are implemented as needed to address any schedule disruptions.  Regular risk assessments will be performed to identify emerging risks.

**6. Schedule Reporting**

6.1 **Progress Reports:**  Regular progress reports (e.g., weekly) will be generated to track schedule performance, identify variances, and highlight potential issues.  These reports will include Gantt charts, burn-down charts, and other relevant visualizations.

6.2 **Stakeholder Communication:**  Schedule updates and any significant changes will be promptly communicated to stakeholders through reports, meetings, and other appropriate channels.

**7. Tools and Techniques**

- Project Management Software (e.g., Jira, Asana, MS Project)
- Gantt Charts
- Critical Path Method (CPM)
- Earned Value Management (EVM)
- Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban)
- Risk registers and mitigation plans


**8. Schedule Assumptions and Constraints**

-  The availability of Azure OpenAI resources.
-  The performance of the AI models used in the project.
-  The availability and expertise of the development team.
-  The adherence to the change control process.

**10.  Schedule Diagram**

*(A Gantt chart or other visual representation of the project schedule should be included here.  This would typically be generated by the project management software.)*


This Schedule Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect project progress and any necessary adjustments.  The project team will adhere to this plan to ensure the timely and successful completion of the ADPA project.
