# Work Breakdown Structure

## Project Overview

This project, "ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API," delivers a revolutionary platform for automating enterprise business analysis.  It generates BABOK v3 compliant frameworks in seconds, integrating with multiple AI providers and offering Fortune 500-grade deliverables. The WBS uses a decomposition approach focusing on major deliverables and phases, then breaking them down into manageable work packages.

## WBS Hierarchy

The following WBS utilizes a four-level hierarchy for clarity and manageability:

**1.0 Project: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent**

**1.1 Development of Core API & Infrastructure**

*   **1.1.1 API Development:**
    *   **1.1.1.1 Backend Development (Express.js, TypeScript):**  Includes API endpoints for document generation, template management, job management, and authentication.
    *   **1.1.1.2 API Testing and Quality Assurance:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing to ensure API functionality and stability.  Includes test case creation, execution, and defect resolution.
    *   **1.1.1.3 API Documentation (OpenAPI 3.0):** Generation and maintenance of comprehensive API documentation using TypeSpec and Swagger.
    *   **1.1.1.4 Deployment and Infrastructure Setup:** Setting up the API server, configuring deployment pipelines, and establishing monitoring systems.  Includes cloud provider selection and configuration (e.g., Azure).
*   **1.1.2 Database Design and Implementation:**  Design and implement a database (if applicable) to store templates, jobs, and user data.  Includes schema design, data modeling, and database migration strategies.
*   **1.1.3 Security Implementation:**  Implementation of robust security measures, including authentication (API keys, JWT), authorization, rate limiting, and input validation (Zod).  Includes security testing and penetration testing.
*   **1.1.4 Logging and Monitoring:**  Implementation of comprehensive logging and monitoring system to track API performance, errors, and security events.  Includes integration with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).


**1.2 AI Provider Integration and Model Selection**

*   **1.2.1 OpenAI API Integration:** Integrate with OpenAI's API for text generation and analysis capabilities.  Includes API key management, error handling, and performance optimization.
*   **1.2.2 Google AI Integration:** Integrate with Google AI's Gemini or other relevant models.  Includes API key management, error handling, and performance optimization.
*   **1.2.3 GitHub Copilot Integration (Optional):** Integrate with GitHub Copilot for code generation (if applicable).  Includes API key management and error handling.
*   **1.2.4 Ollama Integration (Optional):** Integrate with Ollama for large language model interaction (if applicable).  Includes API key management and error handling.
*   **1.2.5 Provider Selection Mechanism:** Implementation of a mechanism (e.g., CLI menu, configuration file) for selecting the preferred AI provider.  Includes fallback mechanisms and error handling.


**1.3 Template Creation and Management**

*   **1.3.1 BABOK v3 Template Development:** Create and maintain a comprehensive BABOK v3 compliant template for generating business analysis frameworks.
*   **1.3.2 PMBOK Template Development (Future):**  Develop templates for generating PMBOK-compliant project management documents.
*   **1.3.3 Template Management System:** Develop and implement a system for managing and versioning templates.  Includes API endpoints for creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving templates.
*   **1.3.4 Template Testing and Validation:**  Test and validate templates to ensure accurate and consistent output.


**1.4 Document Generation and Output**

*   **1.4.1 Document Generation Engine:** Develop the core engine responsible for generating documents from templates and AI-generated content.  Includes formatting, error handling, and multi-format output (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
*   **1.4.2 Output Formatting and Styling:**  Define and implement consistent formatting and styling for generated documents.
*   **1.4.3 Output Validation:** Implement validation to ensure generated documents adhere to specified standards (e.g., BABOK v3).


**1.5 User Interface and Documentation**

*   **1.5.1 CLI Development:** Develop a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the API.  Includes command parsing, argument handling, and error reporting.
*   **1.5.2 User Documentation:** Create comprehensive user documentation, including tutorials, FAQs, and troubleshooting guides.
*   **1.5.3 API Documentation:**  Maintain updated API documentation.


**1.6 Testing and Deployment**

*   **1.6.1 Automated Testing:** Implement automated testing for all aspects of the system, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
*   **1.6.2 Performance Testing:** Conduct performance testing to ensure scalability and responsiveness.
*   **1.6.3 Deployment Pipelines:** Establish robust CI/CD pipelines for continuous integration and deployment.
*   **1.6.4 Release Management:**  Define a release management process, including versioning and change control.


**1.7 Project Management**

*   **1.7.1 Project Planning:**  Create and maintain a project plan, including timelines, milestones, and resource allocation.
*   **1.7.2 Risk Management:** Identify and mitigate potential risks throughout the project lifecycle.
*   **1.7.3 Communication and Reporting:** Establish a communication plan and provide regular progress reports.



## Work Package Descriptions

A detailed description for each work package (1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, etc.) would be included in a separate document, outlining specific tasks, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and assigned resources.  This would include estimations for effort and duration.


## WBS Guidelines

*   **Decomposition Principles:**  The WBS uses a functional decomposition approach, breaking down the project based on its major functions and sub-functions.
*   **Level of Detail:** Four levels are used to provide sufficient detail for planning and execution without excessive complexity.
*   **Maintenance Procedures:**  The WBS will be updated regularly to reflect changes in project scope and progress.


This comprehensive WBS ensures complete project scope coverage, providing a detailed roadmap for development and implementation.  The level of detail in the work package descriptions would be further refined during project planning.
