# ADPA Coding Standards Guide

This guide outlines the coding standards and best practices for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Adherence to these standards is crucial for maintaining code quality, readability, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

**I. General Principles**

* **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project.  Inconsistency makes code harder to read and understand.
* **Readability:** Prioritize code readability.  Choose clear and concise variable and function names, use meaningful comments, and format your code consistently.
* **Maintainability:** Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend.  Avoid overly complex logic and ensure your code is well-documented.
* **Testability:** Write code that is easy to test.  Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions.
* **Efficiency:** Write efficient code that minimizes resource consumption.  Avoid unnecessary computations and optimize algorithms where appropriate.
* **Security:** Write secure code that protects against common vulnerabilities.  Validate user inputs, sanitize data, and use secure coding practices.


**II. Language-Specific Rules (TypeScript)**

ADPA is primarily written in TypeScript.  These rules apply to all TypeScript code within the project.

* **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* **Line Length:** Keep lines under 120 characters.
* **Semicolons:** Use semicolons at the end of statements.
* **Braces:** Place opening braces on the same line as the statement and closing braces on a new line aligned with the opening statement.
    ```typescript
    function myFunction(param1: string, param2: number): void {
        // Function body
    }
    ```
* **Spacing:** Use consistent spacing around operators and keywords.
* **Type Annotations:** Use type annotations for all variables, function parameters, and return values.
* **Interfaces vs. Types:** Use interfaces for describing the shape of objects and types for more flexible type aliases.
* **Enums:** Use enums for representing a set of named constants.
* **Generics:** Use generics to write reusable code that can work with different types.
* **Async/Await:** Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations.
* **Error Handling:** Use `try`/`catch` blocks to handle potential errors.  Avoid throwing generic `Error` objects; instead, create custom error classes with specific error messages.
* **Comments:** Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.  Use JSDoc style comments for documenting public APIs.

**III. Naming Conventions**

* **Variables:** Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `myVariable`, `userName`).
* **Functions:** Use camelCase for function names (e.g., `calculateTotal`, `processRequest`).
* **Classes:** Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., `UserManager`, `DocumentProcessor`).
* **Interfaces:** Use PascalCase for interface names (e.g., `UserInterface`, `DocumentInterface`).
* **Constants:** Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (e.g., `MAX_USERS`, `API_KEY`).
* **File Names:** Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-manager.ts`, `document-processor.ts`).


**IV. File Organization**

* **Modular Design:** Organize the code into well-defined modules and submodules. Each module should have a specific purpose and a well-defined API.
* **Directory Structure:** Follow a consistent directory structure.  The current structure (`generated-documents`, `src`, `tests`, etc.) should be maintained and expanded logically.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Separate concerns into different files and modules (e.g., data access, business logic, presentation).


**V. Code Documentation**

* **JSDoc:** Use JSDoc style comments to document all public APIs (classes, interfaces, functions).  Include descriptions, parameter types, return types, and examples.
* **Inline Comments:** Use inline comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious code.  Keep comments concise and to the point.


**VI. Error Handling**

* **Try-Catch Blocks:** Use `try`/`catch` blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
* **Custom Error Classes:** Create custom error classes to provide more informative error messages.
* **Logging:** Log errors to a central logging system (consider using a library like Winston).  Include relevant context information in the log messages (e.g., timestamps, user IDs, error messages).
* **Retry Mechanism:** Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., network errors, API timeouts).


**VII. Testing Requirements**

* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all functions and classes.  Aim for high test coverage (at least 80%).
* **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules and components.
* **End-to-End Tests:** Write end-to-end tests to verify the overall functionality of the system.
* **Testing Framework:** Use Jest as the testing framework.


**VIII. Performance Guidelines**

* **Profiling:** Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks.
* **Optimization:** Optimize algorithms and data structures to improve performance.
* **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations to avoid blocking the main thread.
* **Caching:** Use caching to reduce the number of expensive computations.


**IX. Security Guidelines**

* **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
* **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize all data before using it in your code.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.  Use Azure Active Directory for authentication where appropriate (as currently implemented).


**X. Code Review Process**

* **Peer Reviews:** All code must undergo peer review before merging into the main branch.
* **Review Checklist:** Use a checklist to ensure that all code reviews are thorough and consistent.
* **Code Quality Tools:** Use ESLint and other code quality tools to enforce coding standards.


**XI. Best Practices**

* **Keep it Simple:** Avoid overly complex code.  Break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks.
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication.  Use functions, classes, and other code reuse techniques to avoid redundancy.
* **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Keep your code simple and easy to understand.
* **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Don't add features that you don't need.
* **SOLID Principles:** Apply the SOLID principles of object-oriented design to write maintainable and extensible code.


**XII. Version Control (Git)**

* **Commit Messages:** Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made.
* **Branching Strategy:** Use a consistent branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).
* **Pull Requests:** Use pull requests to review code changes before merging them into the main branch.


This guide provides a comprehensive set of coding standards and best practices for the ADPA project.  By adhering to these standards, we can ensure that the codebase is of high quality, maintainable, and extensible.  Any deviations from these standards require justification and approval from the lead developer.
