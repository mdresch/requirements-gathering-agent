## ADPA Development Workflow Guide

This guide outlines the development workflow for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, encompassing processes for task management, code management, review, testing, documentation, release, communication, and tool usage.  This guide emphasizes best practices and leverages the project's existing structure and tools.

**I. Development Process:**

ADPA utilizes an iterative development methodology, incorporating Agile principles.  We employ a Kanban board (e.g., within GitHub Projects or a similar tool) for task management and tracking progress.  Tasks are broken down into small, manageable units, allowing for flexibility and rapid iteration.

**A. Task Management:**

1. **Task Creation:**  New tasks are created in the Kanban board, clearly describing the objective, acceptance criteria, and assigned developer.  Tasks should be linked to relevant issues or pull requests.
2. **Prioritization:** Tasks are prioritized based on business value, dependencies, and urgency.  The team lead facilitates prioritization discussions.
3. **Status Updates:** Developers update task status regularly (daily or as needed) to reflect progress.
4. **Blocking Issues:**  Any blocking issues are immediately reported and escalated as necessary.

**B. Code Management:**

1. **Branching Strategy:** We utilize Gitflow or a similar branching strategy.  Feature branches are created for each new feature or bug fix.  Main branch is protected and only accepts merged pull requests.
2. **Commit Messages:**  Commit messages should be clear, concise, and follow a consistent format (e.g., feat: , fix: , docs:).
3. **Pull Requests:** All code changes are submitted via pull requests, which undergo code review before merging.
4. **Code Style:**  Adhere to the established TypeScript coding style guide (ensure consistent formatting, naming conventions, and linting).

**C. Code Review Process:**

1. **Peer Review:** At least one other developer reviews each pull request.
2. **Review Checklist:**  Reviewers use a standardized checklist to ensure code quality, functionality, security, and adherence to coding standards.
3. **Feedback:**  Constructive feedback is provided promptly.  Authors address comments and concerns before merging.
4. **Approval:**  Pull requests require approval from at least one reviewer before merging.

**D. Testing Process:**

1. **Unit Tests:**  Developers write unit tests for their code, ensuring high test coverage.  Jest is the primary testing framework.
2. **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests verify the interaction between different components and modules.
3. **End-to-End Tests:**  End-to-end tests validate the entire system workflow.
4. **Test Automation:**  Testing should be automated as much as possible using CI/CD pipelines.
5. **Test Reporting:**  Comprehensive test reports are generated and reviewed.

**E. Documentation:**

1. **README.md:** The project README remains the central source of information for users.  It should be kept up-to-date.
2. **Internal Documentation:**  Maintain detailed internal documentation, including architecture diagrams, design specifications, and implementation guides.  Utilize Markdown extensively.
3. **API Documentation:**  Generate API documentation using tools like Typedoc.
4. **Knowledge Base:**  Create a knowledge base (e.g., Wiki or Confluence) for FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and best practices.
5. **Code Comments:**  Write clear and concise comments in the code to explain complex logic or non-obvious functionality.

**F. Release Process:**

1. **Versioning:**  Follow semantic versioning (SemVer) for releases.
2. **Release Notes:**  Create detailed release notes for each release, highlighting new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes.
3. **Deployment:**  Automate the deployment process using CI/CD pipelines.
4. **Testing:**  Thoroughly test releases before deployment to production.
5. **Rollback Plan:**  Have a rollback plan in place in case of issues.

**G. Communication:**

1. **Daily Stand-ups:**  Conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, roadblocks, and plan for the day.
2. **Weekly Meetings:**  Hold weekly meetings to review progress, address any major issues, and plan for the upcoming week.
3. **Communication Tools:**  Utilize tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or email for efficient communication.
4. **Issue Tracking:**  Use GitHub Issues for tracking and managing bugs and feature requests.


**II. Tools Usage:**

* **Git:** Version control.
* **GitHub:** Code repository, issue tracking, project management (Kanban board).
* **npm:** Package management.
* **Jest:** Unit and integration testing.
* **TypeScript:** Programming language.
* **Node.js:** Runtime environment.
* **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps):** Automated build, test, and deployment.
* **Markdown Editor:** Consistent documentation formatting.
* **Communication Platform (e.g., Slack, Teams):**  Facilitates team communication.


**III. Best Practices:**

* **Code Reviews:** Mandatory for all pull requests.
* **Testing:**  High test coverage is essential.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Automate the build, test, and deployment process.
* **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date and comprehensive documentation.
* **Communication:**  Maintain clear and consistent communication within the team.
* **Modular Design:**  Maintain the project's modular architecture for ease of maintenance and extension.


This guide provides a framework for the ADPA development workflow.  The team will adapt and refine this guide as needed based on experience and evolving project requirements.  Regular review and improvement of the workflow are crucial for maintaining efficiency and high-quality deliverables.
