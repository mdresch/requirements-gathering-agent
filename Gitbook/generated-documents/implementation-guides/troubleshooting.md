## ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) Troubleshooting Guide

This guide assists in troubleshooting issues encountered while using the ADPA tool.  It covers common problems, debugging techniques, and recovery steps.  Refer to the ADPA documentation for detailed information on usage and configuration.


**I. Common Issues & Resolutions:**

**A.  AI Provider Errors:**

1. **Symptom:**  Errors related to API keys, authentication, or rate limits from your chosen AI provider (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  Messages might include "Invalid API key," "Authentication failed," "Rate limit exceeded," or similar.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Check your `.env` file for correct API keys and endpoint URLs. Ensure the keys have the necessary permissions.
    * Verify network connectivity to the AI provider's API endpoint.  Use tools like `ping` or `curl` to test connectivity.
    * Monitor API usage to avoid exceeding rate limits.  The provider's documentation will specify limits and potential solutions.
    * Examine the ADPA logs for detailed error messages (see section IV. Logging).

3. **Resolution:**
    * Correct API keys and endpoints in the `.env` file.
    * Address network connectivity issues.
    * Reduce API calls or request smaller chunks of data to avoid rate limits.  Consider implementing retry logic (ADPA's `--with-retry` option).
    * Contact the AI provider's support if authentication or other persistent issues occur.


**B.  Context Management Issues:**

1. **Symptom:**  Documents are incomplete, inaccurate, or contain nonsensical information. This might stem from insufficient or incorrect context provided to the AI model.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Run `requirements-gathering-agent --context-report` to review the context manager's performance.
    * Inspect the `generated-documents` directory for any indication of missing or incomplete source files.
    * Check the relevance scores of discovered files using the project analysis output. Low scores indicate insufficient context.
    * Examine the ADPA logs for context-related warnings or errors.

3. **Resolution:**
    * Ensure comprehensive project documentation is available (README, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.).
    * Improve the quality and organization of your project documentation to increase relevance scores.
    * Use the `--use-large-context` option to force the usage of a larger context window (if your AI provider supports it).
    * Manually review and supplement the context if needed.


**C.  Document Generation Errors:**

1. **Symptom:**  Errors during document generation, such as "Failed to generate document," "Template error," or specific errors related to a particular document type.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Check the ADPA logs for specific error messages.
    * Inspect the relevant document template (located in the `src/modules/documentTemplates` directory) for potential issues.
    * Try generating individual documents using specific CLI commands (e.g., `requirements-gathering-agent --generate project-charter`).

3. **Resolution:**
    * Address any errors identified in the logs.
    * Correct issues in the document templates.
    * If a specific document type consistently fails, consider reporting the issue on the ADPA GitHub repository.


**D.  CLI Issues:**

1. **Symptom:**  The CLI commands fail to execute correctly, return unexpected results, or produce error messages.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Verify the ADPA installation (check version using `requirements-gathering-agent --version`).
    * Check that Node.js and npm are correctly installed and configured.
    * Ensure you are running the command from the correct directory.
    * Examine the CLI output for error messages.

3. **Resolution:**
    * Reinstall ADPA if necessary.
    * Update Node.js and npm to the latest versions.
    * Ensure you have the correct permissions to execute the CLI commands.
    * Consult the CLI help (`requirements-gathering-agent --help`) for correct usage.


**II. Error Messages:**

ADPA provides detailed error messages in the console output and log files.  These messages should pinpoint the source of the problem.  Look for specific error codes or descriptions to guide your troubleshooting.  If an error is unclear, include the full error message when reporting issues.

**III. Logging:**

ADPA logs events and errors to a log file (location specified in the configuration or default). Examine this log file for detailed information about errors, warnings, and other relevant events.  The log level can often be adjusted in the configuration.

**IV. Monitoring:**

While ADPA doesn't have built-in monitoring features, you can monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) of the process during execution.  Tools like `top` (Linux/macOS) or Task Manager (Windows) can be used to detect performance bottlenecks.

**V. Performance Issues:**

1. **Symptom:**  Slow document generation, high resource consumption, or timeouts.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network).
    * Check the AI provider's API response times.
    * Reduce the amount of context provided to the AI model.
    * Try generating individual documents to isolate performance bottlenecks.

3. **Resolution:**
    * Optimize your project documentation for relevance and conciseness.
    * Upgrade to a more powerful machine or improve network connectivity.
    * Use the `--core-only` option to generate only essential documents.
    * Consider using a faster AI model (if available).


**VI. Security Issues:**

1. **Symptom:**  Unauthorized access, data breaches, or vulnerabilities.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Review the ADPA security configuration.
    * Ensure your AI provider's API keys are securely stored and managed.
    * Regularly update ADPA and its dependencies.

3. **Resolution:**
    * Use strong API keys and secure storage mechanisms.
    * Keep ADPA and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Follow secure coding practices.


**VII. Network Issues:**

1. **Symptom:**  Connection errors, timeouts, or intermittent failures related to network connectivity.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Check network connectivity using `ping` or `curl`.
    * Examine the ADPA logs for network-related errors.

3. **Resolution:**
    * Address network connectivity issues.
    * Ensure the network is stable and has sufficient bandwidth.


**VIII. Database Issues:** (Not applicable to ADPA's current implementation, but relevant for future extensions)

This section would be populated if ADPA were to incorporate database storage in future versions.

**IX. Recovery Steps:**

1. **For minor issues:**  Restart ADPA.  Check logs for error messages and address them accordingly.
2. **For persistent issues:**  Review the troubleshooting steps above.  Check the GitHub repository for known issues and solutions.  If the problem persists, report the issue on the GitHub repository, providing detailed logs and steps to reproduce the error.


**X.  Version Control System (VCS) Issues:**

1. **Symptom:**  Errors related to the built-in VCS (Git).  Messages might include "Git command failed," "Repository not found," or similar.

2. **Debugging Tools:**
    * Verify that Git is correctly installed and configured on your system.
    * Ensure the `generated-documents` directory is accessible and not read-only.
    * Check the ADPA logs for Git-related errors.  
    * Examine the `generated-documents/.git` directory to ensure the repository is properly initialized.

3. **Resolution:**
    * Install Git if necessary.  
    * Configure Git correctly (user name, email).
    * Ensure the `generated-documents` directory has write permissions.
    * Delete the `.git` directory within `generated-documents` and re-run ADPA to re-initialize the repository.
    * Review the VCS documentation within ADPA's README for correct command usage.


This troubleshooting guide provides a starting point for resolving common issues.  Remember to always consult the ADPA documentation and GitHub repository for the most up-to-date information.
