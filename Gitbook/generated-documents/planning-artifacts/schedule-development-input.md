# Schedule Development Input for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

## 1. Project Management Plan Components

- **Scope Baseline**  
  The scope baseline includes the detailed project scope statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary. This defines all deliverables such as core PMBOK documents, management plans, technical analysis, and planning artifacts that must be scheduled.

- **Schedule Management Plan**  
  Defines the scheduling methodology, tools (e.g., MS Project, Azure DevOps), units of measure for time (e.g., hours, days), scheduling formats, and control thresholds. It also outlines schedule development policies, procedures, and the approach to managing schedule changes and baselines.

- **Cost Baseline**  
  Provides budget constraints and funding limits that impact schedule decisions, such as resource availability and procurement timelines.

- **Resource Management Plan**  
  Identifies resource availability and constraints, including human resources (e.g., developers, PMs), AI experts, and tooling requirements (e.g., Azure OpenAI access), which affect task scheduling.

- **Risk Management Plan**  
  Details known risks that may impact the schedule such as AI service availability, authentication delays, or dependency on external APIs. Inputs include risk mitigation and contingency plans.

- **Quality Management Plan**  
  Defines quality standards and acceptance criteria that may influence durations for reviews, testing, and approvals.

- **Communication Management Plan**  
  Specifies communication requirements, frequency, and channels to coordinate schedule-related information with stakeholders.

- **Procurement Management Plan**  
  Outlines procurement timelines for any third-party services or APIs (e.g., Azure OpenAI subscriptions, GitHub tokens) that could impact schedule milestones.

## 2. Activity List and Attributes

- A comprehensive list of all schedule activities identified from the WBS and planning artifacts, including activities like:

  - Requirements gathering and analysis  
  - AI integration development (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama)  
  - Documentation generation scripting  
  - Testing and validation of generated PMBOK documents  
  - Deployment and release of the npm package  
  - User acceptance and feedback incorporation  

- Each activity includes attributes such as predecessor/successor relationships, resource needs, constraints, and assumptions.

---

## 3. Milestone List

- Key milestones that mark significant points in the project schedule, for example:

  - Completion of core document generation module  
  - Integration with Azure OpenAI service completed  
  - Successful generation of all 28 PMBOK documents  
  - Release of version 1.0 on npm  
  - Full implementation of retry logic  
  - Documentation and user guide publication  

---

## 4. Project Schedule Network Diagrams

- Visual representations of activity sequences and dependencies, including:

  - Logical relationships among activities (Finish-to-Start, Start-to-Start, etc.)  
  - Parallel and critical path activities  
  - Identification of potential schedule bottlenecks or risks  

---

## 5. Resource Calendars

- Calendars indicating resource availability such as work hours, holidays, leaves, and planned downtime for:

  - Development team (e.g., Node.js developers, AI specialists)  
  - Project management and quality assurance teams  
  - External contributors or consultants  

---

## 6. Activity Duration Estimates

- Estimates of the time required to complete each activity, incorporating:

  - Historical data or expert judgment based on similar AI-powered documentation tools  
  - Consideration of complexity (e.g., AI model integration vs. documentation formatting)  
  - Allowances for quality reviews and testing cycles  

---

## 7. Project Staff Assignments

- Identification of specific team members or roles assigned to activities, e.g.:

  - Lead developer for AI integration  
  - PMBOK documentation expert for validation  
  - DevOps engineer for deployment  
  - QA team for testing generated documents  

---

## 8. Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)

- Influences external to the project, including:

  - Availability and performance of AI services (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama)  
  - Organizational scheduling standards and tools  
  - Market release timelines and competitive pressures  
  - Legal or compliance deadlines related to licensing or data security  

---

## 9. Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)

- Existing assets to be leveraged during scheduling, such as:

  - Previous project schedules and lessons learned from similar AI or Node.js projects  
  - Standard templates for schedule network diagrams and milestone lists  
  - Historical duration and resource availability data  
  - Organizational guidelines for schedule change control  

---

## 10. Assumptions and Constraints

- Assumptions impacting schedule development:

  - Continuous availability and stability of AI service APIs  
  - Team members’ skill levels and availability remain consistent  
  - No significant scope changes during schedule development  

- Constraints affecting schedule:

  - Node.js minimum version requirement (18.0.0 or higher) to be met before development  
  - Azure CLI and Entra ID authentication setup timelines  
  - External approval cycles for open-source contributions and licensing
