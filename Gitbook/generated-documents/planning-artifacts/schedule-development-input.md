## Schedule Development Input: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the inputs required for developing a project schedule for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  It leverages PMBOK guidelines and considers the project's unique aspects.

**1. Project Scope Statement:**

* **Project Goal:**  Generate a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from a project's README file using AI.
* **Deliverables:**  28 PMBOK documents categorized into Core Analysis, Project Charter, Management Plans, Planning Artifacts, Stakeholder Management, and Technical Analysis (as detailed in the README).  Specific documents include Project Charter, WBS, WBS Dictionary, Schedule Network Diagram, etc.  A master README file indexing all generated documents.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  All 28 documents are generated, accurately reflect the input README, adhere to PMBOK standards, and are correctly organized in the specified directory structure.  The generated documents are free of significant factual errors and are of a professional quality.
* **Exclusions:**  Manual review and editing of the generated documents (unless explicitly specified as a future enhancement).  Integration with other project management software beyond the generation of the documents themselves.

**2. Project Requirements:**

* **Functional Requirements:** The tool must accurately interpret the input README and translate its information into PMBOK-compliant documentation.  It must support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama). It must handle errors gracefully and offer retry mechanisms.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:** The tool should be efficient, reliable, secure, and user-friendly. It should produce professional-quality documents.  Performance benchmarks should be established to ensure acceptable processing times.

**3. Activity List:**

This section lists the tasks necessary for developing and deploying the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Durations are estimated and require further refinement based on resource availability and complexity.

| Task ID | Task Description                                      | Duration (Days) | Dependencies | Resources Required |

| T011    | Package and deploy the application                  | 1               | T010           | Developer, Ops      |
| T012    | Create and update documentation (README, etc.)       | 2               | T011           | Developer, PM       |


**4. Resource Calendar:**

* **Resources:** Project Manager (PM), Developers (2), QA Engineer, AI Expert (if needed for specialized AI tasks).
* **Availability:**  Define the availability of each resource (e.g., full-time, part-time, specific days).  Consider potential resource conflicts.

**5. Dependencies:**

The table above includes dependency information.  A more detailed dependency network diagram will be created using the activity list.

**6. Constraints:**

* **Time Constraints:**  Define a target project completion date.
* **Budget Constraints:**  Establish a budget for the project.
* **Resource Constraints:**  Consider limitations on resource availability.
* **Technical Constraints:**  Note any technological limitations or dependencies.

**7. Risk Register:**

A preliminary risk register should be created identifying potential risks (e.g., AI API limitations, integration challenges, testing delays) and mitigation strategies.

**8. Assumptions:**

The project assumes access to necessary AI APIs and sufficient resources.

**9.  Calendar:**  A standard calendar (e.g., 5-day work week) will be used.


This Schedule Development Input will be used to create a detailed project schedule using appropriate scheduling techniques (e.g., Critical Path Method).  Further refinement of the activity list, duration estimates, and resource allocation will be done during the schedule development process.  This will also inform the selection of suitable scheduling software.
