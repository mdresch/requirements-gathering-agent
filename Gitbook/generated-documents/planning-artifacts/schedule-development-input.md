# Schedule Development Input

The **Schedule Development** process involves analyzing activity sequences, durations, resource requirements, and schedule constraints to create a project schedule model. This section outlines all necessary inputs required to develop a robust and realistic project schedule for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.

---

## 1. Project Management Plan Components

The project management plan contains subsidiary plans and baselines essential for schedule development:

- **Schedule Management Plan**  
  Defines the criteria and the activities for developing, monitoring, and controlling the project schedule, including scheduling methodology, tools, format, units of measure, and reporting formats.

- **Scope Baseline**  
  Includes the project scope statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary. It establishes the work scope that must be scheduled.

- **Resource Management Plan**  
  Outlines human and material resource assignments, capability, availability, and constraints that influence scheduling.

- **Cost Baseline**  
  Provides budget constraints that may impact schedule decisions.

- **Risk Management Plan**  
  Details identified risks, their impact on the schedule, contingency reserves, and response strategies that may affect time estimates.

- **Quality Management Plan**  
  May impose quality-related milestones or inspections affecting schedule timing.

- **Procurement Management Plan**  
  Includes vendor delivery schedules and contract milestones that influence the project timeline.

- **Stakeholder Engagement Plan**  
  Provides insight into stakeholder availability and communication timing, which may impact scheduling.

---

## 2. Project Documents

- **Activity List**  
  A complete list of all schedule activities derived from the WBS, specifying each task to be scheduled.

- **Activity Attributes**  
  Detailed information about each activity including predecessors, successors, logical relationships, leads, lags, and constraints.

- **Milestone List**  
  Identifies important project milestones, including key deliverables and decision points that must be reflected in the schedule.

- **Project Schedule Network Diagrams**  
  Visual representations of activity sequencing and dependencies, critical for understanding workflow and constraints.

- **Resource Calendars**  
  Define the availability of human resources, equipment, and materials, including working days, shifts, holidays, and planned absences.

- **Project Team Assignments**  
  Documentation of roles and responsibilities that may affect resource scheduling and availability.

- **Risk Register**  
  Contains information on schedule risks including risk triggers, impact, probability, and planned responses that may affect duration estimates.

- **Agreements and Contracts**  
  Procurement documents that specify delivery dates and timing requirements for vendor-supplied goods and services.

---

## 3. Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)

Consider internal and external environmental conditions influencing schedule development:

- **Organizational Culture and Structure**  
  Influence decision-making speed and availability of resources.

- **Existing Project Management Information Systems (PMIS)**  
  Tools and scheduling software (e.g., MS Project, Primavera) available for schedule modeling.

- **Resource Availability**  
  Enterprise-wide resource capacity and constraints.

- **Market Conditions**  
  Vendor lead times and supply chain factors affecting procurement timing.

- **Government or Industry Standards**  
  Regulatory constraints that may impact schedule milestones.

- **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**  
  Previously developed schedules, templates, historical data, lessons learned, and schedule-related policies or procedures.

---

## 4. Agreements

- All contracts, memoranda of understanding, service level agreements, and procurement documents that contain schedule-related obligations and constraints.

---

## 5. Constraints and Assumptions

- **Constraints**  
  - Fixed deadlines or mandatory milestones (e.g., regulatory submission dates).  
  - Limited resource availability windows or capped budget impacting schedule flexibility.  
  - Technological dependencies (e.g., AI model availability or environment setup timelines).

- **Assumptions**  
  - Availability of AI service providers as planned (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  
  - Stable technology stack without significant changes during schedule execution.  
  - Timely delivery of external vendor services and resources.  
  - Adequate team capacity and productivity levels as estimated.

## Additional Considerations Specific to the Requirements Gathering Agent Project

- AI provider model selection and availability may affect activity durations (e.g., training or integration time for Azure OpenAI vs local Ollama).

- Authentication and security setup (Azure Entra ID, API keys) could impose schedule dependencies.

- Multi-provider fallback mechanisms require testing activities to be scheduled appropriately.

- Offline development environment setup for Ollama may introduce additional setup activities.

- Integration of generated PMBOK documentation as part of project deliverables with milestones aligned to schedule.
