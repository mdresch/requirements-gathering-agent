## Schedule Development Input: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the inputs required for developing a project schedule for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project, aligning with PMBOK Guide standards.

**1. Project Scope Statement:**  The project scope is defined by the README file and encompasses the development and delivery of a Node.js application that generates PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI (Azure OpenAI, with fallback options). This includes all features listed in the README, such as generating various document types, handling different AI providers, implementing robust error handling and retry mechanisms, and creating a well-organized output directory structure.  The project deliverables are the functional application and associated documentation (including this schedule).

**2. Project Requirements Documentation:** The requirements are detailed in the README file, including functional requirements (document generation, AI provider integration, error handling), non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, maintainability), and user stories (implied through the described functionality).  A more formal requirements document may be generated by the Requirements Gathering Agent itself during project execution, refining these initial specifications.

**3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A WBS will be created, decomposing the project into manageable work packages.  Example work packages could include:

* **1.0 Project Setup:**  Environment setup, dependency installation, initial project configuration.
* **2.0 API Integration:** Integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama APIs.  This will be further broken down by API provider.
* **3.0 Document Generation Logic:** Development of the core logic for generating each PMBOK document type.  Each document type will be a sub-task.
* **4.0 Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Implementation of robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
* **5.0 Output Directory Management:** Creation of the structured output directory.
* **6.0 Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Development and testing of the CLI for user interaction.
* **7.0 Testing and Quality Assurance:** Unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing.
* **8.0 Documentation:** Creation of updated documentation including user guides and API documentation.
* **9.0 Deployment:** Deployment to npm registry.


**4. Activity List:**  Based on the WBS, a detailed activity list will be created.  Each activity will include:

* **Activity ID:** Unique identifier for each activity.
* **Activity Description:** Clear and concise description of the work involved.
* **Predecessor Activities:** Activities that must be completed before this activity can begin.
* **Successor Activities:** Activities that can begin only after this activity is completed.


**5. Activity Duration Estimates:**  Each activity will have an estimated duration assigned, considering factors such as complexity, resource availability, and historical data (if available).  These estimates can be in hours, days, or weeks, depending on the project's scale.  Three-point estimating (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) may be used to account for uncertainty.

**6. Resource Requirements:**  The resources needed for each activity will be identified, including:

* **Human Resources:** Developers, testers, project manager.  Skills and availability of each resource will be considered.
* **Hardware Resources:** Development machines, testing environments.
* **Software Resources:** Development tools, testing frameworks, AI API access.

**7. Calendar:**  A project calendar will be defined, specifying working days, holidays, and other non-working days.  This calendar will be used to calculate the project schedule.

**8. Constraints:**  Any constraints that may affect the schedule will be identified and documented.  Examples include:

* **Deadlines:** Release date, presentation deadlines.
* **Resource Availability:** Limited availability of specific developers or testers.
* **Budget Constraints:**  Limitations on the total project budget.

**9. Assumptions:**  Assumptions made during schedule development will be clearly stated.  Examples include:

* Availability of necessary AI APIs.
* Sufficient expertise of the development team.
* No major unforeseen technical challenges.

**10. Project Management Software:** A project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana, Microsoft Project) will be selected to manage the project schedule and track progress.


This comprehensive schedule development input will enable the creation of a realistic and achievable project schedule for the Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensuring successful delivery within defined constraints.  The schedule will be iteratively refined and updated throughout the project lifecycle.
