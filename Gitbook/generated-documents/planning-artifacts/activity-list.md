## Notes  
1. **Activity IDs**: These IDs are structured to reflect the project phase and sequence (e.g., 2.1 refers to Planning Phase, Activity 1).  
2. **WBS References**: WBS references align with the work packages defined in the Work Breakdown Structure document.  
3. **Level of Detail**: Activities are sufficiently detailed to enable effective planning, execution, and monitoring without being overly granular.  

This Activity List serves as the foundation for scheduling, resource allocation, and progress monitoring, ensuring the successful delivery of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.
