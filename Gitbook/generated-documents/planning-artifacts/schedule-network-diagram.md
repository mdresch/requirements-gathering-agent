## Network Analysis

### **Critical Path Analysis**
- **Critical Path Activities**:  
  - Develop Project Charter → Identify Stakeholders → Conduct Initial Planning → Requirements Gathering → Architecture & Design → Resource Planning → Risk Assessment → Development → Testing → Integration → Deployment → Final Deliverable Acceptance → Project Closure Documentation.  

- **Critical Path Duration**: 45 days.  
- **Near-Critical Paths**: Activities with minimal float, such as Risk Monitoring and Change Control.  
- **Schedule Risk**: Potential delays in Requirements Gathering and Development tasks may impact the critical path.

---

### **Float Analysis**
- **Total Float**:  
  - Activities not on the critical path have a float of up to 2 days.  
- **Free Float**:  
  - Testing and Quality Assurance: 1 day.  
- **Project Float**:  
  - Buffer time of 3 days for Monitoring & Control activities.

## Schedule Optimization
1. **Schedule Compression**:  
   - **Fast Tracking**: Begin Testing & QA parallel to Development tasks.  
   - **Crashing**: Allocate additional resources to Requirements Gathering and Development tasks.

2. **Resource Leveling**:  
   - Adjust activities competing for resources during the Planning Phase.

3. **Schedule Baseline**:  
   - Approved baseline schedule for performance measurement.

4. **Change Control**:  
   - Process for managing schedule changes documented in Monitoring & Control phase.
