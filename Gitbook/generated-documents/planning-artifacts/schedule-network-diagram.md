## Schedule Network Diagram for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the project schedule using the Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM).  Durations are estimates and should be refined during detailed planning.  This diagram focuses on high-level activities; a more granular schedule will be developed in subsequent phases.

### Network Diagram Overview

**Diagramming Method:** Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)

**Project Phases:** The project is divided into five major phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring & Control, and Closure.  These phases are sequentially dependent, with some activities within phases running concurrently.

**Critical Path:** The critical path will be determined after detailed activity durations are estimated and the network is fully developed.  This initial diagram highlights potential critical path activities.

**Schedule Constraints:**  Key constraints include release deadlines, stakeholder availability for reviews, and resource limitations (AI API call limits).


### Activity Network Structure

The following table details the activities, their dependencies, and duration estimates.  Dependencies are represented using the Finish-to-Start (FS) relationship unless otherwise specified.  Durations are in days.


| Activity ID | Activity Description                     | Duration (Days) | Predecessors | Successors | Dependency Type | Notes                                      |

**Note:**  Activities 4 and 5 (Requirements Gathering and System Design) can potentially run partially in parallel, but there's a dependency to finalize requirements before detailed design can be completed.


### Network Diagram Representation

A visual representation (using a diagramming tool like MS Project, Lucidchart, or draw.io) is highly recommended for a clearer understanding of the network.  The above table provides the data necessary to create such a diagram.

**Simplified ASCII Representation (Illustrative Only):**

```
[1] --> [2] --> [3] --> [4] --> [6] --> [7] --> [8] --> [9] --> [10] --> [11] --> [12] --> [End]
       \                                                                                               /
        \_________________________________________________[5]_______________________________________________/
```

This simplified representation does not show the full complexity of dependencies and parallel tasks. A proper PDM diagram is crucial for accurate scheduling and risk assessment.


### Network Analysis

**Critical Path Analysis:**  The critical path will be identified once durations are finalized.  Potential critical path activities are those with the longest durations and fewest parallel paths (e.g., Development & Implementation).

**Float Analysis:** Float analysis will be performed after the critical path is identified to determine the amount of schedule flexibility for each activity.

### Schedule Optimization

Schedule optimization techniques like fast-tracking (overlapping activities) and crashing (reducing activity durations) may be considered if necessary to meet deadlines. Resource leveling will also be implemented to avoid resource conflicts.  A schedule baseline will be established upon approval of the detailed schedule.  A formal change control process will be followed for any schedule modifications.


This schedule network diagram provides a high-level overview.  A more detailed schedule with specific task breakdowns, resource assignments, and refined duration estimates will be developed in the subsequent planning phase.  This detailed schedule will then be used to create a more precise network diagram for detailed analysis and risk assessment.
