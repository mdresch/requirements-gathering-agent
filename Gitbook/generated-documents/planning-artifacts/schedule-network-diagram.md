# Schedule Network Diagram

## Network Diagram Overview

### Diagramming Method
- **Method**: Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)  
- **Purpose**: Represents project activities and their dependencies to visualize the flow of work and determine the critical path.

### Project Phases
The project is divided into five major phases:
1. **Initiation**
2. **Planning**
3. **Execution**
4. **Monitoring & Control**
5. **Closing**

Each phase contains multiple activities with logical relationships. 

### Critical Path
- **Definition**: The sequence of activities that determines the shortest possible project duration.
- **Identification**: Activities with zero float.
- **Impact**: Delays in any critical path activity will delay the project completion.

### Schedule Constraints
- **Key Dates**:  
  - Project kickoff: Day 1  
  - Planning complete: Day 20  
  - Execution start: Day 21  
  - Final project delivery: Day 60  

- **Milestones**:  
  - Completion of stakeholder identification  
  - Approval of the project charter  
  - Completion of architecture design  
  - Deployment readiness

## Activity Network Structure

### **Project Initiation Phase**
#### Activities:
1. **Create Project Charter**  
   - **Duration**: 3 days  
   - **Dependency**: None (Start activity)  
   - **Start-to-Finish Relationship**: Determines scope initiation.

2. **Identify Stakeholders**  
   - **Duration**: 2 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Create Project Charter."

3. **Initial Planning Activities**  
   - **Duration**: 5 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Identify Stakeholders."

---

### **Planning Phase Activities**
#### Activities:
1. **Gather Requirements**  
   - **Duration**: 7 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Initial Planning Activities."

2. **Analyze Requirements**  
   - **Duration**: 5 days  
   - **Dependency**: Start-to-Start (SS) with "Gather Requirements."

3. **Develop Architecture Design**  
   - **Duration**: 10 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Finish (FF) with "Analyze Requirements."

4. **Resource Planning**  
   - **Duration**: 4 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Develop Architecture Design."

5. **Perform Risk Assessment**  
   - **Duration**: 4 days  
   - **Dependency**: Start-to-Start (SS) with "Resource Planning."

---

### **Execution Phase Activities**
#### Activities:
1. **Develop Core System**  
   - **Duration**: 15 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Perform Risk Assessment."

2. **Test and QA**  
   - **Duration**: 7 days  
   - **Dependency**: Start-to-Start (SS) with "Develop Core System."

3. **Integrate Components**  
   - **Duration**: 5 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Finish (FF) with "Test and QA."

4. **Prepare for Deployment**  
   - **Duration**: 3 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Integrate Components."

---

### **Monitoring & Control Activities**
#### Activities:
1. **Monitor Progress**  
   - **Duration**: Ongoing  
   - **Dependency**: Parallel (can start anytime after "Develop Architecture Design").

2. **Perform Quality Control**  
   - **Duration**: 5 days  
   - **Dependency**: Start-to-Start (SS) with "Test and QA."

3. **Log Change Requests**  
   - **Duration**: 2 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Finish (FF) with "Perform Quality Control."

---

### **Closing Phase Activities**
#### Activities:
1. **Finalize Deliverables**  
   - **Duration**: 4 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Start (FS) with "Prepare for Deployment."

2. **Capture Lessons Learned**  
   - **Duration**: 3 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Finish (FF) with "Finalize Deliverables."

3. **Release Resources**  
   - **Duration**: 2 days  
   - **Dependency**: Finish-to-Finish (FF) with "Capture Lessons Learned."

## Network Analysis

### Critical Path Analysis
- **Critical Path Activities**:  
  [Create Project Charter] → [Identify Stakeholders] → [Initial Planning Activities] → [Gather Requirements] → [Develop Core System] → [Prepare for Deployment] → [Finalize Deliverables]  
- **Critical Path Duration**: 60 days.  
- **Near-Critical Paths**:  
  Path with activities such as "Perform Risk Assessment" and "Analyze Requirements."  
- **Schedule Risk**: Any delay in critical path activities will directly impact the project timeline.

---

### Float Analysis
- **Total Float**: Activities "Perform Quality Control" and "Capture Lessons Learned" have a free float of 2 days.  
- **Free Float**: Parallel activities like "Monitor Progress" have flexibility and minimal dependencies.  
- **Resource Conflicts**: Testing and QA may cause bottlenecks without proper resource allocation.

## Network Diagram Representation

### ASCII Network Diagram
```
[Start] -> [Create Project Charter] -> [Identify Stakeholders] -> [Initial Planning Activities]
            -> [Gather Requirements] -> [Analyze Requirements] -> [Develop Architecture Design]
            -> [Resource Planning] -> [Perform Risk Assessment] -> [Develop Core System]
            -> [Test and QA] -> [Integrate Components] -> [Prepare for Deployment]
            -> [Finalize Deliverables] -> [Capture Lessons Learned] -> [End]
```

### Detailed Activity Nodes
Each activity box contains:
- **Activity ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., A1, A2, A3).  
- **Activity Name**: Description of the task.  
- **Duration Estimate**: Time allocated for the activity.  
- **Early Start/Early Finish**: Calculated start and finish dates based on dependencies.  
- **Late Start/Late Finish**: Latest possible start and finish dates without delaying the project.  
- **Total Float**: Buffer time available for the activity.

## Schedule Optimization

### Compression Techniques
1. **Fast Tracking**: Parallelizing activities like "Analyze Requirements" and "Develop Architecture Design."  
2. **Crashing**: Allocate additional resources to reduce the duration of critical activities like "Develop Core System."

### Resource Leveling
- Adjust activities "Test and QA" and "Integrate Components" to prevent overloading shared resources.

### Schedule Baseline
- The approved project schedule will act as a baseline for monitoring and tracking project progress.

### Change Control
- A formal process for approving, rejecting, and implementing schedule adjustments will be established.
