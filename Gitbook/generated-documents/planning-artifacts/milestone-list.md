**Milestone Criteria:**  Each milestone will have clearly defined success criteria, target dates, responsible parties, and dependencies.

**Stakeholder Approval:** Milestones requiring formal sign-off are identified, along with the relevant stakeholders.

**Schedule Integration:** Milestones are integrated into the overall project schedule and critical path, informing project tracking and reporting.


### Project Phase Milestones

### Milestone Monitoring and Control

Milestone performance will be tracked against the project schedule using appropriate project management software.  Regular reports will highlight progress, variances, and potential risks.  A risk register will be maintained to identify and mitigate potential delays.

### Stakeholder Communication

Regular milestone reports will be communicated to stakeholders.  Any potential milestone slippage will be escalated through established communication channels, and lessons learned will be documented after each milestone completion.


This milestone list provides a high-level overview. A detailed schedule with specific dates, responsibilities, and risk assessments will be developed and maintained as part of the project management plan.
