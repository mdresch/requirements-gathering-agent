# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Requirements Gathering Agent Project  

## Introduction  
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the work required to complete the Requirements Gathering Agent project. It ensures that all aspects of the project are accounted for, following PMBOK guidelines and the 100% rule. The WBS is structured to allow effective planning, monitoring, and control of project deliverables and activities. It is organized by major project phases and deliverables, with work packages that are estimable, manageable, and independent.  

This WBS will be used as the foundation for defining project scope, estimating costs, allocating resources, scheduling activities, and tracking progress.
