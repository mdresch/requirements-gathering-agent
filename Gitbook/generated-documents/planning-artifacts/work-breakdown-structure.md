# Notes:  
- Each work package can be further decomposed into tasks and activities during detailed planning.  
- Dependencies between packages (e.g., Requirements Gathering → AI Integration → Document Generation) need to be managed during scheduling.  
- Quality and risk management are embedded throughout the lifecycle.
