**Note:**  This WBS provides a high-level overview. Each work package can be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable tasks as needed.  For example, "2.1.1 API Integration (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama)" could be broken down into individual tasks for each API provider.  The level of detail will depend on the project's complexity and the team's needs.  This WBS also assumes a certain level of existing infrastructure and tools.  Further decomposition might be required based on the specifics of the development environment.
