# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

## Introduction

The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the work required to successfully complete the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. It follows the PMBOK 7.0 standards and adheres to the 100% rule, ensuring all project deliverables and work activities are accounted for. This WBS serves as a foundation for planning, scheduling, budgeting, and tracking the progress of the project. 

The WBS is organized into three levels: **Project Phases**, **Major Deliverables**, and **Work Packages**. Each work package is designed to be independent, manageable, estimable, and clearly defined.
