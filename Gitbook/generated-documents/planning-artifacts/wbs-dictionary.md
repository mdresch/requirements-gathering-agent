## WBS Dictionary for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed descriptions for each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) element identified in the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The WBS itself would be a hierarchical structure, but this dictionary focuses on the individual components.  The numbering system reflects a potential hierarchical structure (though the exact structure would depend on the chosen methodology).
