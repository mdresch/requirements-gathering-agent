# WBS Dictionary: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed information for each work package identified in the Requirements Gathering Agent project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  The WBS is assumed to be hierarchical, reflecting the project's phases and deliverables.  Due to the complexity and iterative nature of software development, a fully detailed WBS and dictionary would be extensive.  This example provides a representative sample, focusing on key areas.

**Note:**  WBS IDs are illustrative and should be adjusted to reflect your actual WBS structure.
