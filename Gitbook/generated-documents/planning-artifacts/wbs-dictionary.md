## WBS Dictionary: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This WBS Dictionary provides detailed information for each element of the Requirements Gathering Agent project's Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).  It adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards, incorporating descriptions, deliverables, acceptance criteria, resource assignments, scheduling information, quality requirements, cost estimates, and risk considerations.  Note that cost and duration estimates are preliminary and subject to revision during detailed planning.

**Note:**  The following WBS Dictionary uses a simplified numbering scheme for brevity. In a real-world project, a more detailed and comprehensive coding system would be employed.
