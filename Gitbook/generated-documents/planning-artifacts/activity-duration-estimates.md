## Activity Duration Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

### 1. Overview

This document provides activity duration estimates for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  The estimates are based on a combination of expert judgment, analogous estimating (comparing to similar past projects), and the three-point estimating technique (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic).  The primary goal is to create a realistic project schedule, accounting for potential risks and uncertainties.

**Scope:** This estimation covers key activities across all project phases, from initial planning to deployment and post-launch support.

**Methodology:**  The three-point estimating technique (PERT) will be used to calculate the expected duration for each activity.  This technique accounts for uncertainty by considering optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic durations.  Expected duration is calculated as:  `(Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6`.

**Assumptions and Constraints:**

* Development team consists of 3 experienced developers and 1 project manager.
* Access to necessary infrastructure and tools is readily available.
* No major unforeseen technical challenges are anticipated.
* Stakeholder availability for reviews and approvals is consistent.
* The chosen AI provider's API remains stable and performs as expected.

**Review and Approval Process:**  This estimate will be reviewed and approved by the project manager and key stakeholders before being integrated into the project schedule.


### 2. Estimation Methodology

**Estimation Techniques:**

* **Expert Judgment:**  Leveraging the experience and knowledge of the development team to estimate activity durations.
* **Analogous Estimating:** Comparing the current project to similar past projects to derive estimates.
* **Three-Point Estimating (PERT):**  Considering optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic durations to account for uncertainty.


**Historical Data Sources and Benchmarks:**  Past project data from similar AI-based development projects will be used to inform analogous estimates.

**Resource Productivity Factors:**  Estimates account for the skill levels of the development team and potential productivity variations.

**Quality and Complexity Considerations:** The estimates incorporate considerations for code quality, testing rigor, and the complexity of integrating with multiple AI providers.
