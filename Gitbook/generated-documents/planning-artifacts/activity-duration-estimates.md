# Activity Duration Estimates

## Overview

### Purpose and Scope of Duration Estimation
This document provides a comprehensive estimation of activity durations for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. The purpose is to establish realistic timelines for project activities based on PMBOK guidelines, ensuring accurate planning, scheduling, and resource allocation.

### Estimation Methodology and Approach
The estimation methodology combines **expert judgment**, **analogous estimation**, **parametric estimation**, and **three-point estimation** techniques. Historical data, benchmarks, resource productivity, and complexity factors are incorporated to ensure robust estimates.

### Assumptions and Constraints
- Resource availability is assumed to be consistent throughout the project lifecycle.
- Historical data from comparable projects is accurate and relevant.
- Estimations account for potential risks and uncertainties but exclude external disruptions (e.g., regulatory delays).
- Dependencies between activities are clearly defined, with no overlapping tasks unless explicitly stated.

### Review and Approval Process
Duration estimates will be reviewed by the **Project Manager** in collaboration with key stakeholders (e.g., Technical Lead, Business Analyst, QA Lead) and formally approved during the planning phase.

## Estimation Methodology

### Estimation Techniques Used
- **Expert Judgment**: Leveraging insights from experienced team members (e.g., developers, architects, QA personnel).
- **Analogous Estimation**: Comparing activities to similar tasks completed in prior projects.
- **Parametric Estimation**: Calculating durations based on measurable parameters (e.g., lines of code per hour, test cases per day).
- **Three-Point Estimation**: Using optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic scenarios to calculate expected durations.

### Historical Data Sources and Benchmarks
- Previous project documentation for similar AI-powered tools.
- Industry-standard benchmarks for Node.js/TypeScript development and Azure integration.
  
### Resource Productivity Factors
- Productivity rates based on skill levels of team members (e.g., Senior Developer: 50 lines/hour; Junior Developer: 25 lines/hour).
- Adjustments for resource availability and competing priorities.

### Quality and Complexity Considerations
- High-quality deliverables require iterative reviews, which add time to activities.
- Complexity factors include integration with multiple AI providers, PMBOK compliance, and CLI implementation.
