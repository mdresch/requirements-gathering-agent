## Comprehensive Activity Duration Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document provides detailed activity duration estimates using three-point estimation (Optimistic, Most Likely, Pessimistic) and PERT calculations, incorporating relevant factors like resource availability, risk, and historical data.  Estimates are provided in days.

**Note:**  These estimates are initial assessments and should be refined through expert judgment and stakeholder review.  Contingency buffers are recommended for critical path activities.  Assumptions and constraints are noted for each activity.

| Activity ID | Activity Name                                  | Optimistic (O) | Most Likely (M) | Pessimistic (P) | Expected Duration (E) | Confidence Level (%) | Probability Distribution (PERT) | Resource Productivity Factor | Resource Availability Factor | Assumptions/Constraints                                                                        | Risk Factors                                                                         | Buffer Recommendation (Days) |
