## Activity Duration Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document outlines the duration estimates for key activities in the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project using three-point estimation (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic).  The estimates are in *days*.  These are high-level estimates and would need further refinement during detailed project planning.

**Three-Point Estimation Formula:**  (Optimistic + 4 * Most Likely + Pessimistic) / 6

**Activity List and Estimates:**

**Total Estimated Project Duration:**  The sum of the estimated durations for all activities (excluding A9, which is highly variable) is approximately **52.6 days**.  The inclusion of A9 (System Design & Development) would significantly increase the total project duration depending on its complexity.

**Risk Assessment:**  These estimates assume no major unforeseen delays or issues.  A thorough risk assessment should be performed to identify potential risks and their impact on the project schedule.  Contingency time should be added to the schedule to account for these risks.

**Note:** This is a high-level estimate.  A detailed Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with more granular activities is necessary for more precise duration estimation.  Using Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques during project execution will allow for tracking progress against this baseline and adjusting the schedule as needed.
