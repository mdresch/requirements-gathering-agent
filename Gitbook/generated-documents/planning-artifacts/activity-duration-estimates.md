# Activity Duration Estimates  

## Overview  

### Purpose and Scope of Duration Estimation  
This document provides a comprehensive estimate of activity durations for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. The estimates cover all major project phases, including development, project management, quality assurance, infrastructure setup, and training activities. The goal is to ensure realistic scheduling and resource allocation while meeting project objectives and stakeholder expectations.  

### Estimation Methodology and Approach  
Duration estimates are created using a combination of expert judgment, historical data analysis, analogous estimation, parametric estimation, and three-point estimation techniques. The estimates are aligned with PMBOK best practices and consider resource productivity, complexity, and quality requirements.  

### Assumptions and Constraints  
- Estimates assume optimal resource availability and skill levels.  
- Dependencies between activities are accounted for in the schedule.  
- No major disruptions (e.g., infrastructure delays or resource unavailability) are anticipated.  
- Project tools and technologies are fully operational and accessible.  

### Review and Approval Process  
Duration estimates are reviewed by the project manager, development lead, and other relevant stakeholders. Approval is obtained before integrating the estimates into the project schedule.

## Estimation Methodology  

### Estimation Techniques Used  
1. **Expert Judgment**: Input from experienced team members and subject matter experts.  
2. **Analogous Estimation**: Comparison with similar projects completed in the past.  
3. **Parametric Estimation**: Use of formulas and resource productivity rates.  
4. **Three-Point Estimation**: Calculation of expected duration using PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique).  

### Historical Data Sources and Benchmarks  
- Previous AI-driven project documentation tools.  
- Industry benchmarks for PMBOK-compliant documentation generation.  
- Historical data on TypeScript development and Azure OpenAI integration.  

### Resource Productivity Factors  
- Developers are estimated to produce approximately 350 lines of code/day.  
- QA team can complete 20 test cases/day.  
- Documentation tasks average 5 pages/day for technical writers.  

### Quality and Complexity Considerations  
Higher complexity activities (e.g., AI integration) are assigned longer durations due to potential difficulties. Quality assurance tasks involve rigorous review and validation processes, adding time to the estimates.
