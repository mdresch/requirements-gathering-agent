## Activity Resource Estimates for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This document details the resource estimates for the activities involved in developing and deploying the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  We'll use a combination of effort-based and resource-based estimating techniques, factoring in potential risks and uncertainties.  The estimates are presented in person-days (PD) and assume a standard 8-hour workday.

**I. Project Phase Breakdown & Activities:**

The project can be broken down into several phases:

**A. Requirements & Design (2 weeks):**

* **Activity 1:  Define Project Scope & Objectives (2 PD):**  Requires a senior project manager (SPM) to clarify scope, objectives, and deliverables.
* **Activity 2:  Detailed Requirements Gathering (4 PD):**  Requires a business analyst (BA) to gather detailed requirements from stakeholders.  Includes interviews, document reviews, and workshops.
* **Activity 3:  System Design & Architecture (4 PD):**  Requires a senior software architect (SSA) and a software engineer (SE) to design the system architecture, database schema, and API interfaces.
* **Activity 4:  UI/UX Design (4 PD):**  Requires a UI/UX designer to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes for the user interface.


**B. Development (4 weeks):**

* **Activity 5:  Backend Development (20 PD):**  Requires two experienced software engineers (SE) to develop the backend components, including API integration with AI providers.
* **Activity 6:  Frontend Development (16 PD):**  Requires one experienced frontend engineer (FE) to develop the user interface and integrate with the backend.
* **Activity 7:  AI Model Integration (12 PD):**  Requires one SE specializing in AI/ML integration to integrate with Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.  This includes handling authentication, error handling, and efficient API calls.
* **Activity 8: Unit & Integration Testing (12 PD):** Requires two SEs to perform thorough testing of individual components and their integration.


**C. Testing & Deployment (1 week):**

* **Activity 9:  System Testing (8 PD):**  Requires one QA engineer (QA) to perform comprehensive system testing, including functional, performance, and security testing.
* **Activity 10:  Deployment & Documentation (4 PD):**  Requires a DevOps engineer (DE) and a technical writer (TW) to deploy the application and create final documentation.


**D. Project Management & Oversight (Throughout the Project):**

* **Project Management (24 PD):**  Requires a SPM to manage the project, track progress, manage risks, and communicate with stakeholders.  This includes meetings, reporting, and issue resolution.


**II. Resource Calendar & Availability:**

The following table summarizes the resource availability and allocation:

**III. Cost Estimates:**

Cost estimates will depend on the hourly/daily rates for each resource.  This table would then be expanded to include cost per activity and total project cost.  (This requires specific rate information which is not provided).


**IV. Risk Assessment:**

Several risks could impact the resource estimates:

* **AI API Availability:**  Downtime or rate limits of AI providers could delay development.
* **Resource Availability:**  Unexpected unavailability of key personnel could impact timelines.
* **Complexity of Integration:**  Integrating with multiple AI providers might be more complex than anticipated.
* **Unforeseen Technical Challenges:**  Unexpected bugs or technical difficulties could require additional resources.

Mitigation strategies should be developed for each of these risks.


**V. Conclusion:**

This document presents a preliminary estimate of resources required for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  Regular monitoring and updates to these estimates will be necessary throughout the project lifecycle to account for changing circumstances and to ensure accurate resource allocation.  A detailed cost estimate will be provided once the resource rates are finalized.
