## 1. Risk Management Summary

### Risk Assessment Scale

**Probability Scale:**  
- **Very Low (1)**: 1-10% chance of occurrence
- **Low (2)**: 11-30% chance of occurrence  
- **Medium (3)**: 31-50% chance of occurrence
- **High (4)**: 51-70% chance of occurrence
- **Very High (5)**: 71-90% chance of occurrence

**Impact Scale:**  
- **Very Low (1)**: Minimal impact on project objectives
- **Low (2)**: Minor impact, easily manageable
- **Medium (3)**: Moderate impact, requires attention  
- **High (4)**: Significant impact, major management required
- **Very High (5)**: Severe impact, project success threatened

**Risk Score = Probability Ã— Impact**  
- **1-5**: Low Risk (Monitor)
- **6-10**: Medium Risk (Manage)  
- **11-15**: High Risk (Immediate Action)
- **16-25**: Critical Risk (Escalate)
