# Schedule Network Diagram

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This schedule network diagram provides a high-level visual representation of the key tasks and dependencies involved in the development and release of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) software.  Due to the iterative and AI-driven nature of the project, precise durations are difficult to estimate.  This diagram focuses on major milestones and dependencies.  Actual task durations and sequencing may vary based on AI model performance and resource availability.


**Key:**

* **Node:** Represents a task or milestone.
* **Arrow:** Indicates a dependency (the task at the arrow's head cannot start until the task at the arrow's tail is complete).
* **Duration:**  Estimated duration (in weeks, approximate and subject to change).  "Iterative" denotes an ongoing process.
