## System Design Specification: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the system design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), an AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive project management documentation based on project context.  ADPA leverages large language models (LLMs) from multiple providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to produce PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents and strategic business communications.  This design emphasizes modularity, scalability, and robust error handling.

**2. System Overview**

ADPA is a command-line interface (CLI) application built using Node.js and TypeScript. It performs the following key functions:

* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Analyzes project documentation (README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.) to extract relevant information.  It scores sources based on relevance to PMBOK terminology and project management concepts.
* **Enhanced Context Management:** Employs a three-phase context strategy to optimize context size for different LLMs, maximizing context utilization while avoiding token overflow.
* **Document Generation:**  Generates a suite of PMBOK-compliant documents and strategic business communications (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, Purpose Statement, Company Values) using LLMs.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK standards, providing quality scores and recommendations.
* **Version Control:** Maintains a local Git repository for generated documents, enabling version tracking and history management.
* **Multi-Provider Support:**  Supports multiple AI providers, allowing users to select their preferred service or leverage a fallback mechanism.


**3. System Architecture**

ADPA follows a modular, layered architecture:

* **User Interface (UI) Layer:** The CLI provides user interaction, accepting commands and parameters.
* **Application Logic Layer:** This layer orchestrates the overall workflow, managing context, calling AI providers, and handling document generation and validation.
* **Data Access Layer:** This layer handles interactions with the file system for reading input documents and writing output documents.
* **AI Provider Layer:** This layer abstracts interaction with different AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), providing a consistent interface.
* **Document Template Layer:** This layer stores templates for various document types, allowing for easy customization and extension.

**4. Module Descriptions:**

* **`cli.ts`:**  Handles command-line argument parsing and interaction.
* **`contextManager.ts`:** Manages project context, including intelligent source discovery, relevance scoring, and three-phase context strategy implementation.  Handles token limits and optimization strategies for different LLMs.
* **`llmProcessor.ts`:**  Abstracts interaction with LLMs, managing prompts, handling responses, and implementing retry logic.
* **`documentGenerators/`:** Contains individual modules for generating specific document types (e.g., `projectCharterGenerator.ts`, `stakeholderRegisterGenerator.ts`). Each module utilizes templates and AI interactions to create its respective document.
* **`pmbokValidator.ts`:** Validates generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing compliance scores and recommendations.
* **`vcsManager.ts`:** Manages the local Git repository for generated documents.
* **`providerAdapters/`:** Contains adapters for different AI providers, abstracting provider-specific APIs.


**5. Interface Specifications:**

* **CLI Interface:** Uses command-line arguments to specify actions (generate, validate, etc.), document types, and output directory.
* **AI Provider Interface:** Defines methods for sending prompts and receiving responses from LLMs.  This interface is implemented by adapter modules for each provider.
* **Document Template Interface:** Defines the structure and format of document templates.


**6. Data Structures:**

* **ProjectContext:**  A structured object representing the extracted project context, including relevant files, scores, and categorized content.
* **DocumentMetadata:**  Contains information about a generated document, including its type, version, and quality score.
* **AIProviderResponse:**  Represents the response from an LLM, including generated text and metadata.


**7. Processing Logic:**

1. **CLI Input:** The CLI parses user input and determines the required actions.
2. **Project Analysis:** The `contextManager` analyzes project files, scores sources, and builds a `ProjectContext`.
3. **Context Management:**  The `contextManager` applies its three-phase context strategy to optimize the context for the selected LLM.
4. **Document Generation:**  The appropriate `documentGenerator` module is called, using the `llmProcessor` to interact with the selected AI provider.
5. **PMBOK Validation:** The `pmbokValidator` validates the generated document.
6. **Version Control:** The `vcsManager` commits the generated document to the local Git repository.
7. **Output:** The generated document is written to the specified output directory.


**8. Error Handling:**

* **AI Provider Errors:**  The `llmProcessor` includes retry logic and fallback mechanisms to handle temporary provider outages.  Detailed error messages are logged.
* **File System Errors:**  Robust error handling for file I/O operations.
* **Validation Errors:**  Detailed reports on PMBOK compliance issues.
* **General Errors:**  Comprehensive logging and user-friendly error messages.


**9. Performance Requirements:**

* **Response Time:**  Document generation should complete within a reasonable timeframe, depending on document complexity and LLM provider.
* **Scalability:**  The system should be able to handle large projects with extensive documentation.
* **Resource Utilization:**  Efficient use of CPU and memory resources.


**10. System Constraints:**

* **AI Provider Limits:**  The system is subject to the limitations of the chosen AI provider, including token limits and API quotas.
* **File Size Limits:**  The system may have limitations on the size of input files and generated documents.


**11. Dependencies:**

* Node.js (v18 or higher)
* TypeScript
* @azure/openai (or other AI provider SDKs)
* Git


**12. Future Considerations:**

* **Improved Context Management:** Explore more sophisticated context summarization and pruning techniques.
* **GUI Development:**  Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for enhanced user experience.
* **Integration with PM Tools:**  Integrate with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Plugin Architecture:**  Implement a plugin architecture to easily extend functionality.
