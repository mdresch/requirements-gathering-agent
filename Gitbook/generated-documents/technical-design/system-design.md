## System Design Specification: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Senior Software Architect


**1. Introduction**

This document specifies the system design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a revolutionary AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation and executive-level business communications.  ADPA leverages advanced AI models (currently supporting Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama) with an innovative context management system to achieve unprecedented accuracy and contextual understanding.  The system is designed for modularity, extensibility, and ease of use via a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI).

**2. System Overview**

ADPA is a multi-faceted system encompassing several key subsystems:

* **Project Context Analyzer:**  This subsystem analyzes project documentation (README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.) to build a comprehensive understanding of the project. It scores documents based on relevance and automatically categorizes them (primary, planning, development, documentation, other).
* **Enhanced Context Manager:** This intelligent system manages and optimizes the context provided to the AI models. It employs a three-phase strategy (Core Context, Ultra-Large Model Support, Large Model Supplementary) to maximize context utilization for various AI models, handling different token limits efficiently.
* **AI Provider Interface:**  An abstraction layer providing uniform interaction with various AI providers. This allows for easy switching between providers and provides fallback mechanisms for failures.
* **Document Generation Engine:**  This subsystem uses AI models and pre-defined templates to generate various document types, including PMBOK documents, technical design documents, and strategic business communications. It incorporates PMBOK validation and quality assessment features.
* **Version Control System (VCS):**  A built-in VCS (Git) automatically tracks changes to generated documents, providing version history, diffs, and the ability to revert to previous versions.  Remote repository synchronization is optional.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A user-friendly CLI provides access to all system functionalities, including document generation, context management, validation, and VCS operations.
* **Modular Processor Architecture:** A plugin architecture allows for easy addition of new document types and AI models without modifying core code.  Processors are configured in `processor-config.json`.


**3. System Architecture**

The system architecture is a layered approach:

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
| Project Context  | --> | Context Manager | --> | AI Provider     | --> | Document Gen.  | --> | Output Files    |
|    Analyzer     |     |     (3-Phase)   |     |   Interface     |     |     Engine      |     |   (VCS managed) |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
      ^                                                                     |
      |                                                                     V
      +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
                                         | CLI Interface
                                         V
                                   User Interaction
```

**3.1 Detailed Component Descriptions:**

* **Project Context Analyzer:** Uses `glob` and custom logic to discover and analyze project documents.  Relevance scoring is based on content analysis, file location, naming patterns, and content structure.  Output is a structured representation of discovered files and their relevance scores.  Uses a configurable set of directories to search, allowing users to control the scope of analysis.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:**  This component implements the three-phase context strategy:
    * **Phase 1 (Core Context):** Prioritizes directly related content.
    * **Phase 2 (Ultra-Large Model Support):** Includes all available context for models with large token limits.
    * **Phase 3 (Large Model Supplementary):** Selectively adds supplementary context for models with smaller token limits.
    * The manager dynamically adapts to the capabilities of the selected AI model.
* **AI Provider Interface:**  Abstracts away the specifics of different AI providers.  This interface handles authentication, API calls, and error handling.  Supports Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.  Uses a factory pattern to instantiate the appropriate provider.
* **Document Generation Engine:**  Takes the processed project context and uses AI models and templates to generate documents.  Each document type has a dedicated processor.  Processors use specialized AI prompts to generate content.  Includes PMBOK validation and quality assessment.
* **Version Control System (VCS):**  Uses a local Git repository within the `generated-documents` directory.  Provides CLI commands for managing the repository.  Optional remote repository synchronization.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  Parses command-line arguments, interacts with other components, and manages user input.  Provides detailed help information and error messages.
* **Modular Processor Architecture:**  Uses a factory pattern to load and instantiate document processors based on configuration in `processor-config.json`.  Each processor is responsible for generating a specific document type.


**4. Data Model**

The core data structures include:

* **ProjectContext:**  A representation of the project context, including discovered files, their relevance scores, and categorized content.
* **AIProviderConfig:**  Configuration settings for each AI provider (API keys, endpoints, model names).
* **DocumentTemplate:**  Predefined templates for different document types (markdown, JSON, YAML).
* **GeneratedDocument:**  The generated document, including content, metadata, and version information.
* **ValidationResult:**  Results of PMBOK validation and quality assessment.


**5. Technology Stack**

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama
* **Testing Framework:** Jest
* **Package Manager:** npm
* **Libraries:**  `glob`, `node-fetch`,  Azure SDKs, Google Generative AI SDK, etc.


**6. Deployment**

ADPA can be deployed as a command-line tool, installable via npm (`npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent`).  The system is designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.

**7. Security Considerations**

* **API Key Management:** API keys are stored securely in environment variables (`.env` file).
* **Authentication:**  Utilizes secure authentication methods provided by each AI provider (Azure Entra ID, Google OAuth, GitHub OAuth).
* **Input Validation:**  Input data is validated to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Sanitization:**  Generated documents are sanitized to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.


**8. Future Enhancements**

* **Improved Context Management:**  More sophisticated algorithms for context selection and summarization.
* **Support for Additional Document Types:**  Expansion of the modular processor architecture to include more PMBOK documents and other project artifacts.
* **Integration with Project Management Tools:**  Integration with popular project management platforms (Jira, Asana, etc.).
* **Advanced Analytics:**  Provide more detailed analytics on context utilization, generation time, and document quality.


**9. Appendix**

This section would contain detailed diagrams (e.g., UML diagrams, sequence diagrams), database schemas (if applicable), and detailed specifications for each component.  It would also include a complete list of API endpoints and data structures.


This System Design Specification provides a high-level overview.  A more detailed design document would be necessary for implementation.
