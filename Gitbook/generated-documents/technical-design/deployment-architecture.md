## Deployment Architecture Document: ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant)

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023


**1. Deployment Overview**

ADPA is a Node.js application deployed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool.  The primary deployment target is npm, allowing users to install and run the application directly from their terminal.  Future iterations may include containerized deployments (Docker) and potentially a cloud-based SaaS offering. This document outlines the deployment architecture for the current npm-based deployment.


**2. Infrastructure Architecture**

The infrastructure for ADPA is primarily client-side, residing on the user's machine. The application interacts with various AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) via their respective APIs.  No dedicated server infrastructure is required for the core application functionality.

* **Client-Side:** User's machine running Node.js 18.0.0 or higher.
* **AI Provider APIs:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama (externally managed services).
* **NPM Registry:**  The npm registry hosts the ADPA package for distribution and installation.


**3. Environment Setup**

ADPA requires Node.js 18.0.0 or higher to be installed on the user's machine.  The application uses environment variables to configure API keys and other settings.  Users must create a `.env` file in the application's root directory with the necessary credentials for their chosen AI provider.

* **Node.js:** Version 18.0.0 or higher.
* **.env file:** Contains API keys and other environment-specific configurations.  Example:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/
DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4-32k
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
```

**4. Deployment Process**

The deployment process is straightforward due to the npm-based distribution:

1. **Development:** Code is developed and tested locally.
2. **Versioning:** Code is versioned using Git.
3. **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests are run before releasing a new version.
4. **Packaging:** The application is packaged into an npm package.
5. **Publishing:** The npm package is published to the npm registry using `npm publish`.  This automatically updates the package available for installation.
6. **Installation:** Users install the package using `npm install -g requirements-gathering-agent` or `npx requirements-gathering-agent`.


**5. Configuration Management**

Configuration is managed primarily through environment variables stored in the `.env` file.  This allows users to customize settings without modifying the core application code.  The application robustly handles missing or invalid configurations, providing helpful error messages to the user.


**6. Scaling Strategy**

The current npm-based deployment scales horizontally.  As more users install and utilize ADPA, the load is distributed across their individual machines.  No central server infrastructure needs to handle the scaling burden.  Future cloud-based deployments may utilize serverless functions or container orchestration platforms for scalability.


**7. Monitoring Setup**

Monitoring is currently limited to user-reported issues and error logging within the application itself.  Future versions might integrate with application performance monitoring (APM) tools to track usage patterns, error rates, and performance metrics.


**8. Backup and Recovery**

Backups are handled by users themselves through their version control system (Git).  The generated documents are stored locally on the user's machine.  There is no central repository for backup and recovery of generated documents.


**9. Disaster Recovery**

Disaster recovery relies on the user's ability to reinstall the application from npm and restore their project data from backups.  The application itself is stateless, meaning there's no data loss on the application side.


**10. Maintenance Procedures**

Maintenance involves bug fixes, feature enhancements, and security updates.  These updates are deployed by publishing new versions to npm.  Users can update their local installation by running `npm update -g requirements-gathering-agent`.


**11. Security Considerations**

* **API Key Management:**  Users are responsible for securely storing their API keys.  The application does not store or manage API keys persistently.
* **Input Validation:**  The application performs input validation to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Sanitization:** Generated documents are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:**  Dependencies are carefully vetted and updated regularly to mitigate security risks.


**12. Future Enhancements**

* **Docker Containerization:**  Creating a Docker image for easier deployment and portability.
* **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implementing a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
* **Cloud-Based Deployment:**  Exploring cloud-based deployment options for improved scalability and reliability.
* **Centralized Document Storage:**  Offering optional cloud storage for generated documents.


This document provides a high-level overview of the ADPA deployment architecture.  Specific details may change as the application evolves.
