## Performance Requirements for ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant)

These performance requirements are categorized to address various aspects of ADPA's functionality and ensure a high-quality user experience.  The requirements are designed to be measurable and testable, allowing for objective assessment during development and deployment.

**I.  Document Generation Performance:**

* **Goal:**  Generate comprehensive, accurate, and PMBOK-compliant project documentation within acceptable timeframes.

* **Metrics:**
    * **Average Generation Time:** The average time taken to generate the complete suite of PMBOK documents (including all optional documents) for a project of average complexity (defined as a project with a README.md file and 5-10 supporting markdown files totaling approximately 10,000 words). Target:  Under 5 minutes.
    * **Generation Time Variability:** The standard deviation of generation time across multiple runs with the same input. Target: Standard deviation under 1 minute.
    * **Individual Document Generation Time:**  The maximum generation time for any single document type within the suite. Target:  Under 2 minutes for any single document.
    * **Error Rate:** The percentage of document generation attempts that result in errors (including API errors, processing errors, and invalid output). Target: Less than 1%.
    * **Token Utilization Efficiency:** The percentage of available tokens used by the LLM during document generation.  Target:  Above 80% for large context models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro), above 50% for smaller models (e.g., GPT-4).


**II.  Project Analysis Performance:**

* **Goal:**  Efficiently and accurately analyze project documentation to build comprehensive context for the LLM.

* **Metrics:**
    * **Analysis Time:** The time taken to analyze all relevant project files (including recursive directory traversal and relevance scoring). Target: Under 30 seconds for projects of average complexity.
    * **File Discovery Rate:** The percentage of relevant project files successfully identified and analyzed. Target:  99%.
    * **Relevance Scoring Accuracy:**  The correlation between the automated relevance scores and manual assessment of file relevance (measured using a correlation coefficient). Target: Correlation coefficient above 0.8.
    * **Memory Usage:** Peak memory consumption during project analysis. Target: Under 2GB of RAM for projects of average complexity.


**III.  API Interaction Performance:**

* **Goal:**  Reliable and efficient communication with various AI providers.

* **Metrics:**
    * **Average API Latency:** The average response time from each AI provider. Target: Under 10 seconds for all providers.
    * **API Error Rate:** The percentage of API calls that result in errors (including rate limits, authentication failures, and service outages). Target: Less than 1%.
    * **Retry Mechanism Effectiveness:** The success rate of retry attempts for failed API calls. Target:  Above 95%.


**IV.  System Scalability:**

* **Goal:**  Handle projects of varying size and complexity without performance degradation.

* **Metrics:**
    * **Throughput:** The number of projects processed per hour under peak load conditions (simulated load testing required). Target:  To be determined based on projected user load.
    * **Response Time under Load:**  Average response time under simulated peak load. Target:  Response time increase under 20% compared to baseline.


**V.  Resource Utilization:**

* **Goal:**  Optimize resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O) for efficient performance.

* **Metrics:**
    * **CPU Utilization:** Average CPU usage during document generation and analysis. Target:  Under 75%.
    * **Memory Usage:** Average memory usage during document generation and analysis. Target:  Under 4GB of RAM.
    * **Disk I/O:** Average disk I/O operations during document generation and analysis. Target:  To be determined based on testing.


**VI.  Monitoring and Logging:**

* **Goal:**  Provide comprehensive monitoring and logging for performance analysis and troubleshooting.

* **Requirements:**
    * Real-time monitoring of key performance indicators (KPIs).
    * Detailed logging of API calls, processing times, errors, and warnings.
    * Centralized logging and monitoring dashboard.


**VII. Performance Testing Plan:**

* **Approach:** A combination of load testing, stress testing, and unit testing will be employed to validate performance requirements.  Load testing will simulate peak user loads, stress testing will push the system beyond its limits to identify breaking points, and unit tests will ensure individual components function correctly.
* **Tools:**  JMeter (or similar load testing tool), automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Cypress).
* **Test Scenarios:**  A range of scenarios will be tested, including:
    * Generating documents for small, medium, and large projects.
    * Simulating concurrent user requests.
    * Testing error handling and retry mechanisms.
    * Testing different AI providers.

**VIII.  Acceptance Criteria:**

The system will be considered to meet performance requirements if all the metrics defined above are achieved during the performance testing phase.  Any deviations from the targets will need to be investigated and addressed before deployment.


This detailed specification provides a robust framework for evaluating and optimizing ADPA's performance throughout its lifecycle.  The specific targets for metrics like throughput and response time under load will be refined based on further analysis of projected user demand and system capabilities.
