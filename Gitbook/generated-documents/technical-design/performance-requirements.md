## Performance Requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

These performance requirements are categorized for clarity and address various aspects of ADPA's functionality.  They are based on the provided documentation, emphasizing the need for speed, scalability, and reliability in handling large volumes of data and diverse document types.

**I. Context Discovery and Processing:**

* **Requirement 1.1 (Context Discovery Speed):**  The system shall discover and analyze at least 100 markdown files within 10 seconds, with a target of under 5 seconds for typical project sizes (as demonstrated in the existing 83+ file analysis in <5 seconds).  This includes recursive file discovery and relevance scoring.  The time should scale proportionally to the number of files.

* **Requirement 1.2 (Relevance Scoring Accuracy):** The relevance scoring algorithm (0-100) shall demonstrate an accuracy of at least 90% in identifying high-relevance documents based on PMBOK terminology, file location, naming patterns, and content structure.  This accuracy should be validated through A/B testing and manual review of a representative sample.

* **Requirement 1.3 (Context Integration):** The system shall integrate content from at least 20 different markdown files simultaneously into the context for generating any single document, with a target of integrating up to 50 files when available without exceeding token limits.  The selection process should prioritize high-scoring relevant documents.


**II. Document Generation:**

* **Requirement 2.1 (Generation Speed):** The generation time for a single PMBOK document (e.g., Project Charter) shall not exceed 60 seconds under normal load conditions, with a target of under 30 seconds.  The generation time for all technical documents should not exceed 120 seconds under normal load.  This should be benchmarked against various document complexities and input sizes.

* **Requirement 2.2 (Document Quality):** Generated documents shall adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards, achieving a minimum compliance score of 90% as determined by an automated validation process.  This includes structural correctness, terminology accuracy, and completeness of required sections.

* **Requirement 2.3 (Output Consistency):** All generated documents shall maintain internal consistency and cross-referencing accuracy, with no conflicting information or broken links. This will be verified through automated cross-referencing checks and manual review.


**III. API and External Service Interactions:**

* **Requirement 3.1 (API Response Time):**  API calls to Azure OpenAI (and other supported providers) shall have an average response time under 5 seconds, with a maximum response time under 15 seconds.  Error handling and retry mechanisms should be implemented to mitigate potential API failures.

* **Requirement 3.2 (Error Handling):** The system shall gracefully handle API errors, network issues, and other unforeseen exceptions, providing informative error messages to the user and attempting automatic retries where appropriate.  A comprehensive logging system should record all errors and their resolutions.

* **Requirement 3.3 (Authentication Security):**  All API interactions shall utilize secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., Azure Entra ID, OAuth 2.0) to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access.


**IV. Scalability and Resource Utilization:**

* **Requirement 4.1 (Scalability):** The system shall be able to handle at least 5 concurrent document generation requests without significant performance degradation, with a target of handling 20 concurrent requests. This will be tested under load testing conditions simulating peak usage.

* **Requirement 4.2 (Resource Utilization):**  The system's CPU and memory utilization shall remain below 80% under normal load conditions, preventing resource starvation and ensuring responsiveness. This will be monitored during performance testing.

* **Requirement 4.3 (Large Context Handling):** The Enhanced Context Manager shall effectively utilize up to 90% of the available context window for large language models like Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M tokens), resulting in improved document accuracy.


**V. Version Control System (VCS):**

* **Requirement 5.1 (Commit Speed):**  The automated VCS commit process shall complete within 5 seconds after document generation.

* **Requirement 5.2 (Repository Size):** The generated document repository shall be designed to efficiently handle large numbers of documents and revisions without performance degradation.


**VI.  Monitoring and Logging:**

* **Requirement 6.1 (Monitoring):** The system shall provide comprehensive monitoring of key performance metrics (response times, error rates, resource utilization) through a dashboard or logging system.

* **Requirement 6.2 (Logging):**  Detailed logs shall be maintained for all system activities, including context analysis, document generation, API calls, and error handling.  These logs should be easily searchable and analyzable for debugging and performance analysis.


These performance requirements are a starting point and may need further refinement based on specific project needs and testing results.  Regular performance testing and monitoring are crucial to ensure ADPA continues to meet these requirements as it evolves.
