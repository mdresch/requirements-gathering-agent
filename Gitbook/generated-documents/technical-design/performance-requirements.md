## Performance Requirements for ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

These performance requirements are designed to ensure the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent meets the needs of a Fortune 500 enterprise environment, balancing speed, scalability, and resource efficiency.  The requirements are categorized for clarity.

**I. Response Time Requirements:**

* **API Endpoint Response Times:**
    * `/api/v1/health`: < 100ms (99th percentile)
    * `/api/v1/documents/convert`: < 2000ms (99th percentile) for documents up to 5000 words of input.  This should scale linearly with input size, with a maximum acceptable response time of 10 seconds for exceptionally large inputs (e.g., 50,000 words).  Testing should include realistic enterprise-sized data sets.
    * `/api/v1/documents/jobs`: < 500ms (99th percentile)
    * `/api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`: < 200ms (99th percentile)
    * `/api/v1/documents/download/{id}`:  Dependent on file size; target download speeds should be optimized for network conditions.  Performance testing should simulate various network bandwidths.
    * `/api/v1/templates` (GET & POST): < 500ms (99th percentile)


* **CLI Command Execution Times:**  All CLI commands (e.g., `babok:generate`, `pmbok:generate`) should complete within a reasonable timeframe, with the primary focus on the document generation commands mirroring the API response time requirements.


**II. Throughput Expectations:**

* **Requests per Second (RPS):** The API should handle at least 100 RPS concurrently under peak load, with graceful degradation beyond this threshold.  This needs to be tested with a realistic mix of API calls (short, long, read, write).
* **Documents Generated per Hour:** The system should be capable of generating at least 500 enterprise-grade documents per hour under peak load.  This should be tested with varying document complexity and input data size.

**III. Scalability Requirements:**

* **Horizontal Scalability:** The architecture should support horizontal scaling to accommodate increasing load and user demand.  The system should be designed for easy deployment and management across multiple servers or cloud instances.
* **Load Balancing:**  Implementation of a load balancer is mandatory to distribute traffic effectively across multiple instances.
* **Database Scalability:** The database chosen (if any) should be scalable to handle the expected data volume and query load.


**IV. Resource Utilization:**

* **CPU Utilization:**  CPU usage should remain below 80% under peak load conditions.
* **Memory Utilization:** Memory usage should remain below 80% under peak load conditions.
* **Disk I/O:** Disk I/O should be optimized to minimize latency and ensure efficient data access.


**V. Load Handling:**

* **Stress Testing:**  Comprehensive stress testing should be conducted to identify bottlenecks and ensure the system remains stable and responsive under high load conditions.  This should include load tests with varying request patterns and data sizes.
* **Error Handling:**  The system must gracefully handle errors and provide informative error messages to the user.  Error rates should be monitored and kept below an acceptable threshold (e.g., < 1%).


**VI. Caching Strategy:**

* **API Response Caching:**  Appropriate caching mechanisms should be implemented to reduce database load and improve response times for frequently accessed data.  This should be carefully considered to avoid stale data issues.
* **Template Caching:**  Templates should be cached in memory to reduce the overhead of repeated template loading.


**VII. Performance Metrics:**

* **Response Times (p50, p95, p99):**  These should be continuously monitored for all critical API endpoints.
* **RPS:**  Monitored using appropriate tools.
* **Error Rates:**  Tracked for all API endpoints.
* **CPU & Memory Utilization:**  Monitored for all servers.
* **Disk I/O:**  Monitored for performance bottlenecks.
* **Database Query Times:**  Monitored if a database is used.


**VIII. Monitoring Requirements:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement a real-time monitoring system to track key performance metrics and identify potential issues proactively.
* **Alerting:**  Set up alerts to notify the operations team of critical performance issues.
* **Logging:**  Comprehensive logging should be implemented to aid in debugging and performance analysis.  Logs should be structured and easily searchable.


**IX. Performance Testing Plan:**

* **Load Testing:**  Simulate high user loads to identify bottlenecks.
* **Stress Testing:**  Push the system beyond its limits to assess its stability.
* **Endurance Testing:**  Run tests over extended periods to evaluate long-term performance.
* **Spike Testing:**  Simulate sudden surges in traffic to assess the system's responsiveness.


**X. Baseline Requirements:**

Before any performance optimization efforts, establish a baseline performance profile through initial testing.  This baseline will serve as a benchmark to measure the effectiveness of future improvements.


These performance requirements are not exhaustive and may need to be adjusted based on ongoing testing and feedback.  The focus should always be on delivering a high-performance, reliable, and scalable system capable of meeting the demands of a large enterprise.
