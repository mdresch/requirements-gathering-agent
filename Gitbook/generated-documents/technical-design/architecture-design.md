# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Status:** Draft


## 1. Executive Summary

The ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) is a Node.js/TypeScript command-line application that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate comprehensive project documentation conforming to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  ADPA distinguishes itself through its advanced context management, multi-provider AI support, and built-in validation capabilities. This document details ADPA's architecture, encompassing its core components, data flow, technology stack, and security considerations.  The system's modular design allows for future expansion and adaptation to evolving project management methodologies and AI technologies.


## 2. System Overview

ADPA automates the creation of project documentation, transforming unstructured project information (primarily from README files and associated markdown documents) into a structured suite of PMBOK-compliant documents.  Its unique "Context Foundation" approach uses AI to not only generate documentation but also perform strategic project inception, creating business cases, stakeholder registers, and project charters.  The system also functions as a "Business Communication Translator," generating executive-ready strategic documents such as purpose statements and company values.

### 2.1 Goals

* Automate the generation of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation.
* Improve the accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* Reduce the time and effort required for documentation creation.
* Provide a flexible and extensible platform for future enhancements.
* Support multiple AI providers for redundancy and optimal performance.
* Integrate seamlessly into existing project workflows.

### 2.2 Scope

ADPA's scope includes the automated generation of a comprehensive suite of PMBOK documents (as detailed in the project README),  strategic business communications, and robust validation against PMBOK standards.  It does *not* include direct integration with external project management tools (though a modular architecture allows for future integration).


## 3. Architectural Principles

* **Modularity:** The system is designed with a modular architecture, using a plugin system (ProcessorFactory) to manage document generation.  This promotes maintainability, extensibility, and easier integration of new document types or AI providers.
* **Extensibility:**  New document types can be added easily through the plugin system, requiring only the implementation of a new processor and its registration.
* **Multi-Provider Support:**  The system supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama) through an abstraction layer, providing resilience and the ability to leverage the strengths of different models.
* **Context-Aware Generation:** An "Enhanced Context Manager" uses a three-phase strategy to maximize the utilization of the LLM's context window, significantly improving the quality and accuracy of generated documents.
* **Validation and Quality Assurance:**  Built-in validation ensures PMBOK 7.0 compliance and provides quality scores with actionable recommendations.
* **Version Control:**  A built-in version control system tracks changes to generated documents.


## 4. System Architecture

ADPA employs a layered architecture, with the following key components:

### 4.1 Context Analyzer

This component is responsible for:

* **Source Discovery:** Recursively searches the project directory for relevant markdown files.
* **Relevance Scoring:**  Assigns a relevance score (0-100) to each file based on content, location, and naming patterns.
* **Categorization:**  Categorizes discovered files (Primary, Planning, Development, Documentation, Other).
* **Context Building:** Prioritizes and integrates relevant information from multiple files into a comprehensive project context.

### 4.2 Enhanced Context Manager

This intelligent component manages the project context provided to the LLM:

* **Three-Phase Strategy:** Adapts its approach based on the chosen LLM's context window size (Core Context, Ultra-Large Model Support, Large Model Supplementary).
* **Model Detection:** Automatically detects the capabilities of the selected AI provider and model.
* **Token Optimization:**  Balances context size to avoid token limits while maximizing information.
* **Reporting:** Provides detailed reports on context utilization and performance.

### 4.3 LLM Processor

This component interacts with the selected AI provider:

* **Provider Abstraction:**  Uses an abstraction layer to interact with various AI providers uniformly.
* **Document Generation:**  Generates documents based on the provided context and selected document template.
* **Error Handling:**  Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms.

### 4.4 Document Validator

This component validates generated documents:

* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance:** Checks for completeness and adherence to PMBOK standards.
* **Quality Assessment:**  Provides a quality score and actionable recommendations.
* **Consistency Check:**  Ensures consistency in terminology and information across different documents.

### 4.5 Version Control System

This component manages the version history of generated documents using Git:

* **Automatic Committing:**  Automatically commits changes after each document generation.
* **CLI Integration:**  Provides CLI commands for managing the local Git repository.
* **Remote Synchronization:** Allows for optional synchronization with a remote repository.

### 4.6 Command-Line Interface (CLI)

This component provides user interaction:

* **Command Parsing:**  Parses command-line arguments and options.
* **Configuration Management:**  Loads configuration from environment variables or a config file.
* **Orchestration:**  Orchestrates the execution of the other components.


## 5. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** TypeScript
* **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
* **Testing Framework:** Jest
* **AI Providers:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama (through abstraction layer)
* **Package Manager:** npm
* **Version Control:** Git


## 6. Data Flow

1. The **CLI** receives user input and configuration parameters.
2. The **Context Analyzer** discovers and analyzes project documentation, generating a scored and categorized context.
3. The **Enhanced Context Manager** processes the context, optimizing it for the chosen LLM.
4. The **LLM Processor** sends the context to the selected AI provider and receives the generated document.
5. The **Document Validator** assesses the generated document for PMBOK compliance and quality.
6. The **Version Control System** tracks changes to generated documents.
7. The **CLI** presents the results to the user.


## 7. Security Considerations

* **API Key Management:** API keys for AI providers are stored securely in environment variables or a secure configuration file, avoiding hardcoding.
* **Authentication:**  For Azure OpenAI, Entra ID authentication is used for enhanced security.
* **Data Handling:** Generated documents are written to a designated output directory.  No sensitive project data is stored persistently beyond the duration of execution.
* **Input Validation:**  Input parameters are validated to prevent injection attacks.


## 8. Deployment Architecture

ADPA is designed for deployment as a command-line tool.  It can be installed globally using npm or run directly with npx.  The modular architecture facilitates easy integration into CI/CD pipelines.


## 9. Future Enhancements

* **Integration with Project Management Tools:**  Integration with popular project management tools (Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.).
* **Improved Context Management:**  Further optimization of context handling for even larger projects.
* **Advanced Document Templates:**  Inclusion of more specialized templates for specific PMBOK areas.
* **Enhanced Validation:**  Support for additional compliance standards and best practices.
* **Support for Additional File Types:**  Expanding the range of supported file types (e.g., diagrams, images).


This architecture design provides a solid foundation for the ADPA project. Its modularity, extensibility, and focus on quality assurance make it well-suited for evolving project management needs and future technological advancements.
