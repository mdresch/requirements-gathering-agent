# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-generated, requires human review and validation)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the system architecture for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent. ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered system designed to generate comprehensive project documentation based on provided context.  Its key differentiators are its Evaluative Contextual Synthesis, Hierarchical Authority Recognition, and a modular architecture supporting multiple AI providers and document types.


## 2. System Overview

ADPA's primary function is to transform raw project information (primarily Markdown files, but potentially expandable to other formats) into a complete suite of project management documents adhering to PMBOK 7.0 standards, as well as generating technical design documents and strategic business communications. This is accomplished through a multi-stage process:

1. **Context Discovery and Analysis:** ADPA intelligently scans specified directories, identifying and scoring relevant project documents based on content, location, and naming conventions.  This goes beyond simple README analysis, incorporating a wide range of project artifacts.

2. **Context Synthesis and Prioritization:**  The system uses its "Enhanced Context Manager" to prioritize and synthesize discovered information, weighing evidence and resolving conflicts based on source authority. This process leverages a three-phase strategy optimized for different LLM capabilities (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini).

3. **Document Generation:**  Based on the synthesized context, ADPA uses specialized AI prompts and professional templates to generate the requested documentation.  A modular architecture allows for easy extension with new document types and AI providers.

4. **Validation and Quality Assurance:**  Generated documents are validated against PMBOK standards and undergo a quality assessment, providing detailed scores and recommendations for improvement.

5. **Version Control (Optional):**  ADPA includes an integrated version control system for generated documents, providing an audit trail and enabling rollback to previous versions.

6. **Output Management:**  Generated documents are organized into a clearly structured directory, enabling easy access and review.


## 3. Architectural Principles

ADPA's architecture is guided by the following principles:

* **Modularity:** The system is designed using a modular architecture, allowing for easy extension and maintenance. Individual document generation and AI provider integration are handled by independent modules.
* **Extensibility:** New document types and AI providers can be added with minimal code changes, thanks to the plugin-based processor architecture and configuration files (`processor-config.json`).
* **Flexibility:** ADPA supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), allowing users to choose the best option for their needs and budget.
* **Reliability:**  Robust error handling and retry mechanisms ensure system stability and minimize downtime.
* **Scalability:** The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more processing nodes to handle larger projects or increased demand.
* **Maintainability:**  Clean code, comprehensive testing (using Jest), and clear documentation facilitate ongoing maintenance and updates.


## 4. System Architecture

ADPA follows a layered architecture:

**Layer 1: CLI Interface & Configuration:**  This layer provides a command-line interface for user interaction and manages system configurations (from `.env` files and command-line arguments).

**Layer 2: Core Logic:** This layer contains the core functionality:

* **Project Analyzer:** Discovers and analyzes project documents.
* **Context Manager:**  Synthesizes and prioritizes the project context.
* **Processor Factory:** Manages the instantiation and execution of document generation processors.
* **Document Validators:**  Validate generated documents against PMBOK standards.

**Layer 3: Document Processors:** This layer contains individual modules (processors) responsible for generating specific document types (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, etc., including the newly added technical design documents). Each processor uses specialized AI prompts and templates.

**Layer 4: AI Provider Integrations:** This layer handles communication with different AI providers, abstracting away provider-specific details.  It includes fallback mechanisms to handle provider failures.

**Layer 5: Output Management:** This layer handles the organization and storage of generated documents.  It also incorporates the optional version control system.


## 5. Component Diagrams

**(Due to the complexity, detailed component diagrams would be extensive.  A simplified representation is provided below.  More detailed diagrams would be included in a full-scale architectural document.)**
