# Architecture Design Document

**Project Name:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-23
**Status:** Final

## 1. Executive Summary

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary platform automating the generation of enterprise-grade business analysis frameworks, significantly reducing time and effort while ensuring compliance with industry standards like BABOK v3.  This document details the system architecture, encompassing a robust API-first design, sophisticated AI integration, and a scalable infrastructure capable of handling complex, Fortune 500-level projects.  The system's core strength lies in its ability to generate comprehensive, accurate deliverables in seconds, eliminating human error and drastically improving efficiency.  Key differentiators include its API-first approach using TypeSpec for design, multi-AI provider support, and extensive enterprise-level security and error handling.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Purpose and Scope

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent aims to automate the creation of standardized business analysis frameworks, such as BABOK v3 compliant documents, from user-provided input data. The system's scope includes requirements elicitation, stakeholder analysis, regulatory compliance integration (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX), and multi-format output generation (PDF, DOCX, HTML).  The system is designed for enterprise-level use and incorporates robust security and error handling mechanisms.  Future expansion may include support for additional frameworks like PMBOK and DMBOK.

### 2.2 Stakeholders

* **Primary Users:** Business Analysts, Project Managers, Enterprise Architects
* **System Administrators:** IT Operations, DevOps Engineers
* **Developers:** Software Engineers, Data Scientists
* **Business Stakeholders:** Project Sponsors, Executives

## 3. Architectural Principles

The architecture adheres to the following principles:

* **API-First:**  Prioritizes the design and implementation of a well-defined, robust API, driving the development of all other components.  TypeSpec is used for API specification and validation.
* **Microservices-Ready:** Designed to facilitate future decomposition into independent, deployable microservices.
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Employs horizontal scaling strategies and efficient algorithms to ensure fast response times even under heavy load.
* **Security:**  Implements multi-layered security, including API key authentication, rate limiting, input validation, and secure data handling.
* **Maintainability:**  Utilizes a modular, well-documented codebase with comprehensive testing to ensure ease of maintenance and future development.
* **Extensibility:**  Supports plugin architecture to allow for easy integration with new AI providers and document formats.
* **Compliance:**  Strict adherence to BABOK v3 and other relevant regulatory standards.


## 4. System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture:

```
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
| Presentation     | <--> | API Gateway     | <--> | Business Logic  | <--> | Data Access     |
| Layer (Optional) |     |                 |     | Layer           |     | Layer           |
+-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+     +-----------------+
                                                                        |
                                                                        v
                                                                    +-----------------+
                                                                    | Data Storage    |
                                                                    | (Database, Cache)|
                                                                    +-----------------+

```

**Presentation Layer (Optional):**  A potential future addition for a user interface, currently not implemented.

**API Gateway:** Handles routing, authentication (API key and JWT), rate limiting, and request validation.  Uses Express.js.

**Business Logic Layer:**  Contains the core functionality for document generation, stakeholder analysis, and compliance integration.  Leverages AI providers via a dedicated abstraction layer.  Implemented using TypeScript and ES modules.

**Data Access Layer:**  Abstracts database interactions, providing a clean interface to the business logic layer.

**Data Storage Layer:**  Utilizes a database (currently unspecified, but could be PostgreSQL or similar) for persistent storage and a caching mechanism (Redis or similar) for performance optimization.

## 5. Component Design

### 5.1 Core Components

* **API Gateway:**  Express.js server responsible for routing, authentication, rate limiting, and input validation.  Utilizes middleware for security and logging.
* **Document Generation Service:**  Core service responsible for generating documents based on templates and input data.  Utilizes AI providers through an abstraction layer.
* **AI Provider Abstraction Layer:**  Provides a unified interface to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.), allowing for easy switching and fallback mechanisms.
* **Template Management Service:** Manages document templates, allowing for creation, modification, and retrieval.
* **Job Management Service:**  Handles asynchronous document generation jobs, providing status updates and progress tracking.
* **Input Validation Service:** Uses Zod schemas to enforce type safety and data integrity.
* **Logging Service:**  Implements structured logging using Winston, capturing detailed request tracing.


### 5.2 Component Interaction

Components communicate primarily via synchronous RESTful APIs.  The Job Management Service utilizes asynchronous messaging for job processing and status updates.

## 6. Data Architecture

### 6.1 Data Model

The system uses a flexible schema to accommodate various input data structures.  The core data elements include:

* **User Input Data:** Contains the project details, stakeholder information, and requirements.  Schema is validated using Zod.
* **Templates:**  Stores document templates in JSON format, defining the structure and content of generated documents.
* **Jobs:** Tracks asynchronous document generation jobs, including status, progress, and results.


### 6.2 Data Storage Strategy

A relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) will store persistent data.  A caching layer (e.g., Redis) will improve performance by storing frequently accessed data.

## 7. Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js framework, TypeScript
* **API Specification:** TypeSpec
* **AI Providers:** OpenAI, Google AI (with potential for others)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (or similar)
* **Cache:** Redis (or similar)
* **Input Validation:** Zod
* **Logging:** Winston
* **Authentication:** API keys, JWT (JSON Web Tokens) -  potentially expanded for future integrations.
* **Rate Limiting:** Express-rate-limit


## 8. Security Architecture

The system implements a multi-layered security approach:

* **Authentication:** API key authentication with role-based permissions.
* **Authorization:**  Fine-grained control over API access.
* **Input Validation:**  Zod schemas to prevent injection attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Protects against denial-of-service attacks.
* **Data Protection:**  Secure handling of sensitive data.
* **HTTPS:**  All communication is encrypted using HTTPS.


## 9. Deployment Architecture

The system will be deployed using a containerized approach (Docker and Kubernetes) on a cloud platform (Azure preferred). CI/CD pipelines will automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

## 10.  Future Considerations

* **Enhanced UI:** Development of a user-friendly web interface.
* **Additional Framework Support:** Integration with PMBOK and DMBOK.
* **Advanced Analytics:**  Integration of reporting and analytics capabilities.
* **Improved AI Model Selection:**  More sophisticated AI model selection and management.


## 11. Appendix A: Glossary
