## ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API: Error Handling Guidelines

These guidelines detail the error handling strategy for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, ensuring system reliability, graceful degradation, and informative user feedback.  The guidelines adhere to best practices for a production-ready, enterprise-grade API.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

The system employs a layered approach to error handling, incorporating:

* **Input Validation:**  Zod schemas rigorously validate all incoming requests before processing.  Invalid inputs result in immediate, client-side-friendly error responses (HTTP 400 Bad Request) with detailed descriptions of the validation failures.

* **Business Logic Error Handling:**  Within the application logic (`controllers`, `services`), errors are caught using `try...catch` blocks.  Specific error types are handled appropriately, potentially including retries, fallback mechanisms, or logging of exceptional circumstances.

* **Middleware Error Handling:** Middleware functions (`middleware`) intercept errors propagating from controllers and services. This layer standardizes error responses, adds logging, and potentially implements rate limiting or security measures.

* **Global Error Handling:**  A final layer catches unhandled exceptions and provides a generic error response (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error) while logging the full stack trace for debugging purposes.  This prevents the application from crashing and ensures a consistent user experience.


**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized for easier management and analysis:

* **Client Errors (4xx):**  These indicate issues with the client's request, such as invalid input, missing parameters, authentication failures (401 Unauthorized), or resource not found (404 Not Found).  Responses provide specific details about the error to facilitate correction.

* **Server Errors (5xx):** These indicate problems on the server-side, such as internal processing errors, database failures, or unexpected exceptions.  Responses are generic to prevent exposing sensitive information, but detailed logging aids in debugging and resolution.

* **Business Errors:** These are application-specific errors related to the core functionality, such as insufficient resources, invalid data within the input (beyond simple type validation), or conflicts with existing data.  These errors are handled within the business logic and returned as client errors with appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive messages.

* **System Errors:** These represent failures within the underlying infrastructure (e.g., database connection issues, external API failures).  These are handled with server errors and extensive logging to identify the root cause.


**3. Error Logging:**

* **Structured Logging:**  Winston (or a similar structured logging library) is used to record all errors with timestamps, severity levels (error, warning, info), relevant context (request ID, user ID, API endpoint), and stack traces (for server errors).

* **Centralized Logging:** Log entries are aggregated in a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk) for monitoring, analysis, and alerting.

* **Log Levels:**  Appropriate log levels are used to avoid overwhelming the log with excessive information.  Error logs contain detailed information, while warnings and informational logs provide context for understanding the system's behavior.


**4. Error Reporting:**

* **Monitoring Tools:**  Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana) to track error rates, identify trends, and receive alerts for critical errors.  This allows proactive identification and resolution of issues.

* **Alerting:** Configure alerts based on error thresholds (e.g., error rate exceeding a certain percentage, specific error types occurring frequently).  Alerts should be sent to the appropriate teams via email, Slack, or other communication channels.


**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Automatic Retries:**  Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary database outages) with exponential backoff strategies.

* **Circuit Breakers:** Utilize circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures by temporarily stopping requests to failing external services or database connections.

* **Fallback Mechanisms:** Provide fallback mechanisms to gracefully handle failures of external dependencies.  This might involve using cached data, returning default values, or providing a degraded service.


**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

Retries should be configured with:

* **Maximum Retry Attempts:**  A limit to prevent infinite retry loops.
* **Exponential Backoff:**  Increasing delays between retry attempts to avoid overwhelming the failing service.
* **Jitter:**  Adding random delays to retry attempts to avoid synchronized retries.


**7. Circuit Breakers:**

Circuit breakers should be implemented using a library or custom logic to:

* **Monitor Failure Rate:** Track the success and failure rate of requests to a service.
* **Open Circuit:**  Stop sending requests when the failure rate exceeds a threshold.
* **Half-Open Circuit:**  Allow a limited number of requests after a timeout to check if the service has recovered.
* **Close Circuit:**  Resume normal operation when the service is functioning correctly.


**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Client-Friendly Messages:**  Error messages returned to the client should be clear, concise, and user-friendly. Avoid technical jargon and provide actionable advice.
* **HTTP Status Codes:**  Use appropriate HTTP status codes to indicate the nature of the error.
* **Error Codes:** Consider using error codes to provide more specific information about the error, allowing clients to handle errors differently based on their type.


**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Error Rate Monitoring:**  Track the rate of errors over time to identify trends and potential problems.
* **Alerting on Critical Errors:**  Set up alerts for critical errors that require immediate attention.
* **Error Logging Analysis:** Regularly analyze error logs to identify root causes and areas for improvement.


**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide should be maintained, documenting common errors, their causes, and steps to resolve them.  This guide should be accessible to both developers and support staff.


**Example Error Response (JSON):**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid input: 'projectName' must be a non-empty string.",
    "details": {
      "projectName": ["must be a string", "cannot be empty"]
    }
  }
}
```

These guidelines ensure the ADPA API is robust, reliable, and provides a positive user experience even in the face of errors.  Regular review and updates to these guidelines are crucial to maintain the quality and stability of the system.
