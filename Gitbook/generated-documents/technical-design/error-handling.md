## ADPA Error Handling Guidelines

These guidelines outline the error handling strategy for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, aiming for robust error detection, informative logging, graceful degradation, and efficient recovery.  The guidelines prioritize maintaining system reliability and providing a positive user experience.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

ADPA employs a layered approach to error handling, incorporating techniques appropriate to the context:

* **Prevention:**  Proactive measures to minimize errors through input validation, robust API interactions, and thorough testing.  This includes comprehensive input sanitization and validation at all entry points (CLI, configuration files, API requests).

* **Detection:**  Employing comprehensive exception handling mechanisms throughout the codebase, catching specific exceptions and handling them appropriately based on their type and context.

* **Logging:**  Detailed logging of errors, including timestamps, error types, stack traces, relevant context (e.g., input data, API responses), and affected components.  Log levels should be used effectively (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL).

* **Reporting:**  Aggregating and summarizing error logs for reporting and analysis.  This may involve dashboards, alerts, and automated reports to identify trends and potential system weaknesses.

* **Recovery:**  Implementing automatic recovery mechanisms where feasible, such as retries with exponential backoff, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation.  For unrecoverable errors, the system should fail gracefully, providing informative messages to the user.

* **User Feedback:**  Providing clear and informative error messages to the user, avoiding technical jargon whenever possible.  Error messages should guide the user towards potential solutions or further assistance.


**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized for better analysis and handling:

* **API Errors:** Errors encountered during interactions with external APIs (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).  These should include specific HTTP status codes, error messages from the API, and retry attempts.

* **Data Errors:** Errors related to data processing, validation, or inconsistencies.  These include invalid input data, missing data, or data format errors.

* **System Errors:**  Errors related to system resources, such as insufficient memory, disk space issues, or network connectivity problems.

* **Configuration Errors:** Errors due to incorrect configuration settings in the `.env` file or other configuration sources.

* **Internal Errors:** Unexpected exceptions or errors within the application's core logic.  These require thorough investigation and debugging.

* **User Errors:** Errors caused by incorrect user input or actions.  These require clear and concise user-friendly messages.


**3. Error Logging:**

* **Centralized Logging:** Use a centralized logging system (e.g., a dedicated log server or cloud-based logging service) to aggregate logs from all components.

* **Structured Logging:**  Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) to facilitate easier parsing and analysis of logs.

* **Log Levels:**  Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL) to filter and prioritize log messages.

* **Contextual Information:** Include relevant contextual information in log messages, such as timestamps, request IDs, user IDs, input data, and affected components.

* **Error Stack Traces:** Include full stack traces for internal errors to aid debugging.


**4. Error Reporting:**

* **Automated Alerts:**  Set up automated alerts for critical errors (FATAL and ERROR level) to notify the development team immediately.

* **Dashboards:**  Create dashboards to visualize error trends and frequencies over time.

* **Regular Reporting:** Generate regular reports summarizing error occurrences and their impact.


**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Retries with Exponential Backoff:** Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary API outages).

* **Circuit Breakers:** Use circuit breakers to prevent repeated attempts to access failing services.

* **Graceful Degradation:**  In case of partial failures, degrade gracefully to maintain core functionality.

* **Automatic Rollback:**  If a failure is detected in a new release, implement an automatic rollback mechanism to revert to the previous stable version.


**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

* **Configurable Retry Attempts:** Allow the number of retry attempts to be configurable through settings.

* **Exponential Backoff:**  Increase the delay between retry attempts exponentially to avoid overwhelming the failing service.

* **Jitter:**  Add random jitter to the backoff delay to avoid synchronized retry attempts.


**7. Circuit Breakers:**

* **State Management:**  Maintain the state of the circuit breaker (closed, open, half-open).

* **Thresholds:** Define thresholds for the number of failures before opening the circuit.

* **Timeout:**  Define a timeout for the circuit to remain open before attempting to close it.


**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:**  Use clear and concise language, avoiding technical jargon.

* **Actionable:**  Provide suggestions for resolving the error.

* **Consistent Formatting:**  Maintain a consistent format for error messages.


**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Real-time Monitoring:**  Implement real-time monitoring of key metrics, such as API response times, error rates, and resource utilization.

* **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for critical errors and performance issues.


**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide should be created, documenting common errors, their causes, and recommended solutions. This guide should be easily accessible to both users and support staff.


**Specific Considerations for ADPA:**

* **AI Provider Failures:**  Implement robust fallback mechanisms to switch between different AI providers in case one becomes unavailable.

* **Context Management Errors:**  Implement error handling for situations where context loading or processing fails.

* **Document Generation Errors:**  Handle errors during document template processing and content generation.

* **PMBOK Validation Errors:**  Provide detailed reports on any PMBOK compliance violations.

* **Version Control System Errors:**  Handle errors during version control operations (commit, push, pull).


By adhering to these guidelines, ADPA will be more reliable, easier to maintain, and provide a better user experience.  Regular review and updates to these guidelines are essential to adapt to evolving system needs and address emerging issues.
