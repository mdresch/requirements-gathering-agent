## ADPA Error Handling Guidelines

These guidelines outline the error handling strategy for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), aiming for robust system reliability and a positive user experience.  ADPA's architecture, leveraging multiple AI providers and complex document generation processes, necessitates a comprehensive approach to error handling.

**1. Error Handling Strategy:**

ADPA employs a layered error handling strategy, encompassing:

* **Prevention:** Proactive measures to minimize errors through input validation, robust API interactions, and careful resource management.
* **Detection:** Mechanisms to identify errors at various stages, including input parsing, API calls, document generation, and file I/O.
* **Handling:** Graceful degradation and recovery mechanisms to mitigate the impact of errors, including retries, fallbacks, and informative error messages.
* **Logging:** Comprehensive logging to track errors, facilitating debugging, analysis, and post-incident reviews.
* **Reporting:** Mechanisms to notify relevant personnel (developers, operations) of critical errors and system issues.
* **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of key metrics (e.g., error rates, latency, resource utilization) to identify trends and potential problems.


**2. Error Categories:**

Errors are categorized to facilitate targeted handling and analysis:

* **API Errors:** Errors originating from AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), including rate limits, authentication failures, service outages, and invalid requests.
* **Input Errors:** Errors related to invalid or incomplete input data, including malformed README files, missing configuration parameters, and incorrect command-line arguments.
* **Processing Errors:** Errors during document generation, including template parsing errors, AI model failures, and context management issues.
* **File I/O Errors:** Errors related to file reading, writing, and management, including permission issues, disk space limitations, and corrupted files.
* **System Errors:** General system-level errors, such as memory leaks, unexpected crashes, and operating system issues.
* **Validation Errors:** Errors detected during PMBOK compliance validation and document quality assessment.
* **User Errors:** Errors caused by incorrect user input or actions.


**3. Error Logging:**

* **Centralized Logging:** All errors will be logged to a centralized logging system (e.g., using a dedicated logging library like Winston or Bunyan).  This system should support structured logging, including timestamps, error levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL), error messages, stack traces, and relevant context (e.g., command-line arguments, AI provider used, document being generated).
* **Log Levels:**  Appropriate log levels will be used to classify the severity of errors, facilitating efficient filtering and analysis.
* **Log Rotation:** Log files will be rotated to prevent excessive disk space consumption.
* **Log Aggregation:** A log aggregation tool (e.g., Elasticsearch, Graylog) will be used to collect and analyze logs from various sources.


**4. Error Reporting:**

* **Alerting:** Critical errors (FATAL) will trigger alerts via email, SMS, or other notification channels to designated personnel.  These alerts should include concise summaries of the error and relevant context.
* **Error Dashboards:** Dashboards will be created to visualize error rates, trends, and other key metrics, enabling proactive identification and resolution of issues.
* **Incident Management:** A formal incident management process will be followed for critical errors, including incident reporting, investigation, resolution, and post-incident review.


**5. Recovery Procedures:**

* **Retry Mechanisms:**  For transient errors (e.g., network issues, temporary API outages), ADPA will implement retry logic with exponential backoff to increase the chances of successful completion.  The number of retries and backoff strategy should be configurable.
* **Fallback Mechanisms:**  If retries fail, ADPA will employ fallback mechanisms, such as using a different AI provider or generating a simplified version of the document.
* **Circuit Breakers:**  For persistent errors (e.g., API rate limits, service outages), circuit breakers will be used to prevent repeated failed attempts and allow time for the service to recover.
* **Data Recovery:** Mechanisms will be implemented to recover from data loss or corruption, such as using version control systems (Git) and regular backups.


**6. Retry Mechanisms:**

* **Exponential Backoff:** Retries will be implemented using an exponential backoff strategy to avoid overwhelming the failing service.
* **Jitter:**  Random jitter will be added to the backoff to avoid synchronized retries from multiple instances.
* **Maximum Retries:** A maximum number of retries will be set to prevent indefinite retry loops.


**7. Circuit Breakers:**

* **Hystrix or similar:** A circuit breaker pattern (e.g., using Hystrix or a similar library) will be implemented to manage failures from external services.
* **Thresholds:** Circuit breaker thresholds (e.g., error rate, latency) will be configurable.


**8. User Error Messages:**

* **Clear and Concise:** User error messages will be clear, concise, and informative, guiding users towards resolution.
* **Actionable Advice:**  Error messages should provide actionable advice to help users correct the error.
* **Error Codes (optional):**  Error codes may be included for advanced users to facilitate troubleshooting.


**9. Monitoring and Alerts:**

* **Metrics:** Key metrics (error rates, latency, throughput, resource utilization) will be monitored using a monitoring system (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Dashboards:** Dashboards will be created to visualize these metrics and alert on anomalies.
* **Alerting Thresholds:**  Alert thresholds will be defined based on acceptable error rates and service levels.


**10. Troubleshooting Guide:**

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide will be provided to assist users and developers in resolving common errors. This guide will include:

* **Common Error Messages:**  A list of common error messages with explanations and resolution steps.
* **Troubleshooting Steps:**  Step-by-step instructions for resolving specific errors.
* **Log Analysis:** Guidance on interpreting log files to identify the root cause of errors.
* **Advanced Troubleshooting:**  Information for advanced users on debugging and resolving more complex issues.


**Specific Implementation Details:**

Error handling will be implemented using a combination of TypeScript's built-in error handling mechanisms, dedicated error handling libraries, and custom error classes.  Each module will have its own error handling strategy, but all errors will be logged and reported according to the guidelines above.  The specific implementation details will be documented in the codebase.


These guidelines provide a framework for robust error handling in ADPA.  Regular review and updates will ensure continued effectiveness and alignment with evolving project needs.
