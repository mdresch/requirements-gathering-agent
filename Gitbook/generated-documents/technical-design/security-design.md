# Security Design Document: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Security Architect


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the security design for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA RGA), a production-ready Express.js API generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  The design prioritizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad) while adhering to industry best practices and relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, if applicable).  Given the sensitivity of the data processed (potentially including sensitive business information from Fortune 500 companies), a robust security posture is critical.


## 2. Security Overview

The ADPA RGA handles sensitive data and must protect against various threats, including:

* **Unauthorized Access:** Preventing unauthorized individuals from accessing the API and its data.
* **Data Breaches:** Protecting against data exfiltration and modification.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Ensuring the API remains available to legitimate users.
* **Injection Attacks:** Preventing malicious code from being executed through user inputs.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Protecting against attacks that inject client-side scripts.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Preventing unauthorized actions performed on behalf of a logged-in user.


## 3. Authentication Design

The primary authentication mechanism will be API Key-based authentication, supplemented by JWT (JSON Web Token) for potential future enhancements requiring user-specific permissions and granular access control.

* **API Key Management:** API keys will be generated securely and stored in a secure configuration store (e.g., Azure Key Vault).  Keys will have expiration dates and should be rotated regularly.  Key revocation mechanisms will be implemented.
* **JWT Implementation (Future):**  If user-specific functionalities are added, JWTs will be used for session management and authorization.  Keys will be managed securely and protected against unauthorized access.  Token expiration and refresh mechanisms will be implemented.
* **Rate Limiting:**  A rate-limiting mechanism will be implemented to mitigate brute-force attacks and DoS attempts. This will be configurable based on client IP address and API key.


## 4. Authorization Framework

* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  While the current design primarily focuses on API key authentication, a future implementation of RBAC is recommended to handle more granular access control.  Different roles (e.g., administrator, user) will be assigned different permissions to access specific API endpoints and functionalities.


## 5. Data Protection

* **Data at Rest:** Data stored on the server will be encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).  This includes any persistent storage used for API keys, configurations, or temporary files.
* **Data in Transit:** All communication between clients and the API will be secured using HTTPS with TLS 1.3 or higher.
* **Input Validation:**  Strict input validation using a schema validation library (like Zod) will be implemented to prevent injection attacks.  All inputs will be sanitized before processing.
* **Output Encoding:**  Output data will be properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.


## 6. Network Security

* **Firewall:**  The API server will be protected by a firewall to restrict access from untrusted networks.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  Consider implementing an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic for malicious activity.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  A WAF should be deployed to protect against common web application attacks.


## 7. Security Controls

* **Regular Security Audits:**  Regular security audits and penetration testing will be conducted to identify and address vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Automated vulnerability scanning tools will be used to regularly scan the application for known vulnerabilities.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Comprehensive logging will be implemented to track API requests, errors, and security events.  Centralized log management and monitoring will be used to detect suspicious activity.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  A SIEM system should be considered for centralized security monitoring and incident response.


## 8. Threat Modeling

A threat modeling exercise will be performed to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities specific to the ADPA RGA.  This will involve identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and mitigations.  The STRIDE threat model (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege) will be used as a framework.


## 9. Security Testing Strategy

* **Unit Testing:**  Security-focused unit tests will be written to verify the functionality of security controls.
* **Integration Testing:**  Integration tests will verify the interaction between different security components.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Regular penetration testing will be conducted by external security experts to identify vulnerabilities not found through other testing methods.
* **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):**  Automated SAST and DAST tools will be used to identify vulnerabilities in the code and running application.


## 10. Incident Response Plan

An incident response plan will be developed and regularly updated to outline procedures for handling security incidents.  This plan will include steps for detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activity.


## 11. Compliance Requirements

The ADPA RGA will be designed to comply with all applicable regulations, including but not limited to GDPR (if applicable) and other relevant industry standards.  Data privacy and security will be paramount in the design and implementation.


## 12. Future Considerations

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Consider implementing MFA for enhanced security, especially for administrative access.
* **Secrets Management:**  Utilize a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault) for storing and managing sensitive credentials.
* **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM):**  Implement a CSPM tool to monitor the security configuration of cloud resources.


This document provides a high-level overview of the security design.  More detailed design specifications will be developed as the project progresses.  Regular security reviews and updates to this document are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
