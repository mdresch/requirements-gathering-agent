## Security Design Document: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (Security Architect)


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the security design for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA), a Node.js application utilizing various AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to generate project management documentation.  The design prioritizes confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and system resources while adhering to industry best practices and relevant compliance regulations.


**2. Security Overview**

ADPA handles sensitive project data, including potentially confidential business information, technical specifications, and stakeholder details.  The security design focuses on mitigating risks associated with data breaches, unauthorized access, and denial-of-service attacks.  Key security principles include:

* **Least Privilege:**  Granting only necessary permissions to users and system components.
* **Defense in Depth:** Implementing multiple layers of security controls to provide redundancy.
* **Secure Development Lifecycle:** Integrating security practices throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
* **Continuous Monitoring:** Implementing logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.


**3. Authentication Design**

ADPA leverages the authentication mechanisms provided by its underlying AI providers:

* **Azure OpenAI:** Supports Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) integration for Entra ID authentication, providing strong authentication through existing corporate identity systems.  This is the preferred method.  API Key authentication is also supported but is less secure and should be avoided if possible.
* **Google AI:** Uses API keys.  API keys should be stored securely (e.g., using environment variables) and rotated regularly.
* **GitHub AI:** Utilizes GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs). PATs should be scoped to only necessary permissions and stored securely.  Rotation is crucial.
* **Ollama:**  Local deployment, relying on the host system's security for access control.  This necessitates robust host system security measures.

**Recommendation:**  Prioritize Azure AD integration with Azure OpenAI.  For other providers, rigorous key management practices are essential.


**4. Authorization Framework**

Authorization is handled primarily at the AI provider level.  ADPA itself does not manage fine-grained access control beyond what the AI provider enforces.  However, future development could incorporate role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to specific project documentation within the ADPA application itself.


**5. Data Protection**

* **Data at Rest:**  Generated documents are stored locally.  Encryption at rest (e.g., using disk encryption) should be considered, particularly for sensitive projects.
* **Data in Transit:**  Communication with AI providers occurs over HTTPS, ensuring data encryption in transit.
* **Data Minimization:**  ADPA should only collect and process the minimum necessary data to perform its functions.
* **Data Retention:**  A clear data retention policy should be defined and implemented.


**6. Network Security**

* **Input Validation:**  All user inputs should be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
* **Output Encoding:**  Generated documents should be properly encoded to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
* **Firewall:**  If deployed on a server, ADPA should be protected by a firewall to restrict access to authorized ports and IP addresses.


**7. Security Controls**

* **Input Sanitization:**  Strict input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Encoding:**  Encoding of output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implementing rate limiting to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  Keeping all software components (Node.js, dependencies, AI provider SDKs) up-to-date with security patches.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing should be performed.


**8. Threat Modeling**

A threat model should be developed to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities.  This should include:

* **Data Breaches:**  Unauthorized access to project data.
* **Denial-of-Service:**  Overloading the system to prevent legitimate users from accessing it.
* **Injection Attacks:**  Malicious code injected through user input.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Malicious scripts injected into generated documents.
* **API Key Compromise:**  Unauthorized access using stolen API keys.


**9. Security Testing Strategy**

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Analyzing the codebase for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Testing the running application for vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulating real-world attacks to identify vulnerabilities.


**10. Incident Response Plan**

An incident response plan should be developed to outline procedures for handling security incidents.  This should include:

* **Incident Detection:**  Methods for detecting security incidents.
* **Incident Containment:**  Steps to isolate and contain the incident.
* **Incident Eradication:**  Removing the cause of the incident.
* **Incident Recovery:**  Restoring systems and data.
* **Post-Incident Activity:**  Analyzing the incident to prevent future occurrences.


**11. Compliance Requirements**

ADPA should be designed to comply with relevant regulations, such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA (if applicable), and industry-specific standards.  Specific compliance requirements will depend on the data processed and the location of the users and data.

**12. Future Considerations**

* **Enhanced Access Control:** Implement RBAC for granular control over document access.
* **Data Encryption:**  Explore encryption at rest for enhanced data protection.
* **Security Auditing:**  Implement comprehensive security auditing to track system activity.
* **Automated Security Testing Integration:** Integrate SAST and DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline.


This Security Design Document provides a high-level overview.  A more detailed design will be necessary as the project progresses, incorporating specific implementation details and addressing any emerging security concerns.
