## Security Design Document

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Version:** 1.0

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Author:** Security Architect


**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the security design for the ADPA application, focusing on protecting sensitive data, ensuring system integrity, and maintaining user confidentiality.  ADPA's reliance on AI models and access to potentially sensitive project data necessitate a robust security posture.  This design prioritizes defense in depth and incorporates industry best practices.

**2. Security Goals**

* **Confidentiality:** Protect sensitive project data (requirements, specifications, stakeholder information) from unauthorized access.
* **Integrity:** Ensure the accuracy and completeness of generated documents and prevent unauthorized modification.
* **Availability:** Maintain the availability of the ADPA application and its services.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to relevant security regulations and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, SOC 2).
* **Accountability:** Maintain audit trails to track user actions and system events.


**3. Threat Model**

This section identifies potential threats and vulnerabilities to ADPA:

| Threat Agent      | Threat Vector                               | Threat Impact          | Mitigation Strategy                                                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unauthorized User | Network intrusion, compromised credentials | Data breach, data loss | Secure network infrastructure, strong authentication, intrusion detection/prevention system |
| Malicious Insider | Data exfiltration, malicious code injection | Data breach, system compromise | Access control, data loss prevention (DLP), regular security audits                      |
| AI Model Poisoning | Malicious input data                       | Inaccurate outputs, biased results | Input validation, model monitoring, adversarial training                                  |
| Data Leakage       | Unsecured data storage, insecure APIs       | Data breach, regulatory non-compliance | Secure storage, secure API design, encryption                                            |
| Denial of Service  | Flooding of requests                       | Unavailability          | Rate limiting, load balancing, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) mitigation         |


**4. Security Architecture**

ADPA's security architecture employs a multi-layered approach:

**4.1 Authentication and Authorization:**

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandatory for all users accessing ADPA, utilizing a robust MFA provider (e.g., Azure MFA, Google Authenticator).
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Granular access control based on user roles (administrator, developer, user).  Administrators have full access; developers have access to development environments and logs; users have access to the application's core functionality.
* **API Keys/Tokens:**  Securely manage API keys and tokens for accessing external services (AI providers, SharePoint, etc.).  Rotate keys regularly.  Utilize short-lived tokens where possible.
* **Azure Entra ID Integration (Recommended):** Leverage Azure Entra ID for centralized identity management and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities.


**4.2 Data Protection:**

* **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption algorithms (AES-256). This includes data stored in databases, files, and during API communication.
* **Data Masking/Tokenization:** For sensitive data, consider masking or tokenization to protect it even if a breach occurs.
* **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Implement DLP tools to monitor and prevent sensitive data from leaving the system.
* **Secure Storage:** Use a secure storage solution (e.g., Azure Blob Storage with encryption) for storing sensitive data and generated documents.


**4.3 Network Security:**

* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Deploy ADPA within a secure VPC to isolate it from public networks.
* **Firewall:** Implement a robust firewall to control network traffic and prevent unauthorized access.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Monitor network traffic for malicious activity and block suspicious connections.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protect against common web application attacks.


**4.4 Secure Development Practices:**

* **Secure Coding Standards:** Enforce secure coding practices throughout the development lifecycle.  Regular code reviews and penetration testing are essential.
* **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS)).
* **Output Encoding:** Properly encode all outputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies and libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):**  Integrate SAST/DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early.


**4.5 AI Model Security:**

* **Model Monitoring:** Regularly monitor AI models for unexpected behavior or performance degradation, which could indicate poisoning or other attacks.
* **Adversarial Training:** Train models to be resilient to adversarial attacks.
* **Input Sanitization:**  Implement robust input sanitization to mitigate the risk of model poisoning.
* **Model Versioning:** Track and manage model versions to allow rollbacks in case of compromised models.


**4.6 Logging and Monitoring:**

* **Centralized Logging:** Collect logs from all system components in a centralized location for analysis and auditing.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Use a SIEM system to correlate security events and detect threats.
* **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor system performance and security events in real-time to identify and respond to incidents quickly.


**4.7 Incident Response:**

* **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain a comprehensive incident response plan that outlines procedures for handling security incidents.
* **Regular Training:** Train personnel on security awareness and incident response procedures.


**5. Compliance**

ADPA's security design must comply with relevant regulations and standards, including but not limited to:

* GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
* CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
* Other applicable regional or industry-specific regulations


**6. Future Considerations**

* **Zero Trust Security:**  Implement a zero-trust security model to further enhance security by verifying every access request regardless of location.
* **Automated Security Updates:**  Implement automated patching and updates for all system components.
* **Continuous Monitoring and Improvement:**  Regularly review and update the security design based on emerging threats and vulnerabilities.


**7. Appendix**

This section will include detailed technical specifications, diagrams, and other supporting information.


This Security Design Document provides a high-level overview.  Further detail will be provided in subsequent documentation as the project progresses.  Regular security assessments and penetration testing will be conducted throughout the development and operational lifecycle to ensure the continued effectiveness of these security controls.
