## Scope Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It adheres to the PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines and ensures that all project work, and only the necessary work, is included and completed successfully.  This plan will be used to define, validate, control, and manage changes to the project scope.

**2. Scope Management Processes**

The project will utilize the following scope management processes:

* **2.1 Plan Scope Management:** This process defines how the project scope will be managed throughout the project lifecycle.  This includes defining the scope baseline, defining how scope changes will be managed, and identifying the tools and techniques that will be used.  The output of this process will be a Scope Management Plan (this document).

* **2.2 Define Scope:** This process involves clearly defining the project boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  It leverages inputs from the project charter, stakeholder register, requirements documentation, and organizational process assets.  The output will be a detailed Project Scope Statement and a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).

* **2.3 Create WBS:** This process decomposes the project scope into smaller, manageable components (work packages).  The WBS will be hierarchical, providing a clear visual representation of the project work. This will be documented in the WBS and WBS Dictionary.

* **2.4 Validate Scope:** This process formally accepts the deliverables produced by the project.  This involves obtaining sign-off from stakeholders, ensuring the deliverables meet the acceptance criteria defined in the Project Scope Statement.

* **2.5 Control Scope:** This is an ongoing process that monitors the project scope for any unauthorized changes (scope creep).  It involves managing change requests, assessing their impact, and obtaining approval before implementing them.  The process includes a formal change control system.

**3. Scope Baseline**

The scope baseline will consist of the following:

* **Project Scope Statement:**  A formal document that describes the project's objectives, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.  This document will be created and updated as needed.

* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A hierarchical decomposition of the project work into smaller, manageable components.  The WBS will be detailed enough to allow for accurate estimation and tracking of progress.

* **WBS Dictionary:** A document that provides detailed descriptions of each work package in the WBS, including acceptance criteria, responsible parties, and estimated durations.

**4. Scope Change Control Process**

The following process will be used to manage scope changes:

1. **Request for Change (RFC):**  Any proposed change to the scope will be submitted as a formal RFC.  The RFC should clearly describe the proposed change, its impact on the project schedule and budget, and the rationale for the change.

2. **Change Request Evaluation:** The project manager will evaluate the RFC, assessing its impact and feasibility.  This may involve consulting with stakeholders and experts.

3. **Change Approval:** The change request will be submitted to the Change Control Board (CCB) for approval. The CCB will consist of key stakeholders with the authority to approve or reject scope changes.

4. **Change Implementation:** Once approved, the change will be implemented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.

5. **Verification and Validation:**  After implementation, the change will be verified and validated to ensure it meets the required specifications and does not negatively impact other aspects of the project.

**5. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used to manage the project scope:

* **Meetings:** Regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss scope and address any issues.

* **Documentation:**  Maintaining up-to-date documentation of the project scope, WBS, WBS Dictionary, and change requests.

* **Software:** Project management software to track progress, manage tasks, and control changes.

* **Expert Judgment:**  Seeking input from experts to help define the scope and manage changes.

**6. Responsibility Matrix**

**7.  Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete when:

* All deliverables listed in the Project Scope Statement have been completed and formally accepted by stakeholders.
* The project has met all acceptance criteria defined in the WBS Dictionary.
* The project has been successfully closed out according to the Project Closure process.

**8.  Assumptions and Constraints**

* **Assumptions:**  The project team has the necessary skills and experience to complete the project.  Stakeholders will be available to provide timely input and feedback.  The necessary technology and resources will be available.

* **Constraints:** Project budget and timeline are fixed.  External dependencies may impact the project schedule.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes or unforeseen circumstances.  Any deviations from this plan will be managed through the formal scope change control process.
