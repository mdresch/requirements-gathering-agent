## Scope Management Plan

**1. Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**2. Project Manager:** [Project Manager Name]

**3. Date:** October 26, 2023

**4. 1.0 Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for defining, validating, controlling, and managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It ensures that the project delivers the intended functionality and avoids scope creep.

**5. 2.0 Scope Statement**

The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK documentation from a project's README file.  The tool utilizes Azure OpenAI (primarily), with support for other AI providers,  to generate a suite of 28 PMBOK-compliant documents categorized into Core Analysis, Project Charter, Management Plans, Planning Artifacts, Stakeholder Management, and Technical Analysis.  The generated documents are organized within a structured directory.

**6. 3.0 Scope Definition**

**3.1 Project Deliverables:**

The project deliverables include:

*   A functional Node.js application (requirements-gathering-agent).
*   A comprehensive set of 28 PMBOK-compliant project management documents.
*   A well-defined directory structure for organizing the generated documents.
*   Comprehensive documentation (README, this Scope Management Plan, etc.).

**3.2 Project Exclusions:**

*   Support for AI providers beyond those currently specified (Google AI Studio, Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  Adding new providers will be considered as a future enhancement.
*   Integration with other project management tools.
*   Customizability of the generated document templates beyond the current PMBOK standard.
*   Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial release.


**7. 4.0 Scope Verification and Validation**

**4.1 Verification:**

*   Each generated document will be reviewed against the PMBOK standard and the project's requirements.
*   Unit and integration testing will be performed to ensure the application's functionality.
*   A final review of all deliverables will be conducted before release.

**4.2 Validation:**

*   User acceptance testing (UAT) will be performed by a select group of users to validate that the generated documents meet their needs and expectations.
*   Feedback from UAT will be used to identify and address any discrepancies between the delivered documents and the project's scope.

**8. 5.0 Scope Control**

**5.1 Change Control Process:**

Any changes to the project scope will be managed through a formal change control process:

1.  **Change Request:** A formal change request will be submitted, documenting the proposed change, its justification, and its impact on the project schedule, budget, and resources.
2.  **Change Evaluation:** The project manager and stakeholders will evaluate the change request, assessing its feasibility and impact.
3.  **Change Approval:** The change request will be approved or rejected by the appropriate authority.
4.  **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change will be implemented, and the project plan will be updated accordingly.
5.  **Change Verification:** The implemented change will be verified to ensure that it meets the requirements and does not negatively impact other aspects of the project.

**5.2 Scope Baseline:**

The approved project scope statement, WBS, and other relevant documents will constitute the project scope baseline.  Any deviations will be managed through the change control process.

**5.3 Scope Creep Prevention:**

Proactive measures to prevent scope creep include:

*   Clearly defined requirements and acceptance criteria.
*   Regular communication with stakeholders.
*   Strict adherence to the change control process.
*   Regular monitoring of project progress against the scope baseline.


**9. 6.0 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  (A detailed WBS would be included here, breaking down the project into manageable tasks.  This is omitted for brevity but is crucial for a real-world Scope Management Plan).

**10. 7.0  Responsibility Matrix** (A responsibility matrix outlining who is responsible for each task in the WBS would be included here. This is omitted for brevity).

**11. 8.0  Reporting and Monitoring**

Regular progress reports will be provided to stakeholders, highlighting any potential scope issues or risks.  These reports will compare actual progress to the planned scope baseline.

**12. 9.0  Change Log** (A table to track and document all approved changes to the project scope would be included here. This is omitted for brevity).


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The objective is to ensure that the project delivers the intended value while maintaining control over scope, cost, and schedule.
