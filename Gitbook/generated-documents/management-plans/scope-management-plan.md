# Scope Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction  

This **Scope Management Plan** outlines the approach and processes for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. Its purpose is to ensure the project delivers its intended outcomes while avoiding scope creep and aligning with PMBOK standards, stakeholder expectations, and organizational policies.  

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach  

The scope will be managed through formal processes involving scope definition, validation, monitoring, and control. This will include iterative stakeholder engagement, traceability of requirements, and leveraging the project's Enhanced Context Manager and AI capabilities to maintain alignment with project objectives.  

---

## 3. Scope Definition  

### 3.1 Inputs  
The scope definition will be based on:  
- **Project Charter**: High-level scope, objectives, constraints, and assumptions.  
- **Stakeholder Register**: Needs and expectations of stakeholders.  
- **Requirements Documentation**: Functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Organizational Process Assets**: Templates, lessons learned, and documentation standards.  
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors**: Industry standards, regulatory requirements, and available AI technologies.  

### 3.2 Activities  
- **Requirements Workshops**: Conduct sessions with stakeholders to document detailed requirements.  
- **Scope Description**: Define project boundaries, deliverables, features, and exclusions.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Establish criteria for deliverables approval.  
- **Traceability Matrix**: Develop a matrix linking requirements to specific deliverables.  

### 3.3 Outputs  
- **Project Scope Statement**: Comprehensive scope description, including in-scope and out-of-scope items.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Hierarchical decomposition of deliverables into work packages.  
- **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed descriptions of each work package.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Formal criteria for deliverable approval.  

---

## 4. Scope Validation  

### 4.1 Validation Process  
- **Stakeholder Reviews**: Conduct formal reviews of scope documentation with stakeholders.  
- **Acceptance Procedures**: Validate deliverables against acceptance criteria.  
- **Sign-Offs**: Obtain formal approval for the scope statement, WBS, and deliverables from key stakeholders.  

### 4.2 Scope Validation Tools  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent**: Use the AI-powered tool to ensure PMBOK compliance and consistency across scope-related documentation.  
- **Stakeholder Feedback Mechanisms**: Collect feedback through meetings and surveys.  

---

## 5. Scope Control  

### 5.1 Scope Control Activities  
- **Change Control Process**: Use a formal procedure to assess scope changes, including impact analysis and approval requirements.  
- **Monitoring Scope Baseline**: Track progress against the approved scope baseline.  
- **Scope Creep Prevention**: Regularly review deliverables to ensure alignment with the scope statement.  

### 5.2 Tools for Scope Control  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent**: Automated validation of scope-related documents to ensure compliance.  
- **Change Log**: Maintain a log of approved scope changes.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Use metrics to monitor scope adherence and project progress.  

---

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities  

### 6.1 Project Manager  
- Define and document the scope.  
- Validate scope deliverables with stakeholders.  
- Monitor and control scope throughout the project lifecycle.  

### 6.2 Stakeholders

- Review and approve scope-related documents.  
- Provide feedback during scope validation.  

### 6.3 Development Team  
- Implement scope deliverables as defined in the WBS.  
- Report scope-related risks or issues to the Project Manager.  

---

## 7. Scope Baseline  

The scope baseline includes:  
- **Approved Project Scope Statement**: Defines the boundaries and deliverables of the project.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Breakdown of deliverables into manageable work packages.  
- **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed descriptions of each work package.  

Changes to the scope baseline must follow the formal change control process defined in the projectâ€™s Change Management Plan.  

---

## 8. Scope Monitoring and Reporting  

### 8.1 Scope Monitoring  
- Regular review of deliverables against the scope baseline.  
- Use dashboards to track progress on scope-related activities.  

### 8.2 Reporting  
- Weekly scope status updates provided to stakeholders.  
- Detailed scope variance analysis included in monthly project reports.  

---

## 9. Scope Management Metrics  

To monitor the scope effectively, the following metrics will be tracked:  
- **Scope Variance**: Difference between planned and actual scope.  
- **Change Request Frequency**: Number of scope-related change requests submitted and approved.  
- **Deliverable Acceptance Rate**: Percentage of deliverables approved on the first submission.  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Feedback score on scope-related deliverables.  

---

## 10. Scope Management Risks  

### 10.1 Risks  
- **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled expansion of the project scope.  
- **Stakeholder Misalignment**: Lack of agreement on scope definitions and deliverables.  
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Missing or unclear requirements leading to rework.  

### 10.2 Mitigation Strategies  
- Conduct frequent stakeholder reviews to ensure alignment.  
- Use the Requirements Gathering Agent to validate scope documentation and prevent omissions.  
- Employ clear change control processes to manage scope changes effectively.  

---

## 11. Change Control Process
