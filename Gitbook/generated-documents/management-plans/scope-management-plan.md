# Scope Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction  

This Scope Management Plan provides a structured framework for defining, validating, managing, and controlling the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. It aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition standards, ensuring that all project work—and only the work required to successfully complete the project—is included. This plan aims to minimize scope creep, improve stakeholder alignment, and deliver high-quality project outcomes.  

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach  

The scope will be managed through a formalized process involving requirements gathering, scope definition, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) creation, scope validation, and ongoing scope control. The iterative engagement of stakeholders and use of compliant documentation tools will ensure that the project scope remains tightly aligned with stakeholder expectations and organizational objectives.  

### Key Principles:  
- Formal approval of scope changes through a Change Control Process.  
- Regular stakeholder reviews to validate deliverables against scope requirements.  
- Comprehensive traceability from project objectives to deliverables.

## 3. Scope Definition  

### 3.1 Inputs  
The following inputs will be used to define the scope:  
- **Project Charter:** High-level scope, objectives, constraints, and assumptions.  
- **Stakeholder Register:** Stakeholder roles, responsibilities, and needs.  
- **Requirements Documentation:** Functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** Industry standards, regulatory requirements, and organizational policies.  
- **Organizational Process Assets:** Templates, lessons learned, and historical data.  

### 3.2 Activities  
- **Requirements Workshops:** Conduct workshops with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements and expectations.  
- **Scope Statement Development:** Document project deliverables, boundaries, and exclusions.  
- **Acceptance Criteria Definition:** Clearly define criteria for deliverable validation and approval.  
- **In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Identification:** Explicitly outline what is included and excluded in the project scope.  

### 3.3 Outputs  
- **Project Scope Statement:** Comprehensive document outlining deliverables, constraints, assumptions, and exclusions.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Hierarchical decomposition of project work.  
- **WBS Dictionary:** Detailed descriptions of work packages and deliverables.  

---

## 4. Scope Validation  

### 4.1 Validation Process  
- **Stakeholder Reviews:** Conduct formal reviews and walkthroughs of scope deliverables.  
- **Acceptance Criteria Evaluation:** Validate deliverables against the defined acceptance criteria.  
- **Formal Approvals:** Obtain sign-offs from key stakeholders on completed deliverables.  

### 4.2 Tools and Techniques  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent:** Use the project tool to generate PMBOK-compliant scope-related documentation.  
- **Stakeholder Workshops:** Validate scope-related documents in collaboration with stakeholders.  
- **Prototyping:** Create prototypes of core deliverables to gather feedback and validate scope.  

---

## 5. Scope Control  

### 5.1 Scope Monitoring and Tracking  
- **Scope Baseline:** Establish and maintain a baseline of agreed-upon scope components.  
- **Performance Measurement:** Use Earned Value Management (EVM) to monitor scope performance.  
- **Scope Change Requests:** Log, review, and approve/disapprove scope change requests through a formal Change Control Process.  

### 5.2 Tools and Techniques  
- **Scope Management Software:** Utilize the Requirements Gathering Agent for automated scope documentation updates.  
- **Progress Reports:** Regular reporting on scope performance and deviations.  
- **Variance Analysis:** Identify and address discrepancies between planned and actual scope.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities  

### Key Roles  
- **Project Manager:**  
  - Ensure scope alignment with project objectives.  
  - Manage scope changes through formal processes.  
  - Report scope performance to stakeholders.  

- **Business Analyst:**  
  - Facilitate requirements elicitation and workshops.  
  - Document and validate the scope statement and WBS.  

- **Stakeholders:**  
  - Provide requirements and validate deliverables.  
  - Approve scope change requests.  

### Responsibilities Matrix  

| Role               | Responsibility                                    | Approval Authority |  
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------|  
| Project Manager    | Manage overall scope, baseline, and changes.     | Yes                |  
| Business Analyst   | Define and validate scope components.            | No                 |  
| Stakeholders       | Provide requirements and approve deliverables.   | Yes                |  

---

## 7. Scope Change Control Process  

### 7.1 Process Overview  
- **Change Request Submission:** All scope changes must be formally submitted using a Change Request Form.  
- **Impact Analysis:** Evaluate the impact of the change on project deliverables, schedule, budget, and quality.  
- **Approval Process:** Submit change requests for approval to the Change Control Board (CCB).  
- **Scope Baseline Update:** Update scope documentation and communicate changes to all stakeholders.  

### 7.2 Tools and Techniques  
- **Impact Assessment Matrix:** Evaluate and document the impact of scope changes.  
- **Change Log:** Track all requested changes and their statuses.  
- **Automated Notifications:** Use the Requirements Gathering Agent to notify stakeholders of approved changes.

## 8. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  

### 8.1 WBS Hierarchical Structure  
The WBS will be developed to decompose project work into manageable components.  

| Level | Component                       | Description                                           |  
|-------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|  
| 1     | Requirements Gathering Agent    | Entire project scope.                               |  
| 2     | Documentation Modules           | PMBOK-compliant documents generated (e.g., Scope Management Plan, Stakeholder Register). |
