## Scope Management Plan

**1. Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**2. Introduction:** This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for defining, managing, and controlling the scope of the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  It ensures that only the agreed-upon work is performed and that scope creep is minimized.

**3. Scope Statement:** The project aims to develop an AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from a project's README file.  This includes a suite of 28 documents categorized into core analysis, project charter, management plans, planning artifacts, stakeholder management, and technical analysis.  The tool will support multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama).

**4. Scope Baseline:** The scope baseline will be established upon completion of the initial requirements gathering and documented in the approved Project Charter and the detailed WBS (Work Breakdown Structure).  Any changes to the baseline will be formally requested, reviewed, and approved through a Change Control process (detailed below).

**5. Configuration Management:**

* **Configuration Items (CIs):**  Key CIs include the source code, documentation, test scripts, and deployment scripts.  Each CI will be version-controlled using Git.
* **Version Control:**  Git will be used for version control, with a clear branching strategy (e.g., main, develop, feature branches) to manage changes.
* **Change Control:**  All changes to the scope baseline will be formally documented and reviewed using a Change Request process.  This includes assessing the impact on schedule, cost, and resources.  The Change Control Board (CCB), composed of key stakeholders, will approve or reject the change request.


**6. WBS (Work Breakdown Structure):** The WBS will be a hierarchical decomposition of the project into manageable work packages.  A sample WBS is shown below, but it will be further detailed during the planning phase.

* 1.0 Requirements Gathering & Analysis
    * 1.1 Gather User Requirements
    * 1.2 Define Scope
    * 1.3 Develop WBS
* 2.0 Design & Development
    * 2.1 Design API Interactions
    * 2.2 Develop Core Functionality
    * 2.3 Develop AI Provider Integrations
    * 2.4 Develop Command-line Interface
* 3.0 Testing & Quality Assurance
    * 3.1 Unit Testing
    * 3.2 Integration Testing
    * 3.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
* 4.0 Deployment & Release
    * 4.1 Package and Deploy
    * 4.2 Documentation Update
* 5.0 Project Closure


**7. WBS Dictionary:**  The WBS dictionary will provide detailed descriptions of each work package, including responsible parties, estimated effort, and dependencies.

**8. Scope Verification:**  Scope verification will be an ongoing process throughout the project lifecycle.  This will involve regular reviews of deliverables against the scope baseline and the use of inspections and walkthroughs to ensure quality and compliance with requirements.  UAT will be a critical component of scope verification.

**9. Scope Control:**  Scope control involves managing changes to the project scope. This will be managed via the Change Control process described above.  This includes:

* **Change Requests:**  All changes to the scope will be formally submitted as change requests.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):**  The CCB will review and approve or reject change requests based on their impact on the project.
* **Change Implementation:**  Approved changes will be implemented following a defined change management process.
* **Change Tracking:** All changes will be meticulously tracked and documented, updating the scope baseline as needed.

**10.  Acceptance Criteria:** The project will be considered complete when all deliverables specified in the scope statement have been successfully delivered, tested, and accepted by the stakeholders.  This includes successful generation of all 28 PMBOK documents with accurate and relevant content.

**11.  Roles and Responsibilities:**  Clearly defined roles and responsibilities for scope management will be outlined in the project's RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed).

**12.  Reporting:**  Regular progress reports will be submitted to stakeholders, highlighting any scope variances and proposed solutions.

**13.  Tools and Techniques:**  The following tools and techniques will be used for scope management:

*  Microsoft Project (or similar project management software) for WBS creation and tracking.
*  Git for version control.
*  A change management system (e.g., Jira) for managing change requests.
*  Regular meetings and communication with stakeholders.


This Scope Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as the project progresses, ensuring it remains aligned with the evolving needs and circumstances.
