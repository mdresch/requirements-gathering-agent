# Scope Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

The Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope will be defined, validated, and controlled throughout the lifecycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan ensures that all work required—and only the required work—is included in the project to successfully deliver an AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator tool leveraging Azure OpenAI and other AI providers.

---

## 2. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent  
**Project Description:**  
An AI-powered tool that transforms a project’s README file into a comprehensive set of PMBOK-aligned project management documents. It supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama), offers retry logic, and produces professional categorized documentation output.

---

## 3. Scope Management Approach

Scope will be managed through an iterative and controlled process involving:

- Detailed requirements gathering from stakeholders
- Documentation of all scope elements
- Formal scope validation by stakeholders
- Change control procedures to manage scope modifications
- Continuous monitoring to prevent scope creep

---

## 4. Scope Definition

The project scope includes all the work and deliverables required to develop, test, and deploy the Requirements Gathering Agent tool as described below:

### In Scope

- Design and development of the core command-line tool (`requirements-gathering-agent`) in TypeScript
- Integration with AI providers (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama)
- Implementation of features:
  - PMBOK document generation (28 documents)
  - Command line options for selective document generation and retry logic
  - Environment configuration management (`.env` support)
- Documentation and user guides:
  - Installation and usage instructions
  - Configuration examples
  - Authentication procedures
- Output directory structure organization for generated documents
- Robust error handling and retry logic
- Unit and integration testing of core functionalities
- Support for multiple AI authentication methods (Azure Entra ID, API keys, GitHub tokens, Ollama local server)
- Basic UI/UX considerations for CLI usability
- Licensing under MIT
- Contribution guidelines and support channels (issues, discussions)

### Out of Scope

- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) beyond CLI
- Hosting or deployment infrastructure beyond local execution
- Support for AI providers beyond the three listed
- Maintenance and ongoing support post initial release
- Customization for non-PMBOK standards or other project management frameworks
- Translation/localization of the tool and documentation
- Integration with external project management software (e.g., Jira, MS Project)

---

## 5. Deliverables

The following deliverables define the tangible outputs of the project scope:

- Fully functional command-line tool `requirements-gathering-agent`
- Comprehensive PMBOK document suite generation capability (all 28 documents)
- Command line options as specified in requirements
- Environment configuration templates and examples
- User documentation: README, installation guide, usage instructions, authentication setup
- Source code repository with version control
- Automated tests with coverage reports
- Generated output folder structure with categorized documents
- License and contribution guidelines files

---

## 6. Requirements Management

- All requirements will be documented and tracked using GitHub Issues and Project Boards.
- User stories and acceptance criteria will be maintained in the repository under `/core-analysis/` as part of the generated documentation.
- Requirements changes must be submitted as change requests via pull requests or issues.
- Each change request will be reviewed by the project team and stakeholders before approval.
- Impact analysis will be performed for all proposed scope changes to assess cost, schedule, and quality impact.

---

## 7. Scope Validation

- Scope deliverables will be verified through:

  - Code reviews and pull request approvals
  - Functional testing against requirements
  - Stakeholder walkthroughs and demonstrations
  - Review of generated documents for compliance with PMBOK standards

- Formal acceptance will be obtained from the project sponsor and key stakeholders upon successful completion of deliverables.

---

## 8. Scope Control

- The project manager will monitor scope adherence throughout the project.
- Any deviations or scope creep will be identified promptly.
- Changes to the scope baseline must be documented, reviewed, and approved via the Change Control Board (CCB).
- Approved changes will be incorporated into the project plan and communicated to all stakeholders.
- Scope baseline includes:
  - Project scope statement
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  - WBS dictionary

---

## 9. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Overview

A detailed WBS will be created to break down project scope into manageable components, including but not limited to:

1. Project Initiation
2. Requirements Gathering and Analysis
3. Tool Design and Architecture
4. AI Provider Integration
5. Core Feature Development
6. Documentation and Guides
7. Testing and Quality Assurance
8. Deployment and Release
9. Project Closeout

## 10. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role              | Responsibility                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager   | Manage scope, schedule, and stakeholder communication |
| Development Team  | Implement features, fix defects, perform testing |
| QA Team           | Validate deliverables meet quality and requirements |
| Stakeholders      | Provide requirements, review and approve deliverables |
| AI Specialists    | Support integration and configuration of AI providers |

---

## 11. Tools and Techniques

- GitHub for source control, issue tracking, and documentation
- TypeScript and Node.js for development
- Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama for AI functionalities
- Automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest)
- Environment configuration management
- Regular status meetings and reviews

---

## 12. Assumptions and Constraints

**Assumptions**

- Stakeholders will provide timely feedback
- AI provider APIs and services are available and reliable
- Node.js environment is available for users
- Azure CLI is installed for authentication scenarios

**Constraints**

- Project timeline and budget limits the scope of additional features
- Dependency on third-party AI services and their availability
- Security and privacy considerations restrict data handling

---

## 13. Summary

The Scope Management Plan provides the framework to ensure that the Requirements Gathering Agent project delivers all agreed-upon features and documentation, within defined limits, and that any changes are managed and controlled effectively to meet stakeholder expectations and project objectives.
