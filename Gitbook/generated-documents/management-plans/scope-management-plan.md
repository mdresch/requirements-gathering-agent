## Scope Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Scope Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines and ensures that the project delivers the intended functionality while controlling scope creep.

**2. Scope Management Approach**

The RGA project will employ an iterative and incremental scope management approach.  This involves:

* **Progressive Elaboration:**  The project scope will be progressively elaborated throughout the project lifecycle, starting with a high-level definition and refining it with increasing detail as the project progresses. This aligns with the iterative nature of software development and allows for flexibility in response to changing requirements.

* **Stakeholder Collaboration:**  Active and continuous collaboration with stakeholders (developers, project managers, business analysts, and end-users) will be crucial to ensure that the scope remains aligned with their needs and expectations.  Regular feedback loops will be implemented.

* **Formal Change Control:** A formal change control process will be established to manage any changes to the project scope.  All change requests will be documented, evaluated, and approved (or rejected) according to defined criteria.

* **Scope Verification:**  Throughout the project, regular scope verification activities will be conducted to ensure that the work performed aligns with the approved scope.  This includes reviewing deliverables against the acceptance criteria.

**3. Scope Definition**

The project scope is defined by the project's README and related documentation, including the project charter and requirements documents.  Key scope elements include:

* **Core Functionality:**  Generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project README files and related documents.  This includes generating a suite of 29 documents.
* **AI Provider Integration:**  Seamless integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:** Intelligent discovery and analysis of all relevant project documentation for context building.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:**  A 3-phase context strategy to optimize context utilization for different AI models.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:**  Validation of generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **CLI Interface:** A user-friendly command-line interface for easy operation and configuration.
* **Version Control System (VCS):**  A built-in VCS for tracking changes to generated documents.
* **Modular Architecture:** A modular design to facilitate future expansion and maintenance.


**Out of Scope:**

*  Integration with third-party project management software (initially).
*  Support for non-markdown documentation formats (initially).
*  Development of custom AI models.


**4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**

A detailed WBS will be developed to decompose the project scope into manageable work packages.  The WBS will be organized by functional area (e.g., Context Management, AI Integration, Document Generation, CLI Development, Testing).  Each work package will have clearly defined deliverables and acceptance criteria.

**5. Scope Baseline**

The approved project scope statement, WBS, and WBS dictionary will constitute the scope baseline.  Any changes to the baseline will be managed through the formal change control process.

**6. Scope Verification and Control**

* **Regular Reviews:**  Progress against the scope baseline will be reviewed regularly (e.g., weekly or bi-weekly) through meetings and progress reports.

* **Change Requests:**  Any proposed changes to the scope will be submitted as formal change requests.  These requests will be assessed based on their impact on project cost, schedule, and risk.  Approved changes will be documented and incorporated into the scope baseline.

* **Variance Analysis:**  Regular variance analysis will be performed to monitor and control deviations from the scope baseline.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Deliverables will be tested against clearly defined acceptance criteria to ensure they meet the project's requirements.


**7. Change Control Process**

* **Request:**  A formal change request form will be used to document any proposed changes to the scope.
* **Evaluation:** The change request will be evaluated by the project manager and relevant stakeholders.
* **Approval/Rejection:** The change request will be approved or rejected based on its impact and feasibility.
* **Implementation:**  Approved changes will be implemented, and the scope baseline will be updated accordingly.
* **Verification:**  The implemented changes will be verified to ensure they meet the requirements.

**8.  Responsibility Matrix**

A responsibility matrix will be created to clearly define the roles and responsibilities for scope management activities.  This will ensure accountability and efficient workflow.

**9.  Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used to manage project scope:

* Project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana)
* Version control system (Git)
* Document management system
* Communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams)


**10.  Metrics**

The following metrics will be used to monitor and control project scope:

*  % of scope completed
*  Number of change requests
*  Time spent on change requests
*  Cost of changes


This Scope Management Plan provides a framework for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. It will be regularly reviewed and updated as needed to adapt to changing project circumstances.
