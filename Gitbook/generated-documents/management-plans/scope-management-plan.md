# Scope Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Prepared by:**  [Project Manager Name]


## 1. Introduction

This Scope Management Plan details how the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project will be defined, validated, controlled, and verified throughout its lifecycle.  It ensures that all necessary work, and only the necessary work, is included to successfully deliver the project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines and aligning with the approved Project Charter.

## 2. Scope Management Approach

A combination of iterative and incremental approaches will be used for scope management.  This allows for flexibility in adapting to changing requirements and incorporating stakeholder feedback while maintaining a structured and controlled process.

The project will utilize the following PMBOK 7th Edition processes:

* **1.1 Plan Scope Management:**  This plan itself is the output of this process.  It defines how scope will be planned, managed, and monitored.
* **1.2 Define Scope:**  This process will formally document the project scope, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.
* **1.3 Create WBS:**  This process decomposes the project scope into manageable work packages, forming the basis for planning, execution, and control.
* **1.4 Define Activities:** This process will define the individual tasks needed to complete each work package.
* **1.5 Sequence Activities:** This process will establish the dependencies between activities, creating the project schedule network diagram.
* **1.6 Estimate Activity Durations:** This process will estimate the time required for each activity.
* **1.7 Develop Schedule:**  This process will create the project schedule based on activity durations and dependencies.
* **1.8 Control Scope:** This process will manage change requests and ensure that only approved changes are implemented.
* **1.9 Validate Scope:** This process will formally verify that deliverables meet acceptance criteria and obtain stakeholder sign-off.

## 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

### 4.1 WBS Development

The WBS will decompose the project scope into manageable work packages.  A hierarchical decomposition approach will be used, starting with the major deliverables identified in the Project Scope Statement.  The WBS will follow a deliverable-oriented approach, focusing on what needs to be produced rather than how it will be produced.

The WBS will be developed iteratively, with input from the project team and key stakeholders. The initial WBS will be a high-level overview, with greater detail added as the project progresses.  The WBS will be visually represented using a hierarchical chart.

### 4.2 WBS Dictionary

A WBS Dictionary will be created to provide detailed descriptions of each work package in the WBS, including:

* **Work Package ID:**  Unique identifier for each work package.
* **Work Package Description:**  Detailed description of the work to be performed.
* **Deliverables:**  Specific outputs of the work package.
* **Responsible Party:**  Individual or team responsible for the work package.
* **Estimated Duration:**  Estimated time to complete the work package.
* **Estimated Cost:**  Estimated cost to complete the work package.
* **Resources:**  Resources required to complete the work package.
* **Dependencies:**  Dependencies on other work packages.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Criteria for accepting the completion of the work package.

### 4.3 WBS Approval

The WBS and WBS Dictionary will be reviewed and approved by the Project Manager, key stakeholders, and the Project Sponsor.


## 5. Verification and Acceptance of Deliverables

### 5.1 Formal Verification

A formal verification process will be used to ensure that each deliverable meets its defined acceptance criteria.  This will involve:

* **Inspections:** Formal reviews of documents and code.
* **Testing:** Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) will be performed.
* **Demonstrations:** Regular demonstrations of the software to stakeholders.

### 5.2 Formal Acceptance

Formal acceptance of deliverables will be obtained from the relevant stakeholders through documented sign-off processes and approval meetings.  Acceptance criteria for each deliverable are defined in the Project Scope Statement and the WBS Dictionary.

## 6. Scope Change Control

### 6.1 Change Request Process

All requests for scope changes must be submitted using a formal Change Request form. The form will include:

* **Change Request ID:** Unique identifier for the change request.
* **Description of Change:** Clear description of the proposed change.
* **Reason for Change:** Justification for the change.
* **Impact Assessment:** Assessment of the impact of the change on schedule, cost, and resources.
* **Proposed Solution:**  Proposed solution to implement the change.
* **Requested By:** Individual or team requesting the change.
* **Date Submitted:** Date the change request was submitted.

### 6.2 Change Control Board (CCB)

A Change Control Board (CCB) consisting of the Project Manager, Product Owner, and key stakeholders will review and approve or reject all change requests.

### 6.3 Change Implementation

Approved changes will be incorporated into the project scope baseline, WBS, and other relevant project documents.  The impact of the change on the schedule and budget will be assessed and documented.

### 6.4 Change Communication

All stakeholders will be informed of approved scope changes and their impact on the project.

## 7. Scope Management Tools
