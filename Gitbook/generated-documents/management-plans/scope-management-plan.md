# Scope Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope will be defined, developed, monitored, controlled, and verified for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. The project aims to deliver an AI-powered requirements gathering and PMBOK documentation generator supporting multiple AI providers for enterprise-grade project management automation.

The plan ensures all stakeholders have a clear understanding of what is included and excluded from the project, providing a baseline for scope control and change management.

---

## 2. Project Scope Description

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project will deliver a software tool that:

- Supports multiple AI providers for flexibility and reliability, including Azure OpenAI (with Entra ID or API Key), GitHub AI Models, Ollama (local AI), and Azure AI Studio.
- Provides strategic planning features such as project vision, mission, core values, purpose statements, user roles, needs, process identification, technology stack analysis, and automatic PMBOK document generation.
- Generates PMBOK-compliant documentation across Initiating and Planning Process Groups, including but not limited to:
  - Project Charter
  - Stakeholder Register
  - Scope Management Plan
  - Requirements Management Plan
  - Schedule Management Plan
  - Cost Management Plan
  - Quality Management Plan
  - Resource Management Plan
  - Communications Management Plan
  - Risk Management Plan
  - Procurement Management Plan
  - Stakeholder Engagement Plan
- Provides detailed planning artifacts such as WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Activity Duration Estimates, Activity Resource Estimates, Schedule Network Diagram, and Milestone List.
- Includes additional analysis and considerations such as technology stack recommendations, risk analysis, compliance considerations, and UI/UX design guidelines.
- Supports local and cloud AI model usage with fallback and modular architecture.
- Offers CLI and programmatic interfaces for document generation.
- Is designed for enterprise and scalable use cases, including integration into existing Node.js/TypeScript projects.

---

## 3. Project Deliverables

- Fully functional Requirements Gathering Agent software package (npm module and source code).
- AI provider integration modules supporting Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama, and Azure AI Studio.
- PMBOK-aligned documentation generation modules and templates.
- CLI tool for direct document generation.
- User and technical documentation (installation, configuration, usage guides).
- Sample generated PMBOK documents (project charter, scope management plan, stakeholder register, etc.).
- Automated scripts for generating and exporting project documentation.
- Environment configuration files and examples.

---

## 4. Project Boundaries (In-Scope / Out-of-Scope)

### In-Scope

- Development of AI integration modules with specified providers.
- Development of strategic planning and requirements gathering features.
- Automatic generation of PMBOK-compliant documentation.
- CLI and programmatic interfaces for document generation.
- Support for multi-provider fallback and modular architecture.
- Environment and security configuration for enterprise use.
- Documentation and examples to support adoption.

### Out-of-Scope

- Development of AI models themselves (only integration and usage).
- Hosting or deployment of the tool as a SaaS product.
- Support for AI providers other than specified (unless future scope).
- Detailed training or consulting services on PMBOK methodology.
- Integration with third-party project management tools or platforms beyond provided CLI and npm module interfaces.
- UI/UX beyond basic CLI and programmatic usage.

---

## 5. Requirements Management

- All requirements will be documented, analyzed, and prioritized using the integrated requirements gathering features.
- Requirements traceability will be maintained between user needs, processes, and generated PMBOK documentation.
- Changes to requirements will be formally requested and evaluated through the Change Control Process (see Section 9).

## 6. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Overview

The project will be decomposed into major deliverable-oriented components:

1. **AI Provider Integration**
   - Azure OpenAI (Entra ID & API Key)
   - GitHub AI Models
   - Ollama Local AI
   - Azure AI Studio

2. **Strategic Planning Module**
   - Vision, mission, core values generation
   - User roles and needs identification
   - Technology stack analysis

3. **PMBOK Documentation Generator**
   - Initiating Process Group documents
   - Planning Process Group documents
   - Detailed planning artifacts

4. **CLI Tool Development**

5. **Documentation and Examples**

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance**

7. **Packaging and Deployment**

---

## 7. Scope Verification

- Deliverables will be reviewed and accepted by the project sponsor and key stakeholders.
- Verification will include demonstration of AI-powered document generation for sample projects.
- Documentation and modules must pass acceptance criteria including:
  - Correct support of specified AI providers.
  - Accurate PMBOK-compliant document generation.
  - Usability of CLI and programmatic interfaces.
  - Compliance with security and environment configuration requirements.

---

## 8. Scope Control

- The scope baseline includes the detailed deliverables and work packages defined above.
- All requested changes impacting scope will undergo formal change control.
- Scope changes must be documented, analyzed for impact on schedule, cost, and quality, and approved by the Change Control Board (CCB).
- Unapproved scope changes will be deferred.
- Progress will be monitored via regular status reports and milestone reviews.

---

## 9. Change Control Process

- Change requests are submitted using a standardized Change Request Form.
- The Change Control Board, comprising the Project Manager, Sponsor, and Technical Lead, reviews each request.
- Impact analysis includes effects on schedule, budget, quality, and resources.
- Approved changes are incorporated into project scope and baseline documentation.
- All changes are communicated to the project team and stakeholders.
