  - Project deliverables documented, including core features, PMBOK-compliant artifacts, and CLI functionalities.  
  - Acceptance criteria for deliverables aligned with industry standards and stakeholder expectations.  
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) developed, breaking down the project into manageable components.  

- **Scope Validation:**  
  - Regular alignment meetings with stakeholders to confirm deliverable acceptance criteria.  
  - Validation of generated documents against PMBOK standards.  
  - Stakeholder feedback incorporated into iterative scope refinement.  

- **Scope Control:**  
  - Scope creep monitored and mitigated using formal change control processes.  
  - Traceability matrix maintained, linking requirements to deliverables.  
  - Continuous updates to the scope management plan to reflect stakeholder needs and project changes.

### 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Progress  
#### WBS Overview:  
The WBS is hierarchically structured into five key deliverable categories:  
1. **Core Analysis:** Business requirements, user personas, stakeholder needs analysis.  
2. **Planning Artifacts:** WBS, scope, requirements, risk, and communication management plans.  
3. **Project Charter:** Formal authorization and high-level objectives.  
4. **Stakeholder Management:** Stakeholder register and engagement strategies.  
5. **Technical Analysis:** Architecture, technology stack, compliance, and risk analysis.  

#### WBS Progress Highlights:  
- The WBS Dictionary is 95% complete, with detailed descriptions for all work packages.  
- Activity duration estimates have been finalized for 85% of activities.  
- Dependencies identified and documented in a schedule network diagram.  
- Final milestone list pending stakeholder approval.  

#### WBS Challenges:  
- **Dependency Management:** Coordination between document generation and AI provider integration caused delays in some activities.  
- **Stakeholder Feedback:** Additional reviews required for technical artifacts, delaying milestones.
