# Quality Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Prepared by:**  [Your Name/Team]


## 1. Introduction

This Quality Management Plan outlines the processes, procedures, and activities to ensure the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project delivers high-quality deliverables that meet stakeholder expectations and comply with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  It addresses quality objectives, assurance, control, improvement, and risk management, ensuring comprehensive quality coverage throughout the project lifecycle.


## 2. Quality Objectives

The primary quality objectives for the RGA project are:

* **Accuracy:** Generated documents must be at least 95% accurate in their representation of PMBOK standards and input data.  Inaccuracies will be tracked and analyzed to identify root causes.
* **Completeness:** All required elements of each PMBOK document type must be present.  A completeness checklist will be used for validation.
* **Consistency:** Terminology, formatting, and structure must be consistent across all generated documents.  A style guide will be created and enforced.
* **Usability:** The CLI interface must be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear instructions and error messages. User feedback will be actively solicited.
* **Reliability:** The system must consistently generate documents without errors, handling Azure AI service outages and fallback providers gracefully.  Monitoring and error logging will be implemented.
* **Security:** The system must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data, protecting API keys and user data.  Security audits and penetration testing will be considered.
* **Compliance:** All generated documents must comply with relevant regulatory standards and PMBOK guidelines.  Compliance checks will be conducted throughout the project.
* **Performance:** The system must perform efficiently, generating documents in a reasonable timeframe (under 30 seconds per document on average).  Performance testing will be conducted.
