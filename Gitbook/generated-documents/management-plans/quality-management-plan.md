# Quality Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2025

**Version:** 1.0


## 1. Introduction

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the processes and procedures for ensuring the quality of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  It defines how quality will be planned, managed, controlled, and improved throughout the project lifecycle.  Given ADPA's unique AI-driven nature, this plan emphasizes continuous monitoring, iterative improvement, and robust validation against both functional and PMBOK 7.0 standards.

## 2. Quality Management Approach

ADPA's quality management will employ a proactive and iterative approach, integrating quality checks throughout the development lifecycle. This includes:

* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):** Automated testing and deployment pipelines will ensure early detection and resolution of defects.
* **Automated Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests will be implemented to verify functionality and performance.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:**  A dedicated validation module ensures generated documents adhere to PMBOK standards.  This includes checking for completeness, consistency, and the appropriate use of terminology.
* **Quality Metrics:** Key metrics such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency of generated documents will be tracked and analyzed.
* **User Feedback:**  Regular user feedback will be collected through surveys, beta testing, and community engagement.
* **Iterative Refinement:**  Based on testing and feedback, the system will undergo continuous improvement through iterative development cycles.  This includes refining AI prompts, improving templates, and enhancing the context management system.
* **Documentation Quality:**  The quality of the ADPA's own generated documentation will be a primary indicator of its overall performance.

## 3. Quality Standards

* **PMBOK 7.0:** All generated project management documents will adhere to PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Accuracy:** Generated documents must be factually accurate and free from misinformation.  This relies heavily on the Evaluative Contextual Synthesis engine.
* **Completeness:** All required information for each document type will be included.
* **Consistency:**  Terminology and formatting will be consistent across all generated documents.
* **Usability:** Generated documents will be easy to understand and use.
* **Timeliness:**  Documents will be generated and delivered within acceptable timeframes.
* **Code Quality:** The ADPA codebase will adhere to established coding standards and best practices (TypeScript, etc.).  This includes comprehensive unit testing and code reviews.

## 4. Quality Control

Quality control activities will be integrated into each phase of the project lifecycle:

* **Requirements Gathering:**  Thorough review and validation of project requirements.
* **Design:**  Code reviews, design walkthroughs, and prototype testing.
* **Development:**  Unit testing, integration testing, and continuous integration.
* **Testing:**  System testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), and PMBOK compliance validation.
* **Deployment:**  Automated deployment pipelines and monitoring.
* **Maintenance:**  Ongoing monitoring and bug fixing.

## 5. Quality Assurance

Quality assurance activities will focus on:

* **Test Planning:**  Developing comprehensive test plans that cover all aspects of the system.
* **Test Execution:**  Rigorous execution of test plans by independent QA personnel.
* **Defect Tracking:**  Using a defect tracking system to manage and resolve identified issues.
* **Reporting:**  Regular reporting on the status of quality control and assurance activities.
* **Continuous Improvement:**  Regular review and improvement of quality processes.

## 6. Quality Metrics

The following metrics will be used to track and measure the quality of the ADPA project:

* **Defect Density:**  Number of defects per thousand lines of code.
* **Test Coverage:**  Percentage of code covered by unit tests.
* **PMBOK Compliance Rate:** Percentage of generated documents that meet PMBOK standards.
* **Accuracy Rate:** Percentage of factual accuracy in generated documents.
* **User Satisfaction:** Measured through surveys and feedback.
* **Context Utilization Rate:** Percentage of available context used by the Enhanced Context Manager.  This is a crucial metric for large language model performance.

## 7. Quality Improvement

Continuous improvement will be achieved through:

* **Regular Reviews:**  Regular review of quality metrics and processes to identify areas for improvement.
* **Root Cause Analysis:**  Conducting root cause analysis of defects to prevent recurrence.
* **Process Improvement:**  Implementing changes to processes to improve quality.
* **Training:**  Providing training to team members on quality management processes.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for project quality.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for coding standards, unit testing, and code reviews.
* **QA Team:** Responsible for test planning, execution, and defect tracking.
* **AI Specialist:** Responsible for AI model selection, prompt engineering, and performance tuning.


## 9. Tools and Techniques

* **Test Management Software:**  Jira, Azure DevOps, etc.
* **Code Review Tools:**  GitHub, GitLab, etc.
* **CI/CD Pipelines:**  GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps Pipelines, etc.
* **PMBOK Validation Tools:**  Custom-built module integrated into ADPA.
* **AI Model Monitoring Tools:**  Cloud provider-specific monitoring and logging.



This Quality Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the project scope, requirements, and technologies.  The iterative and continuous improvement nature of this plan is crucial to leveraging the full potential of ADPA's AI-powered capabilities.
