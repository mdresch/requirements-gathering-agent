# Quality Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the approach, processes, and standards to ensure that the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project meets its quality objectives. The plan defines quality policies, roles, responsibilities, quality assurance, and control activities to deliver a product that satisfies stakeholder expectations and complies with applicable standards, including PMBOK guidelines.

## 2. Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Requirements Gathering Agent  
- **Project Description:** AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator using Azure OpenAI that transforms project README files into comprehensive PMBOK documentation.  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Generates 28 PMBOK-compliant documents  
  - Integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama)  
  - Enterprise-ready with robust error handling and retry logic  
  - Developed in modern TypeScript  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Complete PMBOK document suite with categorized directory structure  
  - CLI tool with multiple options and configuration support  
  - Comprehensive developer documentation and support resources  

---

## 3. Quality Objectives

The project will meet quality objectives by ensuring:

- **Conformance to Requirements:** All generated PMBOK documents must meet the documented content, format, and structure standards as per PMBOK guidelines.  
- **Reliability:** The tool must function consistently across supported environments (Node.js 18+, Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  
- **Usability:** The CLI interface should be intuitive and provide clear feedback and error messages.  
- **Performance:** Document generation should complete within acceptable time limits with efficient resource utilization.  
- **Maintainability:** Codebase should be modular, well-documented, and following TypeScript best practices.  
- **Security:** Authentication mechanisms (Azure OpenAI Entra ID, API keys) must be implemented securely, safeguarding credentials and user data.  
- **Compliance:** Adherence to open-source licensing (MIT) and relevant organizational policies.

## 6. Quality Management Approach

### 6.1 Quality Assurance (QA)

- **Process Definition:** Adhere to PMBOK quality management processes and organizational standards.  
- **Standards Compliance:** Follow PMBOK documentation standards for generated documents.  
- **Process Audits:** Conduct regular reviews of development and testing procedures to ensure adherence.  
- **Training:** Provide team training on PMBOK standards, TypeScript best practices, and security protocols.  
- **Continuous Improvement:** Capture lessons learned and implement improvements iteratively.

### 6.2 Quality Control (QC)

- **Code Reviews:** Mandatory peer reviews on all code changes using GitHub pull request workflows.  
- **Static Code Analysis:** Use ESLint and Prettier for code style and error detection.  
- **Automated Testing:**  
  - Unit tests for all modules  
  - Integration tests for AI provider integrations and CLI interactions  
  - End-to-end tests for full document generation scenarios  
- **Manual Testing:**  
  - Usability testing of CLI options  
  - Verification of generated document content and structure  
- **Performance Testing:** Measure document generation times and system resource usage.  
- **Defect Tracking:** All defects logged, prioritized, and resolved via GitHub Issues.  
- **Release Validation:** Final acceptance testing before releases including regression testing.
