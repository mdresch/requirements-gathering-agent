# Quality Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the processes, procedures, and standards for ensuring the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) software project delivers a high-quality product that meets stakeholder needs and complies with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  This plan focuses on building a robust, reliable, and user-friendly tool that accurately generates PMBOK-compliant project documentation.

**2. Quality Standards**

* **PMBOK 7th Edition:** The project will adhere to the guidelines and best practices outlined in the PMBOK 7th Edition for all aspects of project management, including quality management.
* **ISO 9126:**  Software quality characteristics (Functionality, Reliability, Usability, Efficiency, Maintainability, Portability) will be considered and addressed throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Coding Standards:**  The development team will follow established coding standards (e.g., consistent naming conventions, commenting practices, code style guidelines) to ensure code readability, maintainability, and testability.  Specific standards will be documented in a separate coding style guide.
* **JSON Schema Validation:** Generated JSON output will be validated against a predefined schema to ensure data integrity and compliance with the expected PMBOK document structures.


**3. Quality Objectives**

* **Accuracy:**  Generated PMBOK documents must accurately reflect the project information provided, minimizing errors and omissions.  A target accuracy rate of 98% will be aimed for, measured through manual verification of a sample of generated documents.
* **Completeness:** All required elements of each PMBOK document type must be included in the generated output.  Completeness will be verified using checklists and automated validation tools.
* **Consistency:**  Generated documents should maintain consistent terminology, formatting, and structure across the entire suite of outputs.  Consistency will be checked through automated cross-reference validation and manual review.
* **Usability:** The RGA CLI should be intuitive and easy to use, with clear instructions and error handling. Usability will be evaluated through user testing and feedback.
* **Reliability:** The RGA tool should be stable and reliable, minimizing crashes and unexpected errors. Reliability will be measured by tracking the frequency of errors and successful runs.
* **Performance:** The RGA tool should generate documents within acceptable timeframes, taking into account the complexity of the input and the AI model used. Performance will be measured by recording generation times for different input sizes.
* **Security:** The tool must securely handle sensitive data and integrate with Azure AI services using best security practices.  Security will be verified through code reviews, penetration testing, and adherence to security standards.
* **PMBOK Compliance:** Generated documents must comply with the structure and content requirements specified in the PMBOK 7th Edition.  Compliance will be assessed through both automated validation and manual review against the standard.


**4. Quality Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for quality management, ensuring the QMP is implemented and adhered to.
* **Business Analyst:** Responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of requirements and their reflection in the generated documents.
* **Software Architect:** Responsible for the design and implementation of the RGA tool, ensuring adherence to coding standards and security best practices.
* **Software Developers:** Responsible for writing high-quality, well-documented code that meets the defined standards.
* **QA Lead/Testers:** Responsible for developing and executing test plans, conducting user testing, and reporting on quality issues.


**5. Quality Deliverables and Processes**

* **Coding Style Guide:** A document outlining coding standards and conventions for the development team.
* **JSON Schema:** A schema defining the structure and data types for the generated JSON output.
* **Test Plan:** A comprehensive document outlining the testing strategy, test cases, and acceptance criteria.
* **Test Cases:** Individual test cases designed to verify specific aspects of the RGA tool's functionality.
* **User Documentation:** Clear and concise instructions on how to use the RGA CLI.
* **Quality Reports:** Regular reports summarizing the results of quality control and assurance activities.


**6. Quality Control Activities**

* **Code Reviews:** Regular peer reviews of code to identify defects and ensure adherence to coding standards.
* **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components of the RGA tool to ensure they function correctly.
* **Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction between different components of the RGA tool.
* **System Testing:** Testing the entire RGA tool to ensure it meets the defined requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by end-users to ensure the tool meets their needs and is user-friendly.
* **JSON Schema Validation:** Automated validation of generated JSON output against the predefined schema.
* **PMBOK Compliance Checks:**  Manual and automated checks to ensure generated documents meet PMBOK standards.


**7. Quality Assurance Activities**

* **Quality Audits:** Regular audits of the project processes and deliverables to identify areas for improvement.
* **Process Improvement:** Implementing changes to project processes based on the findings of quality audits and other feedback.
* **Training:** Providing training to the development team on quality management principles and processes.


**8. Quality Improvement Approaches**

* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):**  Implementing a CI/CD pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process, facilitating early detection and resolution of defects.
* **Defect Tracking and Management:**  Utilizing a defect tracking system to track, prioritize, and resolve identified defects.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** Investigating the root causes of defects to prevent recurrence.


**9. Quality Tools and Techniques**

* **Defect Tracking System (e.g., Jira):** For tracking and managing defects.
* **Version Control System (e.g., Git):** For managing code changes and collaboration.
* **Automated Testing Frameworks (e.g., Jest):** For automating unit and integration tests.
* **JSON Schema Validator:** For validating the structure and data types of generated JSON output.
* **PMBOK Compliance Checker (Custom Tool):**  A tool (potentially leveraging AI) to verify compliance with PMBOK standards.


**10. Quality Metrics and Acceptance Criteria**

* **Defect Density:** Number of defects per thousand lines of code.  Target: Less than 2 defects/KLOC.
* **Test Coverage:** Percentage of code covered by unit and integration tests. Target: 80% or higher.
* **UAT Pass Rate:** Percentage of UAT test cases passed. Target: 95% or higher.
* **PMBOK Compliance Score:** Percentage of PMBOK elements present in each generated document. Target: 100%.
* **Accuracy Rate:** Percentage of information correctly generated in a sample of documents. Target: 98%.
* **User Satisfaction Score:**  Measured through surveys and feedback following UAT. Target: 4 out of 5 stars or higher.
