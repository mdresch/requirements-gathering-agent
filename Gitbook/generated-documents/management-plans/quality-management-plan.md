# Quality Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) defines the approach, processes, and standards for ensuring the quality of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project deliverables. This plan aligns with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide, 7th Edition) and incorporates best practices for quality assurance and control to meet or exceed stakeholder expectations.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this QMP is to:

- Define quality objectives and standards for the project.
- Outline quality roles and responsibilities.
- Specify quality assurance and quality control activities.
- Establish metrics, tools, and techniques to monitor and improve quality.
- Ensure deliverables meet requirements for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.

## 3. Project Quality Objectives

| Objective                                   | Description                                                                 | Measurement Criteria                             |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Deliver defect-free documentation generation | All generated PMBOK documents and requirements artifacts must be syntactically and semantically correct | Zero critical defects; < 2% minor defects        |
| Ensure AI-generated content accuracy        | AI outputs must be relevant, accurate, and aligned with user inputs and PMBOK standards | ≥ 95% accuracy based on peer review and validation |
| Maintain system reliability                  | The system must provide consistent AI provider fallback without downtime or data loss | 99.9% uptime; fallback success rate ≥ 99%       |
| Comply with enterprise security standards   | Use of secure authentication (e.g., Azure Entra ID) and data privacy compliance | Security audit passed; no data breaches          |
| Achieve high user satisfaction               | Users report ease of use, clarity, and completeness of generated documents | ≥ 90% positive user feedback                      |

## 4. Quality Standards and Requirements

- **PMBOK Compliance**: All project documentation must adhere to PMBOK guidelines.
- **Coding Standards**: TypeScript code must follow industry best practices and internal style guides.
- **AI Provider Integration**: Must support multi-provider AI with fallback mechanisms ensuring service continuity.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Generated documents must be reviewed for correctness and completeness.
- **Security Standards**: Follow Azure security best practices and general data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.).
- **Performance**: Document generation should meet defined response times (e.g., < 10 seconds for typical requests).

## 5. Quality Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                  | Responsibilities                                   |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager       | Oversees quality planning, monitoring, and control. Ensures resources are available for quality activities. |
| Quality Assurance (QA) Lead | Develops QA processes, performs audits, and manages quality improvement activities. |
| Development Team      | Implements coding standards, performs unit testing, fixes defects. |
| AI Model Specialist   | Validates AI prompt quality, monitors AI output relevance and accuracy. |
| Security Officer      | Ensures compliance with security standards and audits. |
| Documentation Specialist | Reviews generated documentation for completeness, accuracy, and adherence to PMBOK. |
| Stakeholders          | Provide input on quality expectations and validate deliverables. |

## 6. Quality Management Approach

### 6.1 Quality Planning

- Define quality criteria based on project scope and stakeholder requirements.
- Establish standards for AI-generated content, including formatting and content accuracy.
- Develop checklists and templates for document review.
- Define acceptance criteria for deliverables.
- Plan for iterative reviews and feedback cycles.

### 6.2 Quality Assurance (QA)

- Conduct process audits to ensure adherence to coding and documentation standards.
- Review AI prompts and outputs regularly to improve model accuracy.
- Validate integration with AI providers, ensuring fallback mechanisms work correctly.
- Perform security audits focusing on authentication and data access.
- Implement continuous integration (CI) pipelines with automated testing.

### 6.3 Quality Control (QC)

- Execute peer reviews of generated documents.
- Use automated tools to detect formatting and syntactic errors.
- Monitor AI output consistency and flag anomalies.
- Track defects and issues in a project management tool.
- Perform regression testing after changes or updates.
- Collect user feedback and log quality-related incidents.
