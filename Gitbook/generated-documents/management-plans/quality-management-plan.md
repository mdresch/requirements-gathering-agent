## Quality Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This Quality Management Plan (QMP) outlines the processes, procedures, and standards that will be used to ensure the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project delivers high-quality deliverables that meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  This plan aligns with the PMBOK Guide's guidelines for quality management.

**2. Project Scope**

The scope of this QMP encompasses all aspects of the RGA project, including:

* **Software Development:**  The design, coding, testing, and deployment of the RGA application.
* **Documentation:** The creation of all associated documentation, including this QMP, user manuals, and technical documentation.
* **Deployment:**  The successful rollout and integration of the RGA into the target environment.

**3. Quality Standards**

The following standards will guide the quality assurance activities:

* **PMBOK Guide:** The project will adhere to the principles and best practices defined in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) Guide.
* **Coding Standards:**  The development team will follow established coding standards (e.g., TypeScript coding style guides) to ensure code readability, maintainability, and consistency.
* **Testing Standards:**  Testing will be conducted using established methodologies (e.g., unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing) to identify and resolve defects.
* **Documentation Standards:**  All documentation will adhere to a consistent style and format, ensuring clarity and ease of use.

**4. Quality Control Processes**

The following quality control processes will be implemented:

* **Code Reviews:** Peer code reviews will be conducted to identify potential defects and ensure adherence to coding standards.
* **Unit Testing:**  Developers will write unit tests for all code modules to verify functionality and identify defects early in the development cycle.
* **Integration Testing:**  Integration testing will verify the interaction between different modules and components.
* **System Testing:**  System testing will verify that the entire system meets the specified requirements.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  UAT will be conducted by representative end-users to ensure the system meets their needs and expectations.
* **Documentation Reviews:**  All documentation will be reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and clarity.
* **Defect Tracking and Management:**  A defect tracking system will be used to track, manage, and resolve identified defects.  This system will include prioritization, assignment, and status updates.

**5. Quality Assurance Activities**

The following quality assurance activities will be performed:

* **Quality Audits:** Periodic audits will be conducted to review the effectiveness of the quality management processes.
* **Metrics Collection and Analysis:**  Key quality metrics will be collected and analyzed to identify areas for improvement.  These metrics will include defect density, test coverage, and customer satisfaction.
* **Process Improvement:**  Based on the results of audits and metric analysis, continuous improvement initiatives will be implemented to enhance the effectiveness of the quality management processes.

**6. Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for the quality management of the project.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for ensuring code quality through adherence to coding standards and conducting unit testing.
* **Testing Team:** Responsible for conducting integration, system, and UAT testing.
* **Documentation Team:** Responsible for creating and reviewing all project documentation.

**7. Quality Metrics**

The following quality metrics will be tracked:

* **Defect Density:**  Number of defects per unit of code.
* **Test Coverage:**  Percentage of code covered by unit tests.
* **Defect Resolution Time:**  Time taken to resolve identified defects.
* **Customer Satisfaction:**  Measured through feedback surveys and other means.

**8. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used to support quality management:

* **Defect Tracking System (e.g., Jira, Azure DevOps):** For tracking and managing defects.
* **Version Control System (e.g., Git):** For managing code changes and ensuring code integrity.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline:** For automated building, testing, and deployment of the software.
* **Automated Testing Frameworks:** For automating unit and integration tests.

**9. Quality Improvement**

Regular reviews of the Quality Management Plan will be conducted to identify areas for improvement.  Lessons learned from each phase of the project will be documented and used to improve future projects.

**10. Acceptance Criteria**

The RGA will be considered acceptable if it meets all of the following criteria:

* All planned features are implemented and function correctly.
* All identified defects have been resolved.
* The RGA meets or exceeds user expectations.
* All documentation is complete and accurate.


This Quality Management Plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.
