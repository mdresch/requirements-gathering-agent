# Requirements Documentation: Requirements Gathering Agent

**Document ID:** RD-RGA-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** Bard (AI-assisted)


## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) software project.  The RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to automate the generation of comprehensive project management documentation conforming to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  This documentation will serve as the basis for design, development, testing, and implementation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

The RGA shall:

* **2.1. Project Context Analysis:**  Analyze provided project context, including but not limited to:
    * README.md files
    * Other markdown files within specified directories (e.g., `requirements/`, `docs/`, `specs/`)
    * Project metadata (e.g., `package.json`)
    * Stakeholder information (if provided)
* **2.2.  AI Provider Integration:** Integrate with multiple AI providers, including but not limited to:
    * Azure OpenAI
    * Google AI
    * GitHub AI
    * Ollama (local LLMs)
    * Allow users to select the preferred provider via CLI or configuration.
* **2.3. PMBOK Document Generation:** Generate a suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant documents, including but not limited to:
    * Project Charter
    * Scope Management Plan
    * Requirements Management Plan
    * Risk Management Plan
    * Cost Management Plan
    * Quality Management Plan
    * Resource Management Plan
    * Communications Management Plan
    * Procurement Management Plan
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary
    * Schedule Network Diagram
    * Stakeholder Register and Stakeholder Engagement Plan
    * User Stories and Requirements
    * User Personas
    * Key Roles and Needs Analysis
    * Technology Stack Analysis
    * Data Model Suggestions
    * Acceptance Criteria
    * Compliance Considerations
    * UI/UX Considerations
    * Project KickOff Preparations Checklist
* **2.4.  Output Formatting:**  Generate output documents in multiple formats (e.g., Markdown, JSON, YAML), as specified by the user.
* **2.5.  Document Validation:** Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7th Edition standards, providing a compliance report including scores and recommendations for improvement.
* **2.6.  Version Control:** Maintain a version history of generated documents using Git, allowing users to view diffs, revert to previous versions, and optionally push changes to a remote repository.
* **2.7.  Error Handling and Reporting:** Provide robust error handling and clear, informative error messages.  Log all errors and warnings to a file.
* **2.8.  Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Provide a user-friendly CLI for easy interaction with the tool, including options for selecting specific documents to generate, specifying output format, and configuring AI provider settings.
* **2.9. Configuration Management:** Allow users to configure settings (e.g., API keys, output directory, AI model selection) via a configuration file (e.g., `.env`) or CLI arguments.
* **2.10. Enhanced Context Management:** Implement a sophisticated context management system that:
    * Prioritizes relevant information from various sources
    * Optimizes context size for different AI models
    * Provides detailed context utilization reports


## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

* **3.1. Performance:** The RGA shall generate documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined based on testing).
* **3.2. Security:** The RGA shall securely handle API keys and other sensitive information.
* **3.3. Scalability:** The RGA shall be able to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities.
* **3.4. Usability:** The RGA shall have a user-friendly CLI and clear documentation.
* **3.5. Reliability:** The RGA shall be reliable and robust, minimizing unexpected errors.
* **3.6. Maintainability:** The RGA shall be designed for ease of maintenance and future enhancements.


## 4. Stakeholder Requirements

* **Project Managers:**  Need accurate, complete, and easily accessible project documentation.
* **Business Analysts:** Need a tool to efficiently gather and document requirements.
* **Developers:**  Need clear specifications and documentation to support development.
* **Compliance Officers:** Need assurance that generated documents comply with PMBOK standards.


## 5. Business Requirements

* Reduce the time and effort required to create project management documentation.
* Improve the accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards.
* Enhance stakeholder communication and alignment.


## 6. Assumptions and Constraints

* The availability and reliability of the chosen AI providers.
* The quality of the input project context.
* The accuracy of the AI models used.
* Resource limitations (time, budget, personnel).


## 7. Requirements Prioritization

Requirements are prioritized based on their impact on project goals and feasibility.  High-priority requirements are those directly related to core functionality and PMBOK compliance (e.g., document generation, validation).  Medium-priority requirements relate to usability and extensibility.


## 8. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

A separate Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, linking requirements to design, development, and test artifacts.  This will ensure that all requirements are addressed and tracked.


## 9. Approval and Sign-Off

| Name             | Role                  | Signature             | Date       |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------|
| [Stakeholder Name]| [Stakeholder Role]     |                       |            |
| [Stakeholder Name]| [Stakeholder Role]     |                       |            |
| [Stakeholder Name]| [Stakeholder Role]     |                       |            |


This document is subject to change as the project evolves.  Any changes will be documented and communicated to relevant stakeholders.
