# Requirements Documentation: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, an AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant project management documentation.  This document adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and serves as a comprehensive guide for developers, stakeholders, and project managers involved in the RGA project.

**2. Functional Requirements**

The RGA shall:

* **2.1. Project Charter Generation:** Generate a complete and accurate PMBOK-compliant project charter based on input data provided via a command-line interface (CLI) or configuration file.  The charter shall include, but not be limited to: project purpose, objectives, stakeholders, high-level requirements, assumptions, constraints, and approvals.
* **2.2. PMBOK Document Generation:** Generate a suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents based on the provided project context. This includes, but is not limited to:
    * Stakeholder Register
    * Scope Management Plan
    * Requirements Management Plan
    * Risk Management Plan
    * Cost Management Plan
    * Quality Management Plan
    * Resource Management Plan
    * Communications Management Plan
    * Procurement Management Plan
    * Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary
    * Schedule Network Diagram and Milestone List
    * Stakeholder Engagement Plan
    * Technology Stack Analysis
    * Data Model Suggestions (where applicable)
    * Acceptance Criteria
    * Compliance Considerations
    * UI/UX Considerations (where applicable)
* **2.3. AI Integration:** Integrate seamlessly with specified AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) using secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., Azure Entra ID, API keys).  The system shall handle authentication errors gracefully and provide informative error messages.
* **2.4. Input Processing:**  Intelligently process various types of input documents, including README.md files, requirements specifications, architecture documents, and stakeholder information documents. The system shall identify and prioritize relevant information based on content analysis and relevance scoring.
* **2.5. Output Management:** Generate output documents in a specified format (Markdown, JSON, YAML).  The output shall be well-structured, organized, and easily accessible.  The system shall include a master index file (README.md) linking all generated documents.
* **2.6. Validation and Quality Assessment:**  Validate generated documents against PMBOK standards and provide a quality assessment score along with actionable recommendations for improvement.  This includes checks for completeness, consistency, and adherence to PMBOK terminology.
* **2.7. Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle failures during AI calls, file processing, and document generation.  Comprehensive logs shall be generated for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
* **2.8. CLI and Configuration:**  Provide a user-friendly CLI with options for specifying input sources, output format, AI provider, and validation options.  The system shall support configuration via environment variables or a configuration file.
* **2.9. Context Management:** Implement an enhanced context manager that optimizes context utilization for different AI models, maximizing the accuracy and completeness of generated documents.
* **2.10.  Retry Logic:** Implement retry mechanisms for failed AI calls to improve reliability and robustness.


**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **3.1. Performance:** The RGA shall generate documents within a reasonable timeframe, considering the size and complexity of the input data and the capabilities of the selected AI provider.  Performance metrics shall be tracked and reported.
* **3.2. Security:** The RGA shall securely handle sensitive data, including API keys and project information.  Appropriate security measures shall be implemented to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
* **3.3. Scalability:** The RGA shall be designed to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities, scaling efficiently as needed.
* **3.4. Usability:** The RGA shall be user-friendly and easy to use, with clear instructions and helpful error messages. The CLI shall be intuitive and well-documented.
* **3.5. Maintainability:** The RGA shall be designed for easy maintenance and updates, with modular code and clear documentation.
* **3.6. Portability:** The RGA shall be compatible with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **3.7. Reliability:** The RGA shall be reliable and consistent in its output, minimizing errors and inconsistencies.


**4. Stakeholder Requirements**

* **Project Managers:** Need efficient generation of accurate and complete PMBOK-compliant documentation, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.
* **Business Analysts:** Require tools to efficiently gather and analyze requirements, ensuring traceability and completeness.
* **Developers:** Need a robust and maintainable system that integrates seamlessly with AI providers and handles various input formats.
* **Compliance Officers:** Require assurance that the generated documentation adheres to PMBOK standards and relevant regulations.


**5. Business Requirements**

* Reduce time spent on project documentation.
* Improve accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* Enhance compliance with PMBOK standards.
* Improve stakeholder communication and alignment.
* Increase overall project efficiency and success rates.


**6. Assumptions and Constraints**

* Availability of sufficient computational resources for AI processing.
* Access to reliable internet connectivity.
* Availability of appropriate API keys for chosen AI providers.
* Adherence to the selected AI provider's terms of service and usage limits.


**7. Requirements Prioritization**

Requirements are prioritized based on their criticality to the core functionality and overall project success. High-priority requirements (e.g., PMBOK document generation, AI integration, error handling) must be addressed first.  Medium-priority requirements (e.g., advanced validation features, specific output formatting) can be addressed iteratively.


**8. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**

An RTM will be created and maintained throughout the project lifecycle, linking requirements to design specifications, test cases, and implemented features.


**9. Approval and Sign-off**


| Name                     | Role                       | Signature                  | Date       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| [Stakeholder Name 1]     | [Stakeholder Role 1]       |                           |            |
| [Stakeholder Name 2]     | [Stakeholder Role 2]       |                           |            |
| [Stakeholder Name 3]     | [Stakeholder Role 3]       |                           |            |


This document will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Changes will be documented and communicated to all relevant stakeholders.
