# Requirements Documentation for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

### 1.1 Purpose
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to develop an AI-driven tool that automates the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. This tool is designed to streamline documentation workflows, ensure compliance with PMBOK standards, and improve accuracy and consistency across project artifacts. The AI-powered solution aligns closely with industry best practices, enabling project managers and business analysts to create comprehensive documentation efficiently.

### 1.2 Scope
The tool will support document generation for all PMBOK process groups, including Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. The system will integrate with multiple AI providers, including Azure OpenAI, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama, ensuring flexibility and scalability. It will also feature enhanced context management capabilities to incorporate relevant project information and ensure the quality of generated outputs.
