# Requirements Documentation for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation using AI-powered tools. This Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool leverages Azure OpenAI and other AI providers to generate comprehensive project documentation, reducing manual effort, ensuring compliance, and improving efficiency. This document outlines the functional, non-functional, stakeholder, and business requirements for the project, as well as assumptions, constraints, prioritization, traceability, and approval protocols.
