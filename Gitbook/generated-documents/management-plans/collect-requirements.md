# Collect Requirements Process

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the process for collecting requirements for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  The process emphasizes leveraging the project's existing documentation, employing intelligent analysis techniques, and incorporating stakeholder feedback to ensure comprehensive and accurate requirements capture.  ADPA's unique capabilities, particularly its Evaluative Contextual Synthesis and Hierarchical Authority Recognition, will be instrumental in streamlining this process.

**2. Goals**

The goals of the requirements collection process are to:

* Identify all functional and non-functional requirements for ADPA.
* Prioritize requirements based on business value and feasibility.
* Document requirements clearly, concisely, and unambiguously.
* Ensure stakeholder buy-in and consensus on the requirements.
* Establish a mechanism for managing changing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

**3. Process Steps**

The requirements collection process will follow these steps:

**3.1 Initial Requirements Gathering from Existing Documentation:**

* **Automated Analysis:**  ADPA will automatically analyze existing project documentation (README.md, architecture documents, design documents, etc.) to identify existing requirements, both explicit and implicit.  The system's intelligent source discovery will identify and score all relevant markdown files (as detailed in the project README).  This automated analysis leverages ADPA's existing capabilities in context discovery and relevance scoring (0-100).
* **Manual Review:** A team of experienced business analysts and project managers will review the results of the automated analysis, validating the identified requirements and ensuring completeness.  This step focuses on validating the accuracy and completeness of the automated analysis, particularly addressing any potential biases or ambiguities identified.  High-value sources identified by ADPA's analysis will be prioritized for review.
* **Categorization:** Requirements will be categorized into functional and non-functional requirements.  This step ensures clear separation of what the system *does* versus how well it *performs*.

**3.2 Stakeholder Interviews and Workshops:**

* **Stakeholder Identification:** A stakeholder register will be created, identifying all individuals and groups impacted by or involved in the ADPA project.  ADPA's existing stakeholder mapping capabilities will be leveraged to ensure comprehensive identification.
* **Interview/Workshop Planning:**  Structured interviews and workshops will be planned, tailored to each stakeholder group's needs and level of technical expertise.
* **Data Collection:** Data will be collected through interviews, workshops, and surveys, focusing on gathering missing requirements and validating the requirements identified in Step 3.1.  This process will actively involve stakeholders to ensure consensus and buy-in.
* **Document Review:**  Stakeholders will be provided with drafts of the requirements document for review and feedback.

**3.3 Requirements Prioritization and Refinement:**

* **Prioritization Matrix:** A prioritization matrix will be used to rank requirements based on factors such as business value, risk, and feasibility.  This ensures the team focuses on the most impactful requirements first.
* **Requirement Refinement:** Based on the prioritization and stakeholder feedback, requirements will be refined to ensure clarity, completeness, and consistency.  This step involves iterative refinement to address any ambiguities or inconsistencies identified.

**3.4 Requirements Documentation:**

* **Requirements Document:** A comprehensive requirements document will be created, including all prioritized requirements, acceptance criteria, and associated rationale.  The document will adhere to a consistent format and style.
* **Version Control:** The requirements document will be maintained using a version control system (Git) to track changes and ensure traceability. ADPA's built-in VCS capabilities will be used to manage the document's version history.

**3.5 Requirements Validation:**

* **Formal Reviews:** The requirements document will undergo formal reviews by stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* **Traceability Matrix:** A traceability matrix will be created to link requirements to design specifications, test cases, and other project artifacts.

**4. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used in the requirements collection process:

* ADPA (for automated analysis, context management, and document generation).
* Stakeholder interview guides and questionnaires.
* Prioritization matrices.
* Requirements management software (e.g., Jira, Confluence).
* Version control system (Git).

**5. Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the requirements collection process.
* **Business Analysts:** Facilitate stakeholder interviews and workshops, document requirements, and create the requirements document.
* **Development Team:** Provide technical input and feasibility assessments.
* **Stakeholders:** Participate in interviews and workshops, review requirements documents, and provide feedback.

**6. Exit Criteria**

The requirements collection process is complete when:

* All necessary requirements have been identified and documented.
* Requirements have been prioritized and refined.
* Stakeholder consensus has been achieved.
* A comprehensive and validated requirements document has been created.


**7. Change Management**

A formal change management process will be implemented to handle any changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  This includes a formal change request process (as demonstrated by ADPAâ€™s ability to recognize CR-2025-001 authority).  Changes will be documented, reviewed, and approved before being incorporated into the requirements document.

**8. Appendix**

This section will include templates for requirements documentation, stakeholder interview guides, and prioritization matrices.  These templates will leverage ADPA's existing professional templates to ensure consistency and quality.

This comprehensive process, leveraging ADPA's advanced AI capabilities, will ensure efficient and effective requirements gathering for the project.
