# Collect Requirements Process  

## Process Overview  

### Purpose and Objectives  
The **Collect Requirements Process** aims to identify, document, and validate stakeholder needs and expectations to establish a comprehensive set of requirements for the project. These requirements serve as the foundation for project planning, execution, and delivery, ensuring alignment with stakeholder goals and PMBOK standards.  

### Scope and Boundaries  
The process is focused on gathering requirements for all project deliverables, including functional, non-functional, technical, and compliance-related requirements. It excludes activities related to scope validation, which are addressed in the **Validate Scope Process**.  

### Integration with Other Project Processes  
The Collect Requirements Process integrates with:  
- **Scope Management**: Ensures alignment between requirements and the defined project scope.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Involves stakeholders throughout the requirements gathering lifecycle.  
- **Risk Management**: Identifies risks related to requirements collection and validation.  
- **Change Management**: Accommodates requirement changes during the project lifecycle.  

### PMBOK Alignment  
- **Process Group**: Planning  
- **Knowledge Area**: Project Scope Management

## Process Outputs  

### Key Outputs  
- **Requirements Documentation**: A detailed list of all collected requirements, including functional, non-functional, and technical requirements.  
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**: A tool to map requirements to project deliverables, ensuring alignment and traceability.  
- **Process Updates**: Refinements to the requirements management plan based on lessons learned and feedback.

## Requirements Collection Activities  

### Stakeholder Identification and Engagement  
- Identify stakeholders using the **Stakeholder Register**.  
- Engage stakeholders based on their roles, influence, and interest levels.  
- Define communication methods to keep stakeholders informed and involved.  

### Requirements Elicitation Sessions  
- Conduct workshops, interviews, focus groups, and surveys to gather requirements.  
- Use facilitation and active listening to ensure accurate capture of stakeholder needs.  

### Requirements Analysis and Validation  
- Analyze and refine requirements to ensure they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.  
- Validate requirements with stakeholders to confirm alignment with project goals.  

### Requirements Documentation and Approval  
- Document requirements using standardized templates.  
- Seek formal approval from stakeholders or project sponsors.

## Quality Considerations  

### Requirements Quality Criteria  
- **Completeness**: All necessary requirements are captured.  
- **Consistency**: Requirements do not conflict with each other.  
- **Traceability**: Requirements are linked to project deliverables and objectives.  
- **Feasibility**: Requirements can be realistically achieved within constraints.  

### Validation and Verification Methods  
- **Peer Reviews**: Review requirements documentation with project team members.  
- **Stakeholder Validation**: Confirm requirements accuracy with stakeholders.  
- **Prototyping**: Validate requirements by demonstrating early models or mock-ups.  

### Review and Approval Processes  
- Establish a formal review and approval workflow for requirements documentation.  
- Ensure all stakeholders sign off on final requirements before proceeding.  

### Continuous Improvement Approaches  
- Capture lessons learned to improve future requirements gathering efforts.  
- Periodically review requirements quality and make refinements as needed.

## Process Metrics  

### Requirements Collection Metrics  
- **Number of Requirements Collected**: Tracks the total requirements identified.  
- **Requirements Coverage**: Measures the percentage of stakeholder needs addressed.  

### Quality Measurements  
- **Accuracy of Requirements**: Assesses completeness and correctness.  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Evaluates stakeholder approval of final requirements.  

### Progress Tracking Methods  
- **Milestone Tracking**: Monitors progress against requirements collection timelines.  
- **Issue Logs**: Tracks and resolves requirements-related issues.  

### Performance Indicators  
- **Requirements Approval Rate**: Measures the percentage of requirements approved on the first submission.  
- **Requirements Change Rate**: Tracks the frequency of requirement changes during execution.

## Risk Management  

### Requirements-Related Risks  
- **Stakeholder Misalignment**: Conflicts in stakeholder expectations and priorities.  
- **Incomplete Requirements**: Missing or unclear requirements impacting deliverables.  
- **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled changes to requirements during the project lifecycle.  

### Risk Mitigation Strategies  
- **Early Stakeholder Engagement**: Involve stakeholders from the beginning to minimize misalignment.  
- **Requirements Validation**: Conduct thorough validation sessions to confirm completeness.  
- **Change Control Processes**: Implement formal processes to manage scope changes.  

### Contingency Planning  
Prepare fallback strategies for requirements-related risks, such as additional elicitation sessions or scope adjustments.  

### Risk Monitoring Procedures  
Regularly review and update the risk register to track requirements-related risks.
