## Validate Scope Process

### Purpose
The **Validate Scope Process** is designed to formally ensure that the deliverables of the Requirements Gathering Agent project meet stakeholder expectations, fulfill project requirements, and align with the agreed-upon scope. It involves stakeholder review, acceptance, and documentation of validation outcomes.

### Inputs
#### 1. **Project Documents**
- **Project Charter**: Defines high-level objectives, scope, and constraints.
- **Scope Management Plan**: Outlines how scope validation will be performed.
- **Requirements Documentation**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix**: Maps requirements to deliverables for traceability.
- **Project Scope Statement**: Defines in-scope and out-of-scope items and deliverables.
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Hierarchical decomposition of deliverables.
- **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed descriptions of work packages.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Predefined criteria for deliverable acceptance.

#### 2. **Project Deliverables**
- Generated PMBOK-Compliant Documents (e.g., Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan).
- Supporting artifacts (e.g., architecture documentation, requirements management plan).

#### 3. **Organizational Assets**
- Document templates.
- Validation checklists.
- Lessons learned from previous projects.

#### 4. **Enterprise Environmental Factors**
- Industry standards (e.g., PMBOK compliance guidelines).
- Stakeholder expectations and preferences.

#### 5. **Expert Judgment**
- Involve project management experts, domain specialists, and compliance officers to ensure deliverables align with PMBOK standards.

#### 6. **Validation Automation**
- Leverage the Requirements Gathering Agent’s built-in validation features:
  - **PMBOK Compliance Validation**: Ensures all required elements are present.
  - **Cross-Document Consistency Checks**: Validates relationships between documents.
  - **Quality Assessment**: Scores documents based on completeness and accuracy.

### Outputs
#### 1. **Accepted Deliverables**
- Deliverables formally approved by stakeholders based on predefined acceptance criteria.

#### 2. **Change Requests**
- Documented requests for modifications if deliverables fail to meet acceptance criteria.

#### 3. **Work Performance Information**
- Validation metrics and feedback (e.g., number of deliverables accepted, rejected, or modified).

#### 4. **Validation Reports**
