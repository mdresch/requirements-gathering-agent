## Requirements Management Plan

**Project:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


### 1. Overview

This Requirements Management Plan (RMP) outlines the processes and procedures for managing requirements throughout the Requirements Gathering Agent project lifecycle.  It ensures that all requirements are clearly defined, documented, analyzed, validated, and traced throughout the project, ultimately contributing to the successful delivery of a high-quality product that meets stakeholder needs and expectations.  This plan aligns with the overall Project Management Plan and integrates seamlessly with scope management processes.


### 2. Requirements Planning

**2.1 Requirements Gathering Approach and Methodology:**  A mixed approach will be employed, leveraging both elicitation techniques and analysis of existing documentation.  This includes:

* **Document Analysis:**  Thorough review of the project README, architecture documentation, and other relevant project documents to capture existing requirements.  This leverages the project's built-in analysis capabilities.
* **Stakeholder Interviews:**  Discussions with key stakeholders (developers, PMO, potential users) to identify and clarify requirements, address ambiguities, and capture missing information.
* **Prototyping:**  Creation of a functional prototype to validate and refine requirements early in the development process.

**2.2 Stakeholder Involvement Strategy:**  Stakeholders will be actively involved throughout the requirements lifecycle.  This will involve:

* **Regular Communication:**  Meetings, email updates, and progress reports will keep stakeholders informed of progress and any changes.
* **Feedback Mechanisms:**  Formal review sessions and informal feedback channels will allow stakeholders to provide input and address concerns.
* **Decision-Making Processes:**  Clearly defined decision-making processes will ensure that stakeholder concerns are addressed efficiently.

**2.3 Requirements Categories and Types:** Requirements will be categorized as follows:

* **Functional Requirements:** What the system *must do*.  Examples include generating specific PMBOK documents, integrating with Azure OpenAI, providing a CLI interface.
* **Non-Functional Requirements:**  Qualities and characteristics of the system, such as performance, security, usability, and maintainability.  Examples include response time, security protocols, ease of use, and code maintainability.
* **Business Requirements:** High-level objectives and goals that the system must achieve. Examples include reducing manual documentation effort, improving documentation quality, and ensuring PMBOK compliance.

**2.4 Requirements Prioritization Criteria:**  Requirements will be prioritized based on:

* **Business Value:**  The contribution of the requirement to overall business goals.
* **Risk:**  The potential impact of not meeting the requirement.
* **Dependencies:**  The relationship of the requirement to other requirements.
* **Effort:**  The resources required to implement the requirement.  MoSCoW method will be utilized (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).


### 3. Requirements Analysis

**3.1 Analysis Techniques and Tools:**  Requirements will be analyzed using:

* **Use Cases:**  Describing how users interact with the system.
* **User Stories:**  Capturing requirements from a user's perspective.
* **Data Flow Diagrams:**  Illustrating the flow of data within the system.
* **UML Diagrams:**  Visual representation of the system architecture.
* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  Tracking the relationship between requirements, design, and testing.

**3.2 Requirements Validation Methods:**  Requirements will be validated through:

* **Reviews:**  Formal reviews by stakeholders to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* **Prototyping:**  Testing the prototype to verify that requirements are met.
* **Walkthroughs:**  Informal reviews to identify potential issues early.

**3.3 Acceptance Criteria Definition:**  Clear and measurable acceptance criteria will be defined for each requirement to ensure that the system meets stakeholder expectations.

**3.4 Requirements Decomposition Approach:**  A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) will be used to decompose high-level requirements into smaller, more manageable tasks.


### 4. Requirements Documentation

**4.1 Documentation Standards and Templates:**  A standardized template will be used for documenting requirements, ensuring consistency and clarity.  This will include:

* **Requirement ID:**  Unique identifier for each requirement.
* **Description:**  Clear and concise statement of the requirement.
* **Priority:**  Priority level (high, medium, low).
* **Source:**  Origin of the requirement (stakeholder, document).
* **Status:**  Current status of the requirement (e.g., proposed, approved, implemented).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Conditions that must be met for the requirement to be considered complete.
* **Rationale:**  Explanation of why the requirement is necessary.

**4.2 Requirements Attributes and Metadata:**  Additional attributes may be added as needed, such as dependencies, risks, and assumptions.

**4.3 Traceability Requirements:**  A traceability matrix will be used to track the relationship between requirements, design, code, and test cases.

**4.4 Version Control and Configuration Management:**  A version control system (e.g., Git) will be used to manage changes to requirements documentation.


### 5. Requirements Communication

**5.1 Stakeholder Communication Plan:**  A communication plan will be developed to ensure that stakeholders are kept informed of requirements-related activities.

**5.2 Requirements Review and Approval Process:**  A formal review process will be established for reviewing and approving requirements.

**5.3 Change Communication Procedures:**  A process will be defined for communicating changes to requirements to stakeholders.

**5.4 Status Reporting and Metrics:**  Regular status reports will be provided to stakeholders, including metrics such as the number of requirements completed, outstanding requirements, and open change requests.


### 6. Requirements Change Management

**6.1 Change Request Process:**  A formal process will be used for submitting, reviewing, and approving change requests.

**6.2 Impact Analysis Procedures:**  An impact analysis will be conducted for each change request to assess its potential impact on other requirements, the schedule, and the budget.

**6.3 Change Approval Authority:**  The change approval authority will be clearly defined.

**6.4 Change Implementation Procedures:**  A process will be defined for implementing approved changes to requirements.


### 7. Requirements Verification and Validation

**7.1 Verification Methods and Criteria:**  Requirements will be verified to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and unambiguous.  This will involve reviews and walkthroughs.

**7.2 Validation Approach and Schedule:**  Requirements will be validated to ensure that they meet stakeholder needs and expectations.  This will involve prototyping and testing.

**7.3 Acceptance Testing Strategy:**  An acceptance testing strategy will be defined to ensure that the system meets the acceptance criteria.

**7.4 Quality Assurance Procedures:**  Quality assurance procedures will be implemented to ensure that the requirements are of high quality.


### 8. Requirements Traceability

**8.1 Traceability Matrix Development:**  A traceability matrix will be developed to track the relationship between requirements, design, code, and test cases.

**8.2 Traceability Maintenance Procedures:**  Procedures will be defined for maintaining the traceability matrix throughout the project lifecycle.

**8.3 Relationship Mapping Requirements:**  Requirements will be mapped to each other to identify dependencies and relationships.

**8.4 Coverage Analysis Methods:**  Methods will be used to analyze the completeness of requirements coverage.


### 9. Tools and Techniques

* **Requirements Management Tool:**  A dedicated requirements management tool (e.g., Jira, Confluence) may be used, or the project's own documentation system could suffice.
* **Analysis and Modeling Techniques:**  Use cases, user stories, data flow diagrams, UML diagrams.
* **Documentation and Collaboration Tools:**  Confluence, Google Docs, Microsoft Teams.
* **Metrics and Measurement Tools:**  Spreadsheets, project management software.
