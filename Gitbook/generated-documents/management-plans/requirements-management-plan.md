# Requirements Management Plan  

## Overview  

### Purpose and Scope  
The **Requirements Management Plan** outlines the processes, tools, and techniques that will be used to manage requirements throughout the lifecycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan ensures that all project requirements are correctly identified, analyzed, documented, communicated, and controlled to meet stakeholder needs and project objectives.  

### Alignment with Project Management Plan  
This plan aligns with the overall **Project Management Plan**, ensuring integration with related processes such as scope management, schedule management, and stakeholder engagement. It adheres to PMBOK guidelines and supports compliance with industry standards.  

### Integration with Scope Management Processes  
Requirements management is tightly integrated with the **Scope Management Plan**, ensuring that all requirements are captured, validated, and controlled to prevent scope creep and maintain project alignment.

## Requirements Planning  

### Requirements Gathering Approach and Methodology  
The project will use a combination of workshops, interviews, surveys, document analysis, and brainstorming sessions to gather requirements from stakeholders. Agile approaches will be leveraged for iterative refinement of requirements.  

### Stakeholder Involvement Strategy  
Stakeholders such as project managers, business analysts, developers, compliance officers, and end-users will be engaged through structured workshops, regular communication, and approval checkpoints. Their roles and responsibilities will be clearly defined in the **Stakeholder Register**.  

### Requirements Categories and Types  
Requirements will be categorized as:  
- **Functional Requirements**: Describing system behavior and capabilities.  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Addressing system performance, scalability, security, and compliance.  
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific technology-related needs.  
- **Business Requirements**: Aligning with organizational goals.  

### Requirements Prioritization Criteria  
Requirements will be prioritized based on:  
- **Business Value**  
- **Stakeholder Urgency**  
- **Technical Feasibility**  
- **Regulatory Compliance**  

---

## Requirements Analysis  

### Analysis Techniques and Tools  
The project will use techniques such as:  
- **Context Analysis**: Using the Enhanced Context Manager.  
- **Requirements Decomposition**: Breaking down high-level requirements into detailed actionable items.  
- **Modeling Tools**: Use case diagrams, flowcharts, and wireframes.  

### Requirements Validation Methods  
Validation methods include:  
- Stakeholder reviews and walkthroughs.  
- Cross-document consistency checks.  
- Testing against acceptance criteria.  

### Acceptance Criteria Definition  
Acceptance criteria will be defined for each requirement to ensure clarity and alignment with stakeholder expectations. These criteria will be documented and validated before implementation.  

### Requirements Decomposition Approach  
High-level project requirements will be decomposed into detailed functional, non-functional, and technical requirements using a hierarchical structure such as the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.  

---

## Requirements Documentation  

### Documentation Standards and Templates  
Requirements will be documented using PMBOK-compliant templates, ensuring consistency and completeness. Each requirement will include:  
- Unique ID  
- Description  
- Category  
- Priority  
- Acceptance Criteria  
- Status  

### Requirements Attributes and Metadata  
Requirements will include attributes such as:  
- **Source** (e.g., stakeholder, regulation, business case).  
- **Priority** (low, medium, high).  
- **Version** (for change tracking).  

### Traceability Requirements  
All requirements will include traceability metadata to link them to project objectives, deliverables, test cases, and stakeholder needs.  

### Version Control and Configuration Management  
Version control will be managed using Git repositories, ensuring that changes to requirements are tracked, reviewed, and approved before implementation.  

---

## Requirements Communication  

### Stakeholder Communication Plan  
Stakeholders will be updated regularly through:  
- **Weekly Status Reports**  
- **Requirements Review Workshops**  
- **Change Request Updates**  

### Requirements Review and Approval Process  
Requirements will be reviewed and approved based on formal stakeholder sign-off. Approval checkpoints will be established for critical requirements milestones.  

### Change Communication Procedures  
Changes to requirements will be communicated through structured updates, ensuring all affected stakeholders are informed of impacts on scope, schedule, and cost.  

### Status Reporting and Metrics  
Requirements status will be reported using metrics such as:  
- **Completion Percentage**  
- **Pending Approvals**  
- **Change Requests**  

---

## Requirements Change Management  

### Change Request Process  
Change requests will be submitted through a formal process that includes:  
1. Submission of a **Change Request Form**.  
2. Impact analysis by the project team.  
3. Stakeholder review and approval.  
4. Implementation planning and execution.  

### Impact Analysis Procedures  
Impact analysis will evaluate how changes affect:  
- Project scope.  
- Schedule and costs.  
- Related requirements and deliverables.  

### Change Approval Authority  
The **Change Control Board (CCB)** will have authority over requirements changes, ensuring alignment with project objectives and stakeholder priorities.  

### Change Implementation Procedures  
Approved changes will be incorporated into project plans and communicated to all relevant stakeholders. Implementation will follow established workflows.  

---

## Requirements Verification and Validation  

### Verification Methods and Criteria  
Verification will ensure that requirements are correctly implemented through:  
- Peer reviews of documentation.  
- Automated validation tools.  
- Compliance checks against PMBOK standards.  

### Validation Approach and Schedule  
Validation will be conducted at regular intervals during development, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and acceptance criteria.  

### Acceptance Testing Strategy  
Acceptance testing will confirm that all requirements are fully met before deliverable handover. Test cases will be mapped directly to requirements.  

### Quality Assurance Procedures  
Quality assurance will include:  
- Document audits.  
- Testing validation reports.  
- Stakeholder feedback loops.  

---

## Requirements Traceability  

### Traceability Matrix Development  
A **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)** will be developed to map requirements to:  
- Project objectives.  
- Deliverables.  
- Test cases.  

### Traceability Maintenance Procedures  
The RTM will be updated regularly to reflect changes and ensure alignment with project progress.  

### Relationship Mapping Requirements
