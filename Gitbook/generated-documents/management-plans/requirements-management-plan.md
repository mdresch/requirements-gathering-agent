# Requirements Management Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements management plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This plan details the processes, tools, and responsibilities involved in managing requirements throughout the project lifecycle.  The project aims to deliver a revolutionary enterprise business analysis automation platform, generating BABOK v3 compliant frameworks and other documentation in seconds.  This necessitates a robust requirements management process to ensure the final product meets the stringent needs of Fortune 500 clients and adheres to industry best practices.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

The primary goals of the requirements management process are to:

* Clearly define and document all project requirements.
* Ensure stakeholder agreement on requirements.
* Trace requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
* Manage changes to requirements effectively.
* Verify that the final product meets the defined requirements.

**3. Stakeholder Identification and Roles**

The following stakeholders will be involved in the requirements management process:

* **Project Sponsor:** Provides overall direction and approves significant changes.
* **Product Owner:** Defines the product vision and prioritizes requirements.
* **Business Analysts:** Elicit, analyze, and document requirements.
* **Development Team:** Designs, develops, and tests the system.
* **Testing Team:** Verifies and validates the system against requirements.
* **End-Users (Fortune 500 Clients):** Provide feedback and validation on the system.

**Roles and Responsibilities:**  A detailed RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) will be created and maintained, outlining specific responsibilities for each stakeholder.

**4. Requirements Elicitation Techniques**

The following techniques will be used to elicit requirements:

* **Interviews:** Conduct structured interviews with key stakeholders.
* **Surveys:** Gather information from a wider range of stakeholders.
* **Document Analysis:** Review existing documentation to identify requirements.
* **Observation:** Observe stakeholders in their work environment to understand their needs.
* **Prototyping:** Develop prototypes to gather feedback on requirements.
* **API-First Design:** Using TypeSpec for comprehensive specification and validation.

**5. Requirements Documentation**

Requirements will be documented using the following methods:

* **User Stories:**  Used to capture functional requirements from the end-user perspective.
* **Use Cases:** Describe the interactions between the user and the system.
* **Requirement Specification Document:** A comprehensive document outlining all functional and non-functional requirements.  This will include detailed descriptions, acceptance criteria, and traceability information.
* **Data Dictionary:** Define all data elements used in the system.
* **TypeSpec:** OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for the API, serving as the primary source of truth for API requirements.

**6. Requirements Management Tools**

The following tools will be utilized:

* **TypeSpec:** For API specification and validation.
* **Confluence/SharePoint:** For centralized requirements documentation and collaboration.  (Specific platform choice will be determined based on client preference and existing infrastructure).
* **Jira/Azure DevOps:** For issue tracking and change management. (Specific platform choice will be determined based on existing development workflow).

**7. Requirements Traceability**

A traceability matrix will be maintained to track the relationships between requirements, design, code, and test cases.  This ensures that all requirements are addressed and that changes are properly managed.

**8. Requirements Change Management**

A formal change management process will be implemented to manage changes to requirements:

* **Change Request Form:** All change requests must be submitted using a formal change request form.
* **Change Control Board:**  A Change Control Board (CCB) will review and approve all change requests.
* **Impact Assessment:**  The impact of any change request on the project schedule, budget, and scope will be assessed.

**9. Requirements Verification and Validation**

Requirements will be verified and validated throughout the project lifecycle:

* **Reviews:**  Regular reviews of requirements documentation will be conducted to ensure accuracy and completeness.
* **Testing:**  The system will be thoroughly tested to ensure that it meets the defined requirements.  This will include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).

**10. Requirements Baseline**

A baseline will be established for the requirements after stakeholder sign-off.  Any changes to the baseline will be formally managed through the change control process.

**11. Metrics and Reporting**

The following metrics will be tracked and reported:

* Number of requirements.
* Number of change requests.
* Time taken to process change requests.
* Number of defects found during testing.


**12. Plan Maintenance**

This Requirements Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in the project scope or requirements.


This comprehensive plan ensures a robust and controlled approach to managing requirements, minimizing risks, and maximizing the chances of delivering a successful and high-quality product.  The plan will be further detailed with a RACI matrix and specific timelines in subsequent documentation.
