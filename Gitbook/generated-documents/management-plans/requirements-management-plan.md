# Requirements Management Plan

## Overview

### Purpose and Scope of Requirements Management  
The purpose of this Requirements Management Plan is to establish a structured approach for gathering, analyzing, documenting, communicating, and managing requirements throughout the lifecycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan ensures alignment with PMBOK standards and the project management plan, enabling the delivery of a solution that meets stakeholder expectations while adhering to project constraints.

### Alignment with Project Management Plan  
This plan directly supports the project management plan by integrating with the scope management processes, ensuring traceability of requirements to project deliverables, and facilitating effective communication with stakeholders.

### Integration with Scope Management Processes  
Requirements management is closely integrated with scope management to ensure that all requirements are clearly defined, validated, and controlled. The outputs of this plan will feed into the development of the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), scope baseline, and other planning artifacts.

## Requirements Planning

### Requirements Gathering Approach and Methodology  
- Conduct detailed workshops, interviews, and surveys with stakeholders.  
- Perform document analysis of existing project artifacts (e.g., README.md, architecture documents, stakeholders.md).  
- Utilize AI-powered analysis tools to identify relevant requirements from project documentation.  
- Apply iterative and collaborative techniques to refine requirements.

### Stakeholder Involvement Strategy  
- Identify key stakeholders using the stakeholder register.  
- Engage stakeholders in requirements elicitation activities, including workshops and review sessions.  
- Maintain regular communication to ensure alignment and address evolving needs.

### Requirements Categories and Types  
- **Functional Requirements**: Capabilities the system must provide (e.g., CLI functionality, PMBOK document generation).  
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: System constraints such as performance, security, and scalability.  
- **Technical Requirements**: Integration needs with AI providers and modular architecture.  
- **Compliance Requirements**: Adherence to PMBOK standards and organizational policies.

### Requirements Prioritization Criteria  
- **Business Value**: Impact on project goals and objectives.  
- **Feasibility**: Technical and operational feasibility.  
- **Stakeholder Importance**: Alignment with stakeholder priorities.  
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to industry standards and PMBOK guidelines.

## Requirements Analysis

### Analysis Techniques and Tools  
- Use AI-powered tools for document analysis and context building.  
- Perform gap analysis to ensure completeness of requirements.  
- Apply modeling techniques such as use case diagrams and process flows for better visualization.

### Requirements Validation Methods  
- Conduct stakeholder validation sessions to ensure accuracy and completeness.  
- Verify requirements against PMBOK standards and organizational goals.  
- Use automated schema validation tools for technical requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria Definition  
- Define clear and measurable criteria for each requirement (e.g., "CLI must generate PMBOK-compliant documents in JSON format").  
- Align acceptance criteria with stakeholder needs, project charter, and compliance standards.

### Requirements Decomposition Approach  
- Decompose high-level requirements into actionable components using a hierarchical approach.  
- Map requirements to project deliverables, work packages, and activities.

---

## Requirements Documentation

### Documentation Standards and Templates  
- Use standardized templates aligned with PMBOK guidelines for requirements documentation.  
- Ensure consistent structure and terminology across all documents.

### Requirements Attributes and Metadata  
Each requirement will include the following attributes:  
- **ID**: Unique identifier.  
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the requirement.  
- **Priority**: High, medium, or low.  
- **Category**: Functional, non-functional, technical, or compliance.  
- **Status**: Proposed, approved, or implemented.

### Traceability Requirements  
- Ensure traceability from requirements to project scope, deliverables, and test cases.  
- Maintain a requirements traceability matrix.

### Version Control and Configuration Management  
- Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes to requirements documentation.  
- Implement configuration management to track document updates and ensure consistency.

---

## Requirements Communication

### Stakeholder Communication Plan  
- Conduct regular meetings and workshops to review and update requirements.  
- Provide stakeholders with access to requirements documentation via shared repositories.

### Requirements Review and Approval Process  
- Establish formal review sessions to validate and approve requirements.  
- Require sign-off from key stakeholders before implementation.

### Change Communication Procedures  
- Communicate requirement changes to all affected stakeholders promptly.  
- Use structured communication channels to ensure clarity and accessibility.

### Status Reporting and Metrics  
- Provide periodic updates on requirements status via progress reports.  
- Track metrics such as percentage of requirements validated and implemented.

---

## Requirements Change Management

### Change Request Process  
- Document all change requests using a formal template.  
- Log change requests in a centralized repository for tracking.

### Impact Analysis Procedures  
- Assess the impact of requirement changes on project scope, schedule, cost, and risks.  
- Use AI-powered tools to evaluate dependencies and relationships.

### Change Approval Authority  
- Define a change control board (CCB) comprising project managers, stakeholders, and technical leads.  
- Require CCB approval for all changes.

### Change Implementation Procedures  
- Update requirements documentation and traceability matrix.  
- Communicate changes to the development team and other stakeholders.

---

## Requirements Verification and Validation

### Verification Methods and Criteria  
- Use checklist-based verification to ensure requirements are met.  
- Compare deliverables against documented acceptance criteria.

### Validation Approach and Schedule  
- Schedule validation sessions with stakeholders at key milestones.  
- Perform testing to confirm requirements compliance and functionality.

### Acceptance Testing Strategy  
- Develop test cases aligned with requirements and acceptance criteria.  
- Use automated testing tools to validate outputs where feasible.

### Quality Assurance Procedures  
- Incorporate requirements quality checks into QA processes.  
- Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards and organizational policies.

---

## Requirements Traceability

### Traceability Matrix Development  
- Develop a traceability matrix to map requirements to project deliverables, activities, and test cases.  
- Include columns for requirement ID, description, source, and related deliverables.

### Traceability Maintenance Procedures  
- Update the traceability matrix as requirements evolve.  
- Ensure traceability is maintained throughout the project lifecycle.

### Relationship Mapping Requirements  
- Map relationships between requirements to identify dependencies and conflicts.  
- Use visualization tools to represent relationships graphically.

### Coverage Analysis Methods  
- Perform periodic reviews to ensure all requirements are addressed in the project scope and deliverables.

---

## Tools and Techniques

### Requirements Management Tools  
- Use tools such as JIRA, Trello, or Azure DevOps for requirements tracking.  

### Analysis and Modeling Techniques  
- Apply use case modeling, process diagrams, and flowcharts for analysis.  

### Documentation and Collaboration Tools  
- Leverage tools like Confluence, GitBook, and Markdown for documentation.  
- Use collaboration platforms such as Microsoft Teams or Slack for communication.  

### Metrics and Measurement Tools  
- Use dashboards to track requirements metrics (e.g., validation rate, change frequency).
