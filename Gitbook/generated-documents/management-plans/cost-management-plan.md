## Cost Management Plan

**1. Introduction**

This Cost Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for planning, estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, controlling, and closing the costs of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  It adheres to the PMBOK Guide principles for cost management.

**2. Planning Cost Management**

* **2.1. Cost Estimating:** We will utilize a combination of bottom-up and analogous estimating techniques.  Bottom-up estimating will involve breaking down the project into smaller, manageable work packages and estimating the cost of each. Analogous estimating will leverage cost data from similar past projects to provide a high-level estimate.  Specific techniques include:
    * **Expert Judgment:** Consulting with developers experienced in similar projects to refine estimates.
    * **Parametric Estimating:** Using statistical relationships between project parameters (e.g., lines of code, functionality) and cost.
    * **Three-Point Estimating:**  Using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely cost estimates to account for uncertainty.
* **2.2. Cost Budgeting:**  The cost estimates will be aggregated into a detailed budget, categorized by work package and cost account.  The budget will include:
    * **Direct Costs:**  Salaries (development team, PM), software licenses (Azure OpenAI, other AI providers if applicable), cloud computing resources (Azure), any third-party tools or services.
    * **Indirect Costs:**  Project management overhead, administrative costs, office space (if applicable).
    * **Contingency Reserve:** A buffer to account for unforeseen costs and risks (estimated at 10-15% of the total budget).
    * **Management Reserve:** A reserve controlled by senior management to address significant, unforeseen changes to the project (estimated at 5% of the total budget).
* **2.3. Cost Control:**  Regular monitoring and control of project costs will be implemented through:
    * **Earned Value Management (EVM):**  Tracking planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual cost (AC) to identify variances and potential cost overruns.
    * **Performance Reporting:**  Regular reports will be generated to compare actual costs against the budget and identify any significant deviations.
    * **Change Control:**  A formal change control process will be established to manage and approve any changes that may impact the project cost.
* **2.4. Funding Requirements:**  A detailed funding schedule will be developed, outlining the timing and amounts of funding required throughout the project lifecycle.  This will align with the project schedule and the disbursement of funds from relevant sources.

**3. Estimating Costs**

This section details preliminary cost estimations (USD).  These are subject to change based on further analysis and refinement.

| Cost Category        | Description                                         | Estimated Cost |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Direct Costs**     |                                                     |                 |
| Developer Salaries   | Salaries for developers (estimated 2 developers for 3 months) | $60,000         |
| PM Salary            | Project Manager salary (3 months)                     | $15,000         |
| Azure OpenAI Costs   | API calls and usage fees                            | $5,000          |
| Other Software Licenses | Other potential AI provider costs                   | $1,000          |
| Cloud Computing      | Azure resources (compute, storage)                  | $1,000          |
| **Indirect Costs**   |                                                     |                 |
| Project Management   | Overhead for project management                      | $2,000          |
| Administrative Costs | General administrative expenses                       | $1,000          |
| **Contingency Reserve** | Unforeseen costs and risks (15%)                     | $11,400         |
| **Management Reserve** | Significant unforeseen changes (5%)                   | $3,800          |
| **Total Estimated Cost** |                                                     | **$100,000**     |


**4. Cost Baseline**

The cost baseline will be the approved budget, which is the sum of the estimated costs, contingency reserve, and management reserve. This baseline will be used as a benchmark for measuring project performance.

**5. Control Costs**

* **5.1. Performance Measurement:** EVM will be employed to monitor cost performance.  Variance analysis will highlight cost overruns or underruns.
* **5.2. Cost Control Tools:**  Spreadsheets, project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana) will track actual costs against the approved budget.
* **5.3. Corrective Actions:**  If variances exceed predefined thresholds, corrective actions will be implemented to bring the project back on track. This might involve scope changes, resource adjustments, or renegotiating contracts.
* **5.4. Reporting:**  Regular cost reports will be generated and presented to stakeholders, highlighting performance against the cost baseline.

**6. Cost Control Thresholds**

* **Cost Variance (CV):**  A CV exceeding +/- 10% will trigger a review and corrective action.
* **Schedule Variance (SV):**  Significant schedule slippage may indirectly impact costs and will be monitored closely.

**7. Reporting**

Cost reports will be issued weekly and monthly, including:

* Actual vs. Planned Costs
* Cost Variance (CV) and Schedule Variance (SV)
* Earned Value (EV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI)
* Burn-down charts showing remaining budget


**8. Change Control**

All changes to the project scope that impact cost will be managed through a formal change control process. This
