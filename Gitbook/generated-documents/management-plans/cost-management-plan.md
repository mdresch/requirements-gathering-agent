# Cost Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. **Introduction and Purpose**  

The Cost Management Plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent project defines the framework for planning, estimating, budgeting, managing, and controlling project costs to ensure the project is completed within the approved budget. This plan aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition standards and supports the project's objectives to deliver an AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator.  

The purpose of this plan is to:  
- Outline the processes and controls for managing project costs.  
- Provide guidance for cost estimation, tracking, and reporting.  
- Ensure cost-related decisions are made transparently and consistently.  
- Enable proactive identification and resolution of cost variances.  

---

## 2. **Units of Measure**  

Costs will be tracked and reported using the following units of measure:  
- **Currency**: United States Dollars (USD) for all financial transactions.  
- **Effort**: Staff hours for labor costs.  
- **Deliverables**: Number of completed PMBOK-compliant documents or features.  
- **Infrastructure Usage**: Resource consumption metrics for Azure OpenAI APIs (e.g., token usage).  

---

## 3. **Level of Precision and Accuracy**  

- **Precision**: Cost estimates will be rounded to the nearest whole dollar for financial reporting and to the nearest hour for effort reporting.  
- **Accuracy**: Cost estimates will have a tolerance of ±10% for initial planning phases and ±5% for execution and monitoring phases.  

---

## 4. **Organizational Procedures Links**  

Cost management will adhere to organizational procedures and policies, including:  
- **Procurement Guidelines**: Vendor and contract management procedures.  
- **Financial Reporting Standards**: Monthly budget reporting templates and frequency.  
- **Resource Allocation Policies**: Guidelines for staff-hour allocation and approval.  
- **Compliance Standards**: Adherence to PMBOK and industry best practices for financial governance.  

---

## 5. **Control Thresholds**  

Cost control thresholds are established to monitor variances against the approved budget:  
- **Minor Variance**: Variance within ±5% of the planned budget requires monitoring but no corrective action.  
- **Major Variance**: Variance exceeding ±10% requires immediate corrective measures and escalation to the project sponsor.  

---

## 6. **Rules of Performance Measurement**  

Earned Value Management (EVM) will be used to track project performance and progress:  
- **Planned Value (PV)**: Budgeted cost of work scheduled.  
- **Earned Value (EV)**: Budgeted cost of work performed.  
- **Actual Cost (AC)**: Actual cost incurred for work performed.  
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI)**: EV ÷ AC, indicating cost efficiency.  
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI)**: EV ÷ PV, indicating schedule efficiency.  

---

## 7. **Reporting Formats**  

Cost reporting will follow a structured format to ensure clarity and consistency:  
- **Weekly Cost Summary**:  
  - Breakdown of actual costs (labor, infrastructure, tools).  
  - Comparison with planned budget.  
  - Identification of variances and corrective actions.  

- **Monthly Financial Report**:  
  - Total expenditures to date.  
  - Forecasted costs for remaining work.  
  - Risks and opportunities impacting budget performance.  

Reports will be shared in PDF format via email and stored in the project documentation repository.

## 8. **Process Descriptions**  

### 8.1 **Cost Estimation**  
Cost estimation will involve:  
- **Bottom-Up Estimation**: Estimating costs by aggregating individual components (e.g., staff hours, infrastructure costs).  
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Reviewing costs from similar projects to refine estimates.  
- **Expert Judgment**: Consulting subject matter experts to validate assumptions.  
- **Vendor Quotes**: Obtaining pricing from Azure OpenAI and other providers for infrastructure costs.  

### 8.2 **Cost Budgeting**  
The total project budget will be developed by aggregating cost estimates and including contingency reserves for risks.  

### 8.3 **Cost Tracking and Control**  
Costs will be tracked using:  
- **Project Management Software**: Tools like Jira for effort tracking and Azure billing dashboards for infrastructure costs.  
- **Variance Analysis**: Regular comparison of actual costs against planned budget.  
- **Corrective Actions**: Adjustments to resource allocation or scope based on cost performance.  

---

## 9. **Funding Requirements**  

Funding will be allocated as follows:  
- **Initial Budget**: $50,000 for development and implementation phases.  
- **Contingency Reserve**: 10% of the total budget for unforeseen expenses.  
- **Payment Schedule**:  
  - 50% upfront for infrastructure and tool setup.  
  - 30% after milestone completion (e.g., CLI development).  
  - 20% upon project delivery and acceptance.  

---

## 10. **Cost Change Control Process**  

Any changes to the project budget must follow the formal change control process:  
1. **Change Request Submission**: Request submitted to the Change Control Board (CCB) with detailed justification and impact analysis.  
2. **Review and Approval**: CCB reviews the request, evaluates its impact on the scope, schedule, and costs, and approves or rejects the change.  
3. **Budget Update**: Update the budget and cost baselines after approval.  
4. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of the approved changes, including revised financial reports.  

---

## 11. **Cost Estimation Methods and Approach**  

The project will use the following cost estimation methods:  
- **Parametric Estimation**: Using cost-per-unit metrics (e.g., $0.02 per token for Azure OpenAI usage).  
- **Analogous Estimation**: Comparing costs with historical data from similar projects.  
- **Three-Point Estimation**: Using optimistic, pessimistic, and most likely cost scenarios to improve accuracy.  
- **Reserve Analysis**: Identifying contingency reserves for risks such as increased API usage or tool upgrades.  

---

## 12. **Cost Tracking Approach**  

Cost tracking will be performed continuously to ensure alignment with the budget:  
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use Azure billing dashboards to track API usage costs.  
2. **Effort Tracking**: Record staff hours in Jira and compare them against estimates.  
3. **Variance Analysis**: Calculate cost and schedule variances using EVM.  
4. **Monthly Reviews**: Conduct monthly budget reviews with project stakeholders.  
5. **Risk Adjustments**: Update cost forecasts based on identified risks and opportunities.

## 13. **Tools and Resources for Cost Management**  

- **Jira**: Effort tracking and resource allocation.  
- **Azure OpenAI Billing Dashboard**: Infrastructure cost monitoring.  
- **Google Sheets**: Budget summaries and variance analysis.  
- **PMBOK Templates**: Cost management templates for consistent reporting.
