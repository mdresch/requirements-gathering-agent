# Cost Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  
## Version: 1.0  
## Date: [Insert Date]  
## Prepared by: [Project Manager Name]

## 1. Introduction  
The purpose of this Cost Management Plan is to define how project costs will be planned, structured, and controlled for the Requirements Gathering Agent project. This plan serves as a guide for estimating, budgeting, financing, funding, managing, and controlling project costs to ensure the project is completed within the approved budget.

---

## 2. Cost Management Approach  
Cost management will follow PMBOK best practices, utilizing a combination of bottom-up estimating and parametric techniques to develop the budget. Cost control will be implemented through regular monitoring and variance analysis to ensure alignment with the baseline budget. The project management information system (PMIS) will be used to track costs and generate reports.

## 3. Cost Estimating  
### 3.1 Estimation Techniques  
- **Bottom-Up Estimating:** Detailed cost estimates will be developed by decomposing work packages into activities and estimating costs for labor, materials, equipment, and other resources.  
- **Parametric Estimating:** Where applicable, parametric models (e.g., cost per line of code, cost per AI API call) will be used to estimate costs based on historical data or industry benchmarks.  

### 3.2 Cost Categories  
- Labor costs (internal project team, contractors)  
- AI service usage fees (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama)  
- Software licenses and tools  
- Infrastructure and hosting  
- Training and knowledge transfer  
- Contingency reserves  
- Miscellaneous expenses (travel, meetings, office supplies)  

### 3.3 Assumptions and Constraints  
- AI provider pricing is based on current published rates and is subject to change.  
- Labor rates assume standard organizational salary and contractor rates.  
- Exchange rate fluctuations may impact costs for international resources or services.  
- Contingency reserves will be set at 10% of the total estimated direct costs.  

---

## 4. Budget Determination  
### 4.1 Budget Aggregation  
Costs will be aggregated at the work package level and then rolled up to the project level to establish the overall project budget baseline.

### 4.2 Contingency and Management Reserves  
- **Contingency Reserves:** For identified risks, allocated at 10% of direct costs.  
- **Management Reserves:** Held by project sponsor for unknown risks, not included in cost baseline but tracked separately.  

### 4.3 Funding Requirements  
Funding will be requested in phases aligned with project milestones and deliverables. Detailed forecasts will be provided to the finance department monthly.

---

## 5. Cost Control  
### 5.1 Monitoring and Reporting  
- Cost performance will be monitored using Earned Value Management (EVM) metrics: Cost Performance Index (CPI), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and Cost Variance (CV).  
- Regular cost reports will be generated and reviewed at weekly status meetings.  
- Any cost overruns or deviations greater than 5% of the baseline must be escalated to the project sponsor immediately.  

### 5.2 Change Control  
- All changes impacting cost estimates or the budget must go through the formal Change Control Board (CCB) process.  
- Approved changes will lead to updates in the cost baseline, with communication to all stakeholders.  

### 5.3 Tools and Techniques  
- Project Management Software (e.g., MS Project, Jira) for tracking costs.  
- AI provider dashboards and billing portals for real-time cost monitoring.  
- Spreadsheet tools for detailed cost analysis and forecasting.
