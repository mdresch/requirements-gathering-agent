# Cost Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the cost management plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  It details the processes, procedures, and controls necessary to ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget. This plan adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.

**2. Purpose**

The purpose of this plan is to provide a framework for:

* Estimating the costs of the project.
* Budgeting the project costs.
* Controlling the project costs.
* Reporting on the project costs.

**3. Units of Measure**

Costs will be measured in US Dollars (USD).  Effort will be tracked in staff hours.  Specific cost categories and their respective units are outlined in Section 6.

**4. Level of Precision and Accuracy**

The level of precision for cost estimates will vary depending on the stage of the project.  Initial estimates will be at a high level (order of magnitude), with increasing precision as the project progresses and more detailed information becomes available.  We aim for ±10% accuracy for the final budget.

**5. Organizational Procedures Links**

* **Timesheet Submission:**  All staff hours will be tracked using the company's standard timesheet system (link to internal documentation).
* **Expense Reimbursement:** All project-related expenses will be submitted through the company's expense reimbursement system (link to internal documentation).
* **Contract Management:** All vendor contracts will adhere to the company's standard contract management procedures (link to internal documentation).


**6. Cost Baseline**

The following cost categories will be used:

| Cost Category             | Unit of Measure | Estimated Cost (USD) | Notes                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Personnel Costs**       | Staff Hours      | $100,000              | Includes salaries, benefits, and overhead for developers, PM, testers.     |
| **Cloud Services (Azure)**| Monthly Fee      | $5,000                | Azure OpenAI, storage, and other cloud-related services.                   |
| **Software Licenses**     | Per License      | $1,000                | Any necessary software licenses (testing tools, etc.).                      |
| **Third-Party Services**  | Per Service      | $2,000                |  Potential costs for external consultants or specialized services.          |
| **Contingency Reserve**   | USD              | $10,000               | Buffer for unforeseen expenses.                                            |
| **Total Estimated Cost**  | USD              | $118,000              |                                                                             |


**7. Control Thresholds**

A cost variance of more than ±5% from the planned budget will trigger a review and potential corrective actions.

**8. Rules of Performance Measurement (Earned Value Management)**

Earned Value Management (EVM) will be used to track project performance.  This will include:

* **Planned Value (PV):** The authorized budget assigned to scheduled work.
* **Earned Value (EV):** The value of the work performed.
* **Actual Cost (AC):** The actual cost incurred.
* **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - PV
* **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC
* **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV / PV
* **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV / AC

These metrics will be monitored regularly and reported as outlined in Section 9.

**9. Reporting Formats**

Cost reports will be generated weekly, using a standard template (example provided in Appendix A).  The reports will include:

* Actual costs incurred.
* Planned costs.
* Earned value.
* Cost variance.
* Cost performance index (CPI).
* Schedule variance.
* Schedule performance index (SPI).
* Burn-down chart.
* Key risks and issues affecting cost.

**10. Process Descriptions**

* **Cost Estimation:**  We will use a combination of bottom-up and analogous estimating techniques. Bottom-up will be used for detailed tasks, while analogous will leverage past project data.
* **Cost Budgeting:**  The cost baseline will be developed based on the cost estimates.
* **Cost Control:**  Regular monitoring of actual costs against the budget will be performed.  Any variances will be investigated and addressed.
* **Cost Reporting:**  Regular cost reports will be generated and distributed to stakeholders.

**11. Funding Requirements**

Funding will be requested in two installments:

* **Installment 1:** 70% of the total budget at project initiation.
* **Installment 2:** 30% of the total budget upon completion of the planning phase.

**12. Cost Change Control Process**

Any proposed changes to the project budget will be submitted through a formal change request process.  The change request will include:

* A description of the proposed change.
* The rationale for the change.
* The impact on the project schedule and budget.
* A cost estimate for the change.

The change request will be reviewed and approved by the project manager and relevant stakeholders.

**13. Cost Estimation Methods and Approach**

* **Bottom-up Estimating:**  This will be used for detailed tasks, breaking down the work into smaller components and estimating the cost of each component.
* **Analogous Estimating:**  This will be used to estimate the cost of tasks based on similar projects completed in the past.
* **Three-Point Estimating:**  Where appropriate, we will use three-point estimating to account for uncertainty in the estimates.

**14. Cost Tracking Approach**

Cost tracking will be performed using the company's standard timesheet and expense reporting systems.  Regular reconciliation of actual costs against the budget will be performed to identify any variances.

**Appendix A: Example Cost Report Template** (To be included – a sample table showing the columns mentioned in Section 9)


This Cost Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in scope, schedule, or cost.
