# Cost Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

The Cost Management Plan defines the budgeting, estimating, funding, managing, and controlling of costs throughout the lifecycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan aligns with the PMBOK guidelines and ensures that project costs are planned, monitored, and controlled effectively to deliver the project within the approved budget.

## 3. Purpose of the Cost Management Plan

- Establish clear processes for cost estimating, budgeting, and controlling.
- Ensure cost visibility and accountability.
- Provide guidelines for identifying, documenting, and managing project costs.
- Support decision-making with timely and accurate cost information.
- Facilitate communication of cost status to stakeholders.

## 4. Cost Management Approach

| Activity                  | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cost Estimating          | Use a bottom-up estimating approach leveraging historical data, expert judgment, and vendor quotes for AI services and development resources. |
| Cost Budgeting           | Aggregate estimated costs to develop the project budget, including contingency reserves and management reserves.                   |
| Cost Control             | Monitor cost performance regularly through Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques and variance analysis. Implement corrective actions as needed. |
| Tools & Techniques       | Use project management software (e.g., MS Project, Jira with cost tracking plugins), spreadsheets, and AI-generated cost reports.    |
| Reporting                | Monthly cost status reports including Budget at Completion (BAC), Cost Performance Index (CPI), Estimate to Complete (ETC), and Variance at Completion (VAC). |

## 5. Cost Estimating

### 5.1 Estimating Methods

- **Resource Cost Rates:** Hourly rates for developers, AI specialists, PMs, and other resources.
- **AI Service Usage:** Estimated API consumption costs for Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama, and Azure AI Studio.
- **Infrastructure Costs:** Cloud resources, local environment setup, and licensing fees.
- **Contingency:** 10-15% of the total estimated cost for unknown risks and scope changes.
- **Expert Judgment:** Validation by project managers and finance team.

### 5.2 Cost Categories

| Category                 | Description                                                       |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Labor Costs              | Salaries, contractor fees, and consultant costs.                 |
| AI Provider Services     | Subscription and consumption-based fees for AI API usage.        |
| Software Licenses        | Licenses for development tools, libraries, and AI platforms.     |
| Infrastructure          | Cloud hosting, storage, network, and hardware expenses.          |
| Training & Support       | Training sessions and technical support costs.                   |
| Contingency Reserves     | Funds reserved for unforeseen costs and risks.                   |

---

## 6. Cost Budgeting

- Develop a detailed budget by summing all cost estimates.
- Incorporate contingency reserves based on risk assessment outcomes.
- Management reserves held separately for high-impact unknown risks.
- Baseline budget will be approved by project sponsor and key stakeholders.
- Budget allocations will be reviewed quarterly and adjusted if necessary.

---

## 7. Cost Control

### 7.1 Monitoring & Reporting

- Track actual costs against budgeted costs on a bi-weekly basis.
- Use Earned Value Management (EVM) metrics:
  - **Planned Value (PV)**
  - **Earned Value (EV)**
  - **Actual Cost (AC)**
  - **Cost Variance (CV) = EV - AC**
  - **Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC**
- Report cost status in project status meetings and monthly executive summaries.
- Identify cost variances > 5% for immediate review and corrective action.

### 7.2 Change Control

- Changes affecting cost must go through the formal Change Control Board (CCB).
- Cost impacts must be analyzed and approved before implementation.
- Update the cost baseline upon approved changes.

### 7.3 Forecasting

- Regularly forecast Estimate at Completion (EAC) and Variance at Completion (VAC) to predict final project costs.
- Use trend analysis to anticipate potential overruns.
