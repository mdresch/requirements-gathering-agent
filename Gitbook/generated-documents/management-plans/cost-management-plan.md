# Cost Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose  

The purpose of this Cost Management Plan is to establish the framework for managing, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan ensures project cost objectives are met, aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition standards, and supports informed decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.  

This plan defines the processes for cost estimation, budgeting, cost tracking, and cost control to ensure the project is delivered within the approved budget while meeting stakeholder expectations and quality requirements.  

---

## 2. Units of Measure  

All costs will be measured in:  
- **Currency:** USD ($)  
- **Staff Time:** Hours (h)  
- **Other Metrics:** Number of downloads, server utilization hours, and API call volume  

These units of measure will be applied consistently across all cost estimation, tracking, and reporting activities.  

---

## 3. Level of Precision and Accuracy  

### Level of Precision  
Cost estimates will be rounded to:  
- **Nearest Dollar ($)** for large costs (e.g., cloud infrastructure)  
- **Nearest Cent ($0.01)** for smaller costs (e.g., API calls, license fees)  

### Level of Accuracy  
Cost estimates will have an accuracy level of **±10%** to account for uncertainties in development, hosting, and AI model usage costs.  

---

## 4. Organizational Procedures Links  

Cost management procedures will adhere to the following organizational standards:  
- **Budget Approval Process:** Defined by the Project Management Office (PMO)  
- **Expense Authorization:** Follows organizational policies for procurement and expense approval  
- **Financial Reporting:** Aligned with monthly and quarterly reporting cycles  

Relevant organizational policies and templates will be stored in the project repository under `/organizational-assets/`.  

---

## 5. Control Thresholds  

Control thresholds define acceptable variances from the planned cost baseline:  
- **Cost Variance Threshold:** ±10% of the approved budget  
- **Action Trigger:** Variance exceeding ±10% will require a formal cost review and corrective action plan.  

---

## 6. Rules of Performance Measurement  

Earned Value Management (EVM) will be used for performance measurement:  
- **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost of work scheduled at a given point in time  
- **Actual Cost (AC):** Actual cost incurred for work completed  
- **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost of work performed  

Key performance metrics include:  
- **Cost Variance (CV):** EV - AC  
- **Schedule Variance (SV):** EV - PV  
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** EV / AC  
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** EV / PV  

---

## 7. Reporting Formats  

Cost reporting will follow the prescribed formats:  
### Monthly Budget Report  
- Projected vs. Actual Costs  
- Variance Analysis  
- Forecast for Remaining Costs  

### Weekly Status Update  
- Actual Costs Incurred  
- Resource Allocation Costs  

### Final Project Cost Summary  
- Total Project Cost  
- Variance Analysis  
- Lessons Learned  

Reports will be generated in **Excel** and **PDF** formats and stored in `/generated-documents/finance-reports/`.  

---

## 8. Process Descriptions  

### Cost Estimation  
Cost estimation will involve:  
- **Bottom-Up Estimation:** Calculating costs for individual work packages and summing them up  
- **Parametric Estimation:** Using historical data and industry benchmarks for scalable costs (e.g., server hours, API calls)  
- **Expert Judgment:** Consulting technical leads and product managers for accuracy  

### Budgeting  
The project budget will allocate costs to:  
- Infrastructure (e.g., Azure servers, AI models)  
- Development (e.g., salaries, licenses)  
- Documentation (e.g., tools, tutorials)  
- Marketing (e.g., milestone promotions)  

### Cost Control  
Cost control includes:  
- Continuous monitoring of actual costs against the budget  
- Implementing corrective actions for variances beyond thresholds  
- Using Earned Value Management (EVM) for performance tracking  

---

## 9. Funding Requirements  

Funding requirements are derived from the approved budget and include:  
- **Initial Development Costs:** $50,000 for TypeScript development, testing, and integration  
- **Recurring Hosting Costs:** $2,500/month for Azure AI services  
- **Marketing Budget:** $10,000 for milestone promotion and community engagement  
- **Contingency Reserve:** 15% of the total budget for unforeseen expenses  

Funding will be released in increments based on project milestones and deliverables.  

---

## 10. Cost Change Control Process  

Any changes to the approved project budget will follow this process:  
1. **Change Request Submission:** Submit formal change request to the PMO with justification and impact analysis.  
2. **Review and Approval:** PMO and key stakeholders review change request and approve/reject based on project priorities.  
3. **Budget Adjustment:** Update the project budget and cost baseline upon approval.  
4. **Documentation:** Record all approved changes in the **Change Log**.  

---

## 11. Cost Estimation Methods and Approach  

### Methods:  
1. **Analogous Estimation:** Use historical cost data from similar projects for baseline estimates.  
2. **Expert Judgement:** Leverage expertise from developers, architects, and AI specialists.  
3. **Parametric Modeling:** Estimate costs based on metrics such as API call volume and server hours.  

### Approach:  
- Costs will be estimated at the work package level based on the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**.  
- Estimates will be validated through cross-functional reviews.  
- Contingency reserves will be added to account for risks and uncertainties.  

---

## 12. Cost Tracking Approach  

Cost tracking will include:  
- **Tracking Tools:** Use project management software (e.g., MS Project, Jira) for cost tracking.  
- **Weekly Updates:** Monitor actual costs weekly and compare against the cost baseline.  
- **Variance Analysis:** Identify variances and address deviations promptly.  
- **Automated Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for exceeding control thresholds.  

All tracking data will be consolidated and stored in the `/project-reports/cost-tracking/` directory for review.
