**Description:** PMBOK Define Scope Process

---

### Define Scope Process for **Requirements Gathering Agent** Project  
The Define Scope process, aligned with PMBOK 7th Edition standards, involves systematically defining the project scope to ensure clarity, alignment with stakeholder expectations, and adherence to organizational objectives. Given the comprehensive nature of the Requirements Gathering Agent project, this process will leverage existing documentation, stakeholder inputs, and iterative refinement to ensure scope alignment.

---

## 1. **Objective**  
The objective of the Define Scope process is to create a detailed project scope statement that serves as a foundation for the project, ensuring all deliverables, boundaries, constraints, assumptions, and acceptance criteria are clearly articulated.

---

## 2. **Inputs**  
### 2.1 Project Charter  
The Project Charter outlines the high-level objectives, constraints, assumptions, and deliverables for the Requirements Gathering Agent project. This includes its purpose of automating PMBOK-compliant document creation and leveraging Azure OpenAI for AI-powered insights.

### 2.2 Requirements Documentation  
Key requirements documents, such as the **Requirements Management Plan** and **Project Context from README.md**, provide detailed functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and acceptance criteria.

### 2.3 Stakeholder Register  
The Stakeholder Register identifies key stakeholders, their needs, expectations, and influence over the project. This ensures the scope addresses stakeholder priorities effectively.

### 2.4 Organizational Process Assets (OPA)  
- Templates for scope management documentation  
- Lessons learned from previous similar projects  
- Approved standards for PMBOK-compliant documentation  

### 2.5 Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEF)  
- Industry standards (e.g., PMBOK compliance)  
- Regulatory requirements (e.g., data privacy for AI models)  
- Available AI infrastructure (e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI, Ollama models)  

### 2.6 Relevant Supporting Documentation  
- **Architecture Documentation**: Provides insights into the technical scope, including modular architecture and AI provider integration.  
- **Implementation Guide for Provider Selection**: Highlights functionalities such as interactive AI provider selection.  
- **Changelog**: Documents recent feature additions and system changes that may impact project scope.

## 3. **Tools and Techniques**  
### 3.1 Expert Judgment  
Stakeholder interviews and consultations with project managers, business analysts, and technical leads will provide domain-specific expertise to define the scope.

### 3.2 Document Analysis  
Existing documentation, such as the Project Charter, Requirements Management Plan, and Architecture documentation, will be analyzed to extract relevant scope elements.

### 3.3 Workshops  
Scope definition workshops will be conducted with stakeholders to clarify deliverables, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.

### 3.4 Alternatives Analysis  
Evaluate alternative approaches to achieve project objectives, such as selecting different AI providers or adjusting the modular architecture.

### 3.5 Product Analysis  
Break down the Requirements Gathering Agent’s functionality (e.g., PMBOK document generation, context management system) into detailed deliverables.

### 3.6 Decision-Making Techniques  
Use a prioritization matrix to rank scope elements based on stakeholder importance, feasibility, and alignment with project objectives.

## 4. **Activities**  
### 4.1 Stakeholder Engagement  
- Conduct workshops with stakeholders to gather inputs on deliverables, in-scope, and out-of-scope items.  
- Validate stakeholder expectations against project constraints.  

### 4.2 Scope Definition  
- Define detailed deliverables for the Requirements Gathering Agent, including AI-powered PMBOK document generation, CLI interface, and modular architecture.  
- Identify explicitly what is in-scope (e.g., PMBOK compliance validation) and out-of-scope (e.g., integration with non-PMBOK frameworks).  
- Document constraints, assumptions, and dependencies, such as reliance on Azure OpenAI services for AI processing.  

### 4.3 Acceptance Criteria  
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each deliverable (e.g., PMBOK compliance validation score ≥ 90%, CLI interface usability score ≥ 80%).  

### 4.4 Validation  
- Review the draft scope statement with stakeholders to ensure alignment with expectations and organizational goals.  

---

## 5. **Outputs**  
### 5.1 Project Scope Statement  
The Project Scope Statement will include:  
- **Project Objectives**: Automate PMBOK-compliant document generation using AI.  
- **Deliverables**:  
  - Comprehensive PMBOK document suite (e.g., Project Charter, Scope Management Plan).  
  - Modular architecture to support future extensions and integration.  
  - Interactive CLI interface for AI provider selection.  
- **Boundaries**:  
  - In-scope: AI-powered PMBOK document generation, context management system.  
  - Out-of-scope: Integration with non-PMBOK frameworks or tools.  
- **Constraints**:  
  - Reliance on Azure OpenAI for core functionality.  
  - Compliance with PMBOK standards throughout.  
- **Assumptions**:  
  - Stakeholders will provide comprehensive documentation inputs.  
  - AI provider availability remains stable during project execution.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**:  
  - PMBOK compliance validation score ≥ 90%.  
  - CLI usability score ≥ 80%.  

### 5.2 Updates to Other Documents  
- Updates to the **Requirements Documentation** based on workshops and scope definition activities.  
- Updates to the **Stakeholder Register** to reflect revised expectations and priorities.  

---

## 6. **Roles and Responsibilities**  
### Project Manager  
- Facilitate workshops and ensure stakeholder alignment.  
- Approve the finalized scope statement.

### Business Analyst  
- Analyze requirements and ensure scope definition reflects stakeholder needs.  

### Technical Lead  
- Provide insights into technical constraints and feasibility.  

### Stakeholders  
- Validate and approve scope boundaries and deliverables.

## 7. **Scope Management Plan Integration**  
The outputs of this Define Scope process will feed directly into the **Scope Management Plan**, outlining how scope changes will be managed, validated, and controlled.  

---

## 8. **Validation and Approval**  
The finalized scope statement will undergo review and approval by key stakeholders and the project sponsor to ensure alignment with project objectives and organizational goals.

---

## 9. **Change Management**  
Any changes to the scope will follow the formal change control process established in the Scope Management Plan, ensuring all stakeholders are informed, impacts are assessed, and approvals are obtained.

---

By adhering to this Define Scope process, the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project will establish a clear and actionable scope, reducing the risk of scope creep and ensuring successful delivery of the project objectives.
