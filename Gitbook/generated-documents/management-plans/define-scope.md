# Define Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

The **Define Scope Process** is a critical component of the Planning Process Group in PMBOK 7th Edition, ensuring alignment between stakeholder requirements, project objectives, and deliverables. This process establishes a detailed description of the project scope, including boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria. Below is a structured Define Scope Process tailored to the Requirements Gathering Agent project, based on PMBOK 7th Edition standards.

---

## 1. Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this Define Scope Process is to ensure that the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project scope is clearly articulated, validated by stakeholders, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle. By defining the scope comprehensively, the project team can:
- Identify all required deliverables.
- Prevent scope creep by explicitly documenting in-scope and out-of-scope items.
- Align project outcomes with stakeholder expectations and organizational goals.

---

## 2. Inputs
The following inputs are required for the Define Scope Process:

### 2.1 Project Documents
- **Project Charter**: High-level scope, objectives, success criteria, constraints, and assumptions.
- **Requirements Documentation**: Functional and non-functional requirements derived from stakeholder analysis and requirements elicitation workshops.
- **Stakeholder Register**: Information about stakeholder roles, interests, and influence.
- **Architecture Documentation**: Technical specifications and system design.
- **Organizational Process Assets**: Templates, historical data, lessons learned, and policies.
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors**: Regulatory requirements, industry standards, and AI provider constraints.

### 2.2 Key Tools and Techniques
- **Facilitation Workshops**: Collaborative sessions with stakeholders to clarify scope boundaries.
- **Document Analysis**: Review of existing project documentation for relevant information.
- **Decision-Making Techniques**: Voting or consensus-building to resolve scope disputes.
- **Expert Judgment**: Input from subject matter experts in PMBOK documentation, AI integration, and software development.
- **Requirements Gathering Agent Features**: PMBOK-compliant AI-powered tools to assist scope discovery.

## 3. Activities
The Define Scope Process involves the following structured activities:

### 3.1 Scope Identification
1. **Elicit Requirements**: Conduct requirements gathering workshops to understand stakeholder needs and expectations. Include project managers, business analysts, developers, and compliance officers.
2. **Analyze High-Value Documentation**: Use the Requirements Gathering Agent’s **Enhanced Context Manager** to identify relevant documentation such as:
   - Stakeholder requirements (e.g., `stakeholder-requirements.md`).
   - Architecture documentation (e.g., `architecture-overview.md`).
   - Planning documents (e.g., `project-scope.md`).
3. **Identify Boundaries**:
   - **In-Scope**: Deliverables such as PMBOK-compliant documents, CLI tools, and AI provider integration.
   - **Out-of-Scope**: Tasks such as the development of non-PMBOK-related features or integration with unsupported AI providers.

### 3.2 Define Deliverables
1. **Map Project Deliverables**:
   - Core deliverables include a **Scope Management Plan**, **Project Charter**, and PMBOK-required planning artifacts (e.g., Stakeholder Registers, Work Breakdown Structure).
   - Secondary deliverables include CLI enhancements and AI provider choice menus.
2. **Specify Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Deliverables must comply with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
   - Generated documents should be validated for completeness, quality, and consistency using Requirements Gathering Agent’s validation tools.

### 3.3 Document Scope Statement
1. **Develop Project Scope Statement**:
   - Define the project objectives, deliverables, exclusions, constraints, and assumptions in a formal document.
   - Utilize the AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator to ensure consistency in terminology and compliance.

### 3.4 Validate Scope with Stakeholders
1. **Stakeholder Review**:
   - Present the draft scope statement to key stakeholders for validation.
   - Use iterative feedback cycles to refine scope boundaries and deliverables.
2. **Baseline Approval**:
   - Obtain formal approval from stakeholders on the finalized scope statement to establish the scope baseline.

## 4. Outputs
The Define Scope Process generates the following outputs:

### 4.1 Key Deliverables
- **Project Scope Statement**: A detailed document that consolidates project objectives, deliverables, boundaries, and acceptance criteria.
- **Requirements Documentation**: Comprehensive requirements matrix aligned with stakeholder needs and project goals.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Documented criteria for validating project deliverables.

### 4.2 Supporting Artifacts
- **Scope Management Plan**: A plan detailing how the scope will be defined, validated, controlled, and updated throughout the project lifecycle.
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Hierarchical decomposition of project work into manageable components.
- **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed descriptions of each WBS element.

---

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities
### 5.1 Key Stakeholders
- **Project Manager**: Facilitates scope definition activities and ensures alignment with PMBOK standards.
- **Business Analysts**: Elicit detailed requirements and ensure traceability throughout the process.
- **Stakeholders**: Provide input for scope validation and approval.
- **Technical Leads**: Define technical constraints and boundaries for deliverables.
- **Compliance Officers**: Ensure regulatory and standards compliance.

### 5.2 Tools and Technology
- **Requirements Gathering Agent**: AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator to assist scope definition and validation.
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Enables intelligent context building and document generation.
- **Enhanced Context Manager**: Leverages multi-file analysis to enrich project understanding.

---

## 6. Monitoring and Controlling Scope
### 6.1 Scope Validation
1. **Periodic Reviews**: Conduct regular stakeholder reviews during milestone completions.
2. **Change Requests**: Use formal change management procedures to handle any scope adjustments.

### 6.2 Scope Control
1. **Scope Baseline**: Manage changes against the approved baseline to prevent scope creep.
2. **Variance Analysis**: Compare actual project scope with planned scope to identify deviations.

---

## 7. Success Criteria
The Define Scope Process will be considered successful if:
- The Project Scope Statement is validated and approved by all key stakeholders.
- All deliverables align with PMBOK 7.0 standards.
- The scope baseline is established and effectively controlled throughout the project lifecycle.

---

## 8. Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
### 8.1 Common Challenges
- **Ambiguities in Scope**: Stakeholders may have conflicting expectations or unclear requirements.
- **Scope Creep**: Uncontrolled changes to scope may impact project timelines and resources.

### 8.2 Mitigation Strategies
- **Collaborative Workshops**: Conduct facilitated sessions to address ambiguities and build consensus.
- **Change Control Process**: Implement a robust change management process to evaluate and approve scope changes.
