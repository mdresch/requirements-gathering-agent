## Create WBS Process

**Document ID:** WBS-PROC-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** PMBOK-Certified Project Manager


### 1. Process Overview

**1.1 Purpose and Objectives:** The purpose of this process is to create a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that decomposes the project scope into smaller, manageable components (work packages).  The objectives are to:

* Clearly define the project scope and deliverables.
* Provide a basis for planning, scheduling, budgeting, and resource allocation.
* Facilitate communication and understanding among stakeholders.
* Enable effective monitoring and control of project progress.

**1.2 Process Scope and Boundaries:** This process encompasses the creation of the WBS and its associated WBS dictionary. It starts with the approved project scope statement and ends with the finalized WBS and dictionary, ready for integration into the project schedule and other planning documents.  This process does *not* include the creation of the project schedule or resource allocation.

**1.3 Integration with Scope Management Processes:** This process is a key component of the Scope Management knowledge area and integrates with other scope management processes, including:

* **Plan Scope Management:** The WBS is a key output of the Plan Scope Management process.
* **Collect Requirements:** The WBS reflects the requirements documented in the requirements documentation.
* **Define Scope:** The WBS provides a detailed decomposition of the defined scope.
* **Validate Scope:** The WBS is used to validate that all work is included and only necessary work is included.
* **Control Scope:** The WBS serves as a baseline for managing changes to the project scope.

**1.4 PMBOK Process Group and Knowledge Area Alignment:** This process belongs to the Planning process group and the Scope Management knowledge area within the PMBOK Guide.


### 2. Process Inputs

* **Project Scope Statement:**  Provides a high-level description of the project objectives, deliverables, and boundaries.  (Refer to Project Scope Statement document ID: PSS-001)
* **Requirements Documentation:** Detailed description of the project requirements, including functional and non-functional requirements. (Refer to Requirements Documentation document ID: RD-001)
* **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** External factors that influence the project, such as organizational policies, standards, and regulations.
* **Organizational Process Assets:** Internal standards, procedures, templates, and historical information relevant to WBS creation.


### 3. Tools and Techniques

* **Decomposition Techniques:**  Methods used to break down the project scope into smaller components, such as top-down, bottom-up, or mind mapping.
* **Expert Judgment:**  Leveraging the knowledge and experience of project team members and stakeholders to refine the WBS.
* **Templates and Historical Information:** Using pre-existing WBS templates or information from previous projects to guide the creation process.
* **Rolling Wave Planning:**  Developing the WBS in phases, with greater detail provided for near-term tasks and less detail for future tasks.


### 4. Process Outputs

* **Scope Baseline (WBS, WBS Dictionary, Project Scope Statement):** The approved WBS, WBS dictionary, and project scope statement form the scope baseline, a formal agreement on the project's scope.
* **Project Documents Updates:**  Relevant project documents, such as the project management plan, are updated to reflect the finalized WBS.
* **Lessons Learned and Process Improvements:**  Documentation of any insights gained during the WBS creation process, identifying areas for future improvement.


### 5. WBS Development Activities

**5.1 Scope Decomposition Approach:** The chosen decomposition technique (e.g., top-down) will be documented and followed consistently.  The approach will ensure that all work required to complete the project is included and that the WBS is comprehensive and accurate.

**5.2 Work Package Definition Criteria:**  Clear criteria will be established for defining work packages, including:

* **Size:** Work packages should be small enough to be managed effectively but large enough to be meaningful.
* **Dependencies:**  Dependencies between work packages will be identified.
* **Deliverables:**  Each work package should have a clearly defined deliverable.
* **Estimates:**  Time, cost, and resource estimates will be assigned to each work package.

**5.3 Hierarchical Structure Development:**  The WBS will be developed using a hierarchical structure, with the project at the top level and progressively smaller components at lower levels.  A clear numbering system will be used to identify each component.

**5.4 100% Rule Application:**  The WBS must adhere to the 100% rule, ensuring that all elements of the project scope are included within the WBS.


### 6. Quality Considerations

**6.1 WBS Quality Criteria and Standards:**  The WBS will be evaluated against predefined quality criteria, ensuring it is:

* **Accurate:**  Reflects the project scope accurately.
* **Complete:**  Includes all necessary work.
* **Consistent:**  Uses consistent terminology and structure.
* **Clear:**  Easily understood by all stakeholders.

**6.2 Review and Validation Processes:**  Formal reviews and walkthroughs will be conducted to validate the WBS with key stakeholders.

**6.3 Stakeholder Approval Procedures:**  The finalized WBS will be formally approved by relevant stakeholders.

**6.4 Documentation Requirements:**  All WBS-related documentation, including the WBS itself and the WBS dictionary, will be maintained and updated as needed.


### 7. Process Guidelines

* **WBS Creation Best Practices:**  Adherence to established best practices for WBS development, including using appropriate decomposition techniques and defining clear work packages.
* **Common Decomposition Patterns:**  Using well-established decomposition patterns to ensure consistency and efficiency.
* **Work Package Sizing Guidelines:**  Following guidelines for appropriate work package size to ensure manageability.
* **Numbering and Coding Standards:**  Using a consistent numbering and coding system for the WBS.


### 8. Integration Points

* **Connection to Schedule Development:** The WBS provides the basis for developing the project schedule.
* **Resource Planning Integration:**  The WBS is used to identify the resources required for each work package.
* **Cost Estimation Alignment:**  The WBS provides the basis for estimating project costs.
* **Risk Identification Support:**  The WBS can help identify potential risks associated with specific work packages.


### 9. Process Metrics

* **WBS Quality Measurements:**  Metrics to assess the quality of the WBS, such as completeness, accuracy, and clarity.
* **Development Efficiency Metrics:**  Metrics to measure the efficiency of the WBS creation process, such as time taken and resources used.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction Indicators:**  Metrics to assess stakeholder satisfaction with the WBS.
* **Process Improvement Measures:**  Metrics to track improvements in the WBS creation process over time.


### 10. Risk Management

* **WBS-related Risks and Mitigation:**  Identification and mitigation of risks associated with the WBS creation process, such as scope creep, inaccurate estimates, and communication breakdowns.
* **Quality Assurance Procedures:**  Implementation of quality assurance procedures to ensure the WBS meets quality criteria.
* **Review and Approval Processes:**  Formal review and approval processes to ensure stakeholder buy-in.
* **Change Control Considerations:**  A formal change control process will be in place to manage changes to the WBS after approval.


This document provides a framework for creating a WBS.  Specific details may need to be adjusted based on the individual project's needs and context.
