## Create WBS Process

### 1. Process Overview

#### **Purpose and Objectives**
The purpose of the Create WBS process is to subdivide project deliverables and work into smaller, manageable components, known as work packages. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) serves as a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to accomplish project objectives and create deliverables. The primary objective is to ensure clarity of scope, enhance task manageability, and provide a foundation for scheduling, cost estimation, and resource allocation.

#### **Process Scope and Boundaries**
- **Scope:** Focuses exclusively on breaking down the project scope into discrete, deliverable-based work packages.
- **Boundaries:** Excludes activities related to executing or controlling the scope, which are handled in subsequent processes.

#### **Integration with Scope Management Processes**
The Create WBS process integrates closely with the **Define Scope** and **Validate Scope** processes, ensuring each work package aligns with project objectives and stakeholder requirements. It also serves as the foundation for resource planning, scheduling, and cost estimation.

#### **PMBOK Process Group**
- **Process Group:** Planning
- **Knowledge Area:** Project Scope Management

### 2. Process Inputs

#### **Key Inputs**
1. **Project Scope Statement**  
   - High-level scope, project objectives, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions.
2. **Requirements Documentation**  
   - Functional and non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, and stakeholder needs.
3. **Enterprise Environmental Factors (EEFs)**  
   - Industry standards, tools, organizational culture, and regulatory requirements impacting the WBS creation.
4. **Organizational Process Assets (OPAs)**  
   - Templates, historical WBS examples, lessons learned, and organizational guidelines.

---

### 3. Tools and Techniques

#### **Decomposition Techniques**
- Systematic method to break down project deliverables into smaller, more manageable work packages.
- Ensures each element is clearly defined and measurable.

#### **Expert Judgment**
- Involves consulting subject matter experts, project stakeholders, and experienced team members to guide the decomposition process.

#### **Templates and Historical Information**
- Utilizes organizational process assets, such as WBS templates and prior project documentation, to ensure consistency and accuracy.

#### **Rolling Wave Planning**
- Encourages progressive elaboration for portions of the WBS that are less defined, allowing detailed planning closer to execution.

---

### 4. Process Outputs

#### **Scope Baseline**
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Hierarchical representation of project scope and deliverables.
- **WBS Dictionary:** Provides detailed descriptions, assumptions, and criteria for each work package.
- **Project Scope Statement:** Updated to reflect any refinements during the WBS creation process.

#### **Project Documents Updates**
- Updates to requirements documentation, assumptions log, and scope-related artifacts.

#### **Lessons Learned and Process Improvements**
- Captures insights gained during WBS creation to improve future iterations and organizational processes.

---

### 5. WBS Development Activities

#### **Scope Decomposition Approach**
- Break down deliverables into smaller, executable work packages, ensuring alignment with project objectives.

#### **Work Package Definition Criteria**
- Define work packages based on deliverables, measurable outcomes, and clear boundaries for responsibility and accountability.

#### **Hierarchical Structure Development**
- Arrange work packages into a hierarchical format using numbering and coding standards for traceability.

#### **100% Rule Application**
- Ensure the WBS includes 100% of the project scope, capturing all work required while avoiding overlap or omissions.

---

### 6. Quality Considerations

#### **WBS Quality Criteria and Standards**
- Ensure work packages are specific, measurable, and aligned with deliverables.
- Maintain consistency with organizational standards and PMBOK guidelines.

#### **Review and Validation Processes**
- Conduct structured reviews with stakeholders to assess completeness, accuracy, and alignment with project scope.

#### **Stakeholder Approval Procedures**
- Obtain formal approval from key stakeholders to ensure consensus on the WBS structure and content.

#### **Documentation Requirements**
- Ensure the WBS and WBS Dictionary are documented comprehensively for future reference and audits.

---

### 7. Process Guidelines

#### **Best Practices**
- Involve key stakeholders in the WBS creation process to ensure clarity and alignment.
- Use historical information and templates to streamline development and maintain consistency.

#### **Common Decomposition Patterns**
- Deliverable-oriented decomposition (preferred approach).
- Phase-oriented decomposition for iterative or agile projects.

#### **Work Package Sizing Guidelines**
- Ensure work packages are sufficiently granular to allow accurate scheduling and cost estimation but not so small as to become unmanageable.

#### **Numbering and Coding Standards**
- Use consistent numbering conventions for hierarchical levels to improve traceability and communication.

---

### 8. Integration Points

#### **Connection to Schedule Development**
- Work packages form the foundation for activity identification, sequencing, and duration estimation.

#### **Resource Planning Integration**
- Each work package is linked to required resources, enabling precise resource allocation and leveling.

#### **Cost Estimation Alignment**
- Work packages facilitate accurate cost estimation, budget creation, and cost control.

#### **Risk Identification Support**
- Decomposed tasks help identify risks at a granular level, improving risk management strategies.

---

### 9. Process Metrics

#### **WBS Quality Measurements**
- Completeness of deliverables captured (100% rule adherence).
- Consistency with project scope statement and requirements documentation.

#### **Development Efficiency Metrics**
- Time taken to create the WBS compared to planned schedule.
- Resource utilization during WBS development.

#### **Stakeholder Satisfaction Indicators**
- Level of stakeholder approval and feedback during review sessions.
- Alignment of WBS with stakeholder expectations.

#### **Process Improvement Measures**
- Number of lessons learned captured and implemented for future processes.

---

### 10. Risk Management

#### **WBS-Related Risks and Mitigation**
- **Risk:** Incomplete or ambiguous WBS leading to scope creep.  
  - **Mitigation:** Review against project scope statement and requirements documentation.  
- **Risk:** Poor stakeholder engagement during WBS development.  
  - **Mitigation:** Conduct regular stakeholder workshops and reviews.

#### **Quality Assurance Procedures**
- Establish checkpoints and validation criteria for WBS quality.
- Use peer reviews and expert judgment to ensure accuracy.

#### **Review and Approval Processes**
- Implement formal review cycles with stakeholder sign-off at each iteration.

#### **Change Control Considerations**
- Define procedures for incorporating changes into the WBS (e.g., change request forms and impact analysis).
