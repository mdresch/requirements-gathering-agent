## Project Scope Statement: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, defining the work to be performed to deliver a functional and compliant AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documentation.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of the RGA project are to:

* Develop an AI-powered tool capable of generating a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project management documents.
* Automate the process of creating project documentation, reducing manual effort and improving consistency.
* Integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to offer flexibility and scalability.
* Ensure generated documents meet high quality standards through automated validation and quality assessment features.
* Deliver a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy access and operation.

**3. Project Deliverables**

The project will deliver the following:

* **Functional Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) Software:** A fully functional CLI application that meets all specified functional and non-functional requirements.  This includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  A complete set of user documentation, including installation guides, tutorials, and API references.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Validation Engine:**  An integrated engine to validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards, providing detailed compliance reports and quality scores.
* **Automated Quality Assessment:**  A system for assessing the quality of generated documents based on structure, content, and terminology.
* **Deployment Package:** A ready-to-deploy package for various environments.


**4. Project Scope (Inclusions)**

The RGA project includes:

* Development of the core RGA application using Node.js and TypeScript.
* Integration with specified AI providers, including authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Development of the CLI for user interaction.
* Implementation of the PMBOK 7.0 validation and quality assessment features.
* Generation of a comprehensive suite of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents (as detailed in the project README).
* Creation of user documentation and tutorials.
* Testing and quality assurance of the RGA application and generated documents.

**5. Project Scope (Exclusions)**

The RGA project explicitly excludes:

* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Integration with third-party project management software beyond data import/export of JSON files.
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial release.
* Training and consulting services for end-users.
* Customization of generated document templates beyond those defined in the scope.


**6. Acceptance Criteria**

The RGA project will be considered complete and accepted when:

* The RGA application successfully generates all specified PMBOK documents.
* Generated documents pass the PMBOK 7.0 validation and quality assessment checks with scores meeting predefined thresholds.
* The application demonstrates stable performance and error handling under various test conditions.
* All user documentation is complete and accurate.
* The application meets all defined functional and non-functional requirements.
* Stakeholder sign-off is obtained on the completed deliverables.


**7. Project Assumptions**

The project assumes:

* Access to necessary AI provider APIs and credentials.
* Availability of adequately skilled personnel for development and testing.
* Sufficient time and resources are allocated to complete the project within the defined timeframe and budget.
* The project's technical environment remains stable throughout development.

**8. Project Constraints**

The project is subject to the following constraints:

* Project timeline as defined in the project plan.
* Budget limitations as defined in the project plan.
* Availability of specific AI provider APIs and their associated rate limits.
* Adherence to internal development standards and processes.


**9. Stakeholders**

Key stakeholders include:

* Project Sponsor
* Project Manager
* Development Team
* Quality Assurance Team
* End-Users


This Project Scope Statement serves as a baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent project and will be used to guide project execution and manage changes throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to the scope will require a formal change request process.
