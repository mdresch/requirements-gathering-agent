# Project Scope Statement

## Project Name:
Requirements Gathering Agent

---

## 1. Project Purpose and Justification
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to deliver a Node.js/TypeScript-based Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that automates the creation of **Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)** 7th Edition-compliant project documentation. This tool leverages **Azure OpenAI** and other AI providers to streamline the documentation process, ensuring compliance, accuracy, and efficiency for project managers and business analysts.

### Problem Statement
Project documentation creation is traditionally **manual, time-consuming, error-prone**, and inconsistent across teams and projects. These inefficiencies lead to delays, compliance risks, and misaligned stakeholder expectations, ultimately impacting project success rates and increasing administrative overhead.

### Business Case
By automating the generation of PMBOK-aligned documents, the Requirements Gathering Agent addresses these challenges by:
- Reducing manual effort for project planning and documentation.
- Ensuring consistency and compliance with PMBOK standards.
- Enhancing stakeholder alignment and project governance.
- Saving time and resources, enabling teams to focus on higher-value activities.

This innovation has achieved **175 weekly downloads** on NPM, demonstrating strong market validation and adoption by **project managers** and **business analysts**.

## 2. Project Objectives
The objectives of the Requirements Gathering Agent project are:
- Develop a CLI tool that generates **29 PMBOK-compliant documents**, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, and risk management plans.
- Integrate seamlessly with **Azure OpenAI**, **Google AI**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **Ollama** for multi-provider support.
- Validate generated documents against PMBOK standards and ensure **cross-document consistency**.
- Enhance context management capabilities to intelligently analyze **project documentation beyond README.md** files.
- Provide a robust and modular architecture for future scalability and third-party integrations.
- Offer comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and advanced reporting features.

## 3. High-Level Project Scope
### Deliverables
The Requirements Gathering Agent will deliver the following:
1. **Core Functional Features:**
   - Automated generation of PMBOK-compliant documents.
   - PMBOK 7.0 validation and quality assessment.
   - Enhanced context management system for intelligent documentation prioritization.
   - CLI interface for efficient user interaction.

2. **Documentation Outputs:**
   - Project Charter.
   - Management Plans (Scope, Risk, Cost, Quality, Communication, etc.).
   - Planning Artifacts (Work Breakdown Structure, Activity List, Milestone List, etc.).
   - Stakeholder Analysis (Stakeholder Register, Stakeholder Engagement Plan).
   - Technical Analysis (Technology Stack, Risk Analysis, Compliance Considerations).

3. **Supporting Functionalities:**
   - Intelligent source discovery from project directories (e.g., `docs/`, `requirements/`).
   - Context prioritization and relevance scoring (0-100).
   - Integration with **large-context AI models** like Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M tokens).
   - Interactive AI provider selection menu for enhanced usability.

4. **Documentation Structure:**
   - Organized output directory (`generated-documents/`) with categorized subfolders:
     - `core-analysis/`
     - `project-charter/`
     - `management-plans/`
     - `planning-artifacts/`
     - `stakeholder-management/`
     - `technical-analysis/`

## 4. Project Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. The system must generate PMBOK-compliant documents based on the provided input files.
2. The CLI tool must integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).
3. The system must validate generated documents for compliance with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
4. The tool must analyze project directories and rank files based on relevance to project management concepts.
5. The tool must provide detailed quality scores and actionable recommendations for document improvements.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system must operate efficiently with large-context AI models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro).
2. The tool must ensure cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3. Generated outputs must be in professional markdown format, with optional JSON or YAML formats.
4. The system must handle errors gracefully with retry logic and detailed error reporting.

### Constraints
1. The tool must comply with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
2. The tool must operate within the token limits of integrated AI models (e.g., 2M tokens for Gemini 1.5 Pro).
3. The project must use TypeScript as the primary development language.

### Assumptions
- Stakeholders will provide access to accurate and comprehensive project documentation for analysis.
- Integration with AI providers is feasible and supported by their APIs.

---

## 5. Project Boundaries
### In-Scope
The project includes:
- Development of the Requirements Gathering Agent CLI tool.
- Integration of Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama for document generation.
- Comprehensive analysis of project directories to extract relevant content.
- Validation of PMBOK compliance for all generated outputs.

### Out-of-Scope
The project excludes:
- Development of a GUI interface (only CLI-based interaction is supported).
- Customization of PMBOK standards beyond the 7th Edition.
- Analysis of non-markdown or binary files (e.g., images, PDFs).

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
1. The CLI tool generates all 29 PMBOK-compliant documents with accuracy and consistency.
2. Generated documents pass PMBOK 7.0 validation with quality scores above 85%.
3. The tool integrates seamlessly with the specified AI providers and operates without critical errors.
4. The Enhanced Context Manager demonstrates context utilization above 50% for large AI models.
5. Stakeholders report satisfaction with usability, output quality, and compliance assurance.

---

## 7. Key Milestones
1. **Milestone 1:** Complete architecture design and finalize requirements (Week 1).
2. **Milestone 2:** Develop core CLI functionality and integrate Azure OpenAI (Week 4).
3. **Milestone 3:** Implement Enhanced Context Manager and AI provider integration (Week 8).
4. **Milestone 4:** Validate PMBOK compliance and cross-document consistency (Week 10).
5. **Milestone 5:** Launch Requirements Gathering Agent v1.0 on NPM and celebrate 175 weekly downloads (Week 12).

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigation Strategies
### Key Risks
1. **AI Provider Availability:** Downtime or limitations in AI provider APIs may impact functionality.
   - **Mitigation:** Implement fallback mechanisms and multi-provider support.
2. **Scope Creep:** Requests for additional features could delay delivery.
   - **Mitigation:** Clearly define and document in-scope and out-of-scope items.
3. **Context Overload:** Large projects may exceed token limits for AI models.
   - **Mitigation:** Use intelligent context prioritization and relevance scoring.
