### Project Scope Statement  
#### Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

### 1. Project Objectives  

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to develop an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool that automates the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. By leveraging Azure AI and other AI providers, the solution will reduce manual effort, ensure compliance with PMBOK 7th Edition standards, and enhance stakeholder alignment. The tool will also integrate seamlessly with enterprise project management workflows, offering significant time savings, enhanced accuracy, and improved documentation consistency.  

---

### 2. Product Scope Description  

The Requirements Gathering Agent will deliver the following key features:  

#### Functional Features:  
- **PMBOK Document Generation**: Creation of 29 PMBOK-compliant documents, including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope management plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.  
- **Enhanced Project Analysis**: Automatic discovery and analysis of all markdown files beyond README.md, including requirements, architecture, planning, and stakeholder documentation.  
- **AI-Powered Context Management**: Intelligent multi-phase context strategy to improve document accuracy and consistency, leveraging large language models like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro.  
- **Integration Support**: Compatibility with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and enterprise authentication frameworks like Azure Entra ID.  
- **Validation and Quality Control**: Built-in PMBOK 7th Edition compliance validation and document quality assessment with actionable recommendations.  
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools for document generation, validation, and context analysis.  

#### Non-Functional Features:  
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of large document sets with up to 2M tokens for ultra-large context models.  
- **Robust Error Handling**: Enhanced retry logic and fallback mechanisms for failed AI requests.  
- **Scalability**: Modular architecture to support future extensions and integration with third-party project management tools.  
- **User Documentation**: Comprehensive user guides, tutorials, and onboarding materials.

- **Generated PMBOK Documents**: A complete suite of project management documentation, including:  
  - Project Charter  
  - Stakeholder Register  
  - Scope Management Plan  
  - Risk Management Plan  
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary  
  - Detailed planning artifacts (e.g., activity lists, milestone lists, schedule network diagrams)  
  - Stakeholder Engagement Plan  

#### Supporting Deliverables:  
- **Documentation**:  
  - User manual and tutorials for installation and usage.  
  - Implementation guide for AI provider selection.  
  - API documentation for advanced integrations.

### 4. Project Constraints  

The project is subject to the following constraints:  
- **Technical Constraints**:  
  - Integration with AI providers must comply with their API limitations (e.g., token limits for GPT models).  
  - Compatibility with Node.js runtime environment and TypeScript standards.  
- **Budgetary Constraints**: Limited funding for additional AI provider licenses and infrastructure enhancements.  
- **Time Constraints**: The project must achieve a production-ready milestone within six months.  
- **Resource Constraints**: Availability of skilled developers and AI experts for implementation and testing.  

---

### 5. Assumptions  

The project assumes the following:  
- Stakeholders will provide adequate documentation (e.g., requirements, architecture files) for context enrichment.  
- AI models like GPT-4 and Gemini 1.5 Pro will remain accessible and reliable throughout the project.  
- The CLI tool will primarily target enterprise users with basic technical knowledge of Node.js environments.  
- The enhanced context management system will perform efficiently with large-scale project documentation.  

---

### 6. In-Scope and Out-of-Scope Items  

#### In-Scope:  
- Development of the Requirements Gathering Agent CLI tool.  
- Integration with multiple AI providers for document generation and validation.  
- Development of PMBOK-compliant templates for all required documents.  
- Implementation of the enhanced context manager for improved document accuracy.  
- Automated compliance validation and quality assurance reporting.  

#### Out-of-Scope:  
- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).  
- Custom document templates for non-PMBOK frameworks.  
- Integration with proprietary project management tools outside the standard APIs.  
- Manual generation of documents or ad-hoc customization for specific users.  

---

### 7. Acceptance Criteria  

The Requirements Gathering Agent will be considered successful if the following criteria are met:  
- The CLI tool generates PMBOK-compliant documents with >95% compliance validation scores.  
- The enhanced context manager can utilize up to 90% of token capacity for ultra-large models like Gemini 1.5 Pro.  
- The CLI tool performs robustly in enterprise environments, with <1% failure rate across AI provider integrations.  
- Stakeholder feedback confirms improved documentation quality, consistency, and time savings.

### 8. Risks  

#### Key Risks:  
1. **Technical Risk**: AI provider APIs may change, impacting integration and functionality.  
   - **Mitigation**: Implement modular architecture with fallback mechanisms for provider synchronization.  
2. **Operational Risk**: Stakeholders may not provide sufficient documentation for context enrichment.  
   - **Mitigation**: Include a discovery phase to identify and prioritize high-value documentation sources.  
3. **Compliance Risk**: Generated documents may fail PMBOK validation due to incomplete context.  
   - **Mitigation**: Enhance validation algorithms to ensure all required PMBOK elements are included.  
4. **Performance Risk**: Large-scale projects may overwhelm context management systems.  
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize token allocation and implement smart context pruning strategies.  

---

### 9. Summary  

The Requirements Gathering Agent project represents an innovative AI-powered solution to automate the creation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology and adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards, the project will deliver a scalable, enterprise-ready tool that transforms traditional documentation workflows. The scope of the project has been clearly defined to ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations and organizational goals, while addressing risks and constraints to ensure successful delivery.
