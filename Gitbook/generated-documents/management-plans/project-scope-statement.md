## Project Scope Statement: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that automatically generates comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documentation from a project's existing documentation, including the README file and other relevant project files.

**2. Project Objectives:**

*   Automate the creation of at least 29 PMBOK-compliant project management documents.
*   Achieve a minimum 90% accuracy rate in generating PMBOK-compliant documents.
*   Ensure the tool supports multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Develop a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) for easy interaction and configuration.
*   Implement a robust error handling and retry mechanism to ensure reliability.
*   Integrate a version control system (VCS) for generated documents.
*   Maintain a modular architecture allowing for easy expansion and customization.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation and support materials for users.


**3. Project Deliverables:**

*   A fully functional command-line tool (requirements-gathering-agent) packaged for distribution via npm.
*   A comprehensive suite of 29 PMBOK-compliant project management documents (listed in the README).  These will be organized into a structured directory.
*   A detailed user manual including installation instructions, usage examples, and troubleshooting guides.
*   A comprehensive API documentation (if applicable).
*   Unit and integration tests demonstrating functionality and compliance.

**4. Project Scope (Inclusions):**

*   Development of the core application logic for document generation.
*   Integration with specified AI providers.
*   Creation of a user-friendly command-line interface.
*   Implementation of robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
*   Development of a built-in version control system for generated documents.
*   Generation of a comprehensive suite of 29 PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents.
*   Creation of user documentation.
*   Testing and quality assurance of the tool and generated documents.

**5. Project Scope (Exclusions):**

*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Integration with third-party project management software (beyond basic file system interaction).
*   Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial release.
*   Customization of generated document templates beyond what's provided.
*   Training for end-users (documentation will be provided).
*   Support for AI providers beyond those explicitly listed.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

*   Successful completion of unit and integration tests with a minimum passing rate of 95%.
*   Successful generation of all 29 PMBOK-compliant documents with a minimum accuracy rate of 90% as determined by manual review against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
*   Positive user feedback on usability and functionality based on internal testing and user acceptance testing (UAT).
*   Successful deployment to npm.


**7. Project Assumptions:**

*   Access to necessary AI APIs and resources.
*   Availability of relevant project documentation for input.
*   Adequate resources (personnel, time, and budget) will be allocated.
*   The AI providers will maintain consistent API stability and functionality.


**8. Project Constraints:**

*   Project timeline (defined separately).
*   Budget (defined separately).
*   Resource availability (defined separately).
*   Dependencies on third-party libraries and APIs.


**9. Project Stakeholders:**

*   Project Manager (Menno Drescher)
*   Development Team
*   End-users (project managers, business analysts)


This Project Scope Statement serves as a baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent project. Any changes to the scope will require a formal change request process and approval.
