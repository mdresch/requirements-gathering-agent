  - **Impact:** Expected impact on scope, schedule, cost, and quality.  

### **Step 2: Log Change Request**  
- Record the change request in the **Change Log** using unique IDs for tracking.  
- Categorize the change (e.g., feature addition, scope adjustment, technical enhancement).  

### **Step 3: Analyze Change Request**  
- Evaluate the change request using inputs like performance data, project documents, and expert judgment.  
- Analyze impacts on:  
  - **Scope:** Does this align with the approved scope?  
  - **Schedule:** Will this require adjustments to deadlines?  
  - **Cost:** Does the budget accommodate this change?  
  - **Quality:** Will this affect deliverable quality?
