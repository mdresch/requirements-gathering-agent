# Perform Integration Change Control Process

**1. Purpose:** This document outlines the process for managing and controlling changes to the integration aspects of the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  This includes changes affecting the interaction between ADPA and external systems (e.g., Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama), data sources, and the integration of generated documents with other enterprise systems (e.g., SharePoint, Confluence).

**2. Scope:** This process covers all changes impacting ADPA's integration capabilities, including:

* **Changes to API Integrations:** Modifications to the way ADPA interacts with external AI providers or other APIs.
* **Data Source Changes:** Alterations to the location, format, or structure of data sources used by ADPA.
* **Document Integration Changes:** Modifications to how ADPA integrates its output (generated documents) with other enterprise systems.
* **Internal Integration Changes:** Changes to the internal modules and data flows within ADPA that affect its integration capabilities (e.g., changes to the context manager or document generation engine).


**3. Process:**

**3.1. Identify and Document the Change:**

* **Initiation:** A change request is initiated by any stakeholder (developer, project manager, client, etc.). The change request should clearly describe the proposed change, its impact, and the rationale behind it.  The request should be submitted through the established change management system (e.g., a Jira ticket with appropriate categorization and priority).  Include relevant documentation links (e.g., to the affected sections of the README or architecture documentation).
* **Assessment:** The project manager or designated change control board (CCB) reviews the change request for feasibility, impact, and alignment with project objectives.  This assessment considers the technical feasibility, resource requirements, and potential risks associated with the change. The CCB leverages the existing project documentation (README, architecture diagrams, etc.) to inform their assessment.
* **Documentation:** The change request is documented in detail, including:
    * Change ID
    * Requestor
    * Date of request
    * Description of the change
    * Impact assessment (technical, schedule, cost, risk)
    * Proposed solution
    * Justification
    * Required resources
    * Approval status

**3.2. Analyze and Evaluate the Change:**

* **Impact Analysis:** A thorough impact analysis is performed to determine the scope of the change and its effect on other project components. This analysis draws upon the existing project documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) to understand dependencies and potential ripple effects.
* **Risk Assessment:** The CCB assesses the risks associated with implementing the change, including technical risks, schedule delays, and cost overruns.
* **Feasibility Study:** A feasibility study may be conducted to determine if the change is technically possible within the constraints of the project.

**3.3. Obtain Approval:**

* **Review and Approval:** The change request is reviewed and approved by the appropriate stakeholders, typically the CCB.  Approval criteria should include alignment with project objectives, acceptable risk levels, and resource availability.
* **Formal Authorization:**  Upon approval, the change is formally authorized, and a change control number is assigned. This authorization is documented and recorded in the change management system.

**3.4. Implement the Change:**

* **Implementation Plan:** A detailed implementation plan is developed, outlining the steps required to implement the change.  This plan should include testing procedures, rollback strategies, and communication protocols.
* **Execution:** The change is implemented according to the approved plan.  Strict adherence to the plan is critical to mitigate risks.
* **Version Control:**  All code changes are managed using a version control system (Git, in this case), ensuring traceability and allowing for easy rollback if necessary.

**3.5. Verify and Validate the Change:**

* **Testing:** Thorough testing is performed to verify that the change has been implemented correctly and that it does not introduce new defects or negatively impact existing functionality.  This should include unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.
* **Validation:** The change is validated against the original change request and the acceptance criteria.
* **Documentation Update:** The project documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) is updated to reflect the implemented change.

**3.6. Close the Change Request:**

* **Documentation:** The change request is closed in the change management system, documenting the results of the verification and validation process.
* **Lessons Learned:**  Lessons learned from the change implementation process are documented and shared with the project team to improve future change management efforts.


**4. Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:** Oversees the change control process, ensures compliance, and makes final decisions.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):** Reviews and approves change requests.
* **Developers:** Implement the approved changes.
* **Testers:** Verify and validate the implemented changes.


**5. Tools and Techniques:**

* Change management software (e.g., Jira)
* Version control system (Git)
* Documentation management system


**6. Metrics:**

* Number of change requests
* Time to implement changes
* Cost of changes
* Number of defects introduced by changes


This process ensures that all integration changes are properly managed, minimizing disruption and maximizing the success of the ADPA project.  The process leverages the existing detailed project documentation to ensure a comprehensive and informed approach to change management.
