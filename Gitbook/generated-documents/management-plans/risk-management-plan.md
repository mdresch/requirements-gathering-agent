# Risk Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent Project  

---

## 1. Introduction  

### 1.1 Purpose  
The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to establish a structured approach for identifying, analyzing, responding to, and monitoring risks throughout the lifecycle of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. This plan ensures that risks are proactively managed, minimizing their impact on project objectives, deliverables, timelines, and resources.  

### 1.2 Scope  
This Risk Management Plan applies to all aspects of the Requirements Gathering Agent project, including its development, implementation, deployment, and ongoing maintenance. It covers risks related to technical, operational, organizational, and external factors that may affect project performance and outcomes.  

---

## 2. Methodology  

### 2.1 Approach  
The project team will follow PMBOK 7th Edition standards for risk management, emphasizing iterative risk identification, qualitative and quantitative assessments, and risk response planning. Risks will be categorized, prioritized, and documented systematically, with continuous monitoring and communication integrated into the project workflow.  

### 2.2 Tools and Techniques  
- **Risk Register:** Centralized repository for documenting risks, their characteristics, and mitigation strategies.  
- **Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS):** Hierarchical representation of risks based on categories.  
- **Risk Matrix:** Tool to evaluate and prioritize risks based on probability and impact.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** Quantitative analysis tool for predicting risk outcomes.  
- **SWOT Analysis:** Identification of internal and external risks through strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

## 5. Risk Probability and Impact Definitions  

### 5.1 Probability Levels  
| Level | Description                | Probability Range (%) |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Low   | Rare occurrence            | 0-20%                |
| Medium| Occasional occurrence       | 21-50%               |
| High  | Likely occurrence           | 51-100%              |

### 5.2 Impact Levels  
| Level | Description                | Impact on Project Objectives |
|-------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Low   | Minor impact               | Negligible delay or cost     |
| Medium| Moderate impact            | Disruption to timelines or resources |
| High  | Severe impact              | Major delay or failure to meet objectives |

---

## 6. Risk Tolerance Thresholds  

The project team will operate within the following risk tolerance thresholds:  
- **Cost:** Risks resulting in budget increases of less than 5% are considered acceptable.  
- **Schedule:** Delays of up to 2 weeks are tolerable within the timeline.  
- **Quality:** Minor deviations in PMBOK compliance are acceptable, provided corrective actions are feasible.

## 7. Risk Documentation  

### 7.1 Risk Register Format  

| Risk ID | Description           | Category        | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status |  
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|--------|  
| R1      | AI provider outage    | External Risk   | High        | High   | Implement fallback mechanisms | PM     | Open   |  
| R2      | Scope creep           | Organizational Risk | Medium   | Medium | Regular stakeholder reviews | BA     | Open   |

## 8. Risk Identification Techniques  

### 8.1 Techniques Used  
- **Brainstorming:** Team-based sessions to identify potential risks.  
- **Expert Interviews:** Discussions with subject matter experts, especially on AI integration and PMBOK compliance.

## 10. Risk Response Strategies  

### 10.1 Response Types  
1. **Avoid:** Change project plans to eliminate the risk.  
2. **Mitigate:** Reduce the probability or impact of the risk.  
3. **Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance, outsourcing).  
4. **Accept:** Acknowledge the risk and prepare contingencies.  

### 10.2 Response Examples  
- **Technical Risks:** Implement fallback AI providers to mitigate service disruptions.  
- **Operational Risks:** Schedule regular progress reviews to address delays early.
