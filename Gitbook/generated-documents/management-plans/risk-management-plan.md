# Risk Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

The Risk Management Plan for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project defines the approach, processes, and tools used to identify, analyze, respond to, monitor, and control project risks. This plan aligns with PMBOK standards and is tailored to the specifics of developing an AI-powered PMBOK documentation generator integrated with Azure OpenAI and other AI providers.

---

## 2. Purpose

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to:

- Proactively identify potential risks that may impact project objectives.
- Assess risk probability and impact to prioritize risk response efforts.
- Define risk response strategies to mitigate negative impacts or capitalize on opportunities.
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for risk management activities.
- Monitor and control risks throughout the project lifecycle to ensure timely mitigation.

---

## 3. Risk Management Approach

The project will implement an iterative and continuous risk management process integrated into the project lifecycle phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Monitoring & Controlling, and Closing.

- **Risk Identification:** Through workshops, interviews, and document analysis involving key stakeholders and technical teams.
- **Risk Analysis:** Qualitative and quantitative methods to assess probability, impact, and priority.
- **Risk Response Planning:** Defining mitigation, avoidance, transfer, acceptance, or exploitation strategies.
- **Risk Monitoring & Control:** Periodic risk reviews, risk re-assessments, and tracking risk status in the Risk Register.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                      | Responsibility                                      |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager           | Overall risk management leadership and decision-making. Facilitates risk management processes and communication. |
| Risk Owner               | Assigned to each identified risk; accountable for risk response planning and execution. |
| Technical Lead           | Provides expert input on technical risks and mitigation approaches. |
| QA Lead                  | Identifies quality and testing-related risks; ensures testing mitigations. |
| Stakeholders             | Participate in risk identification and provide input on risk impacts. |
| Risk Management Team     | Supports risk identification, analysis, and documentation. |

---

## 5. Risk Categories

Risk identification will consider the following categories:

- **Technical Risks:** AI model integration issues, software bugs, API limitations, platform compatibility.
- **Project Management Risks:** Schedule delays, resource availability, scope creep.
- **External Risks:** Changes in Azure OpenAI or other AI provider policies, regulatory/compliance changes.
- **Operational Risks:** Infrastructure failures, security breaches, data privacy concerns.
- **Stakeholder Risks:** Misalignment of expectations, communication gaps.
- **Quality Risks:** Inadequate testing, poor documentation generation quality.

---

## 6. Risk Identification Process

- Conduct brainstorming sessions with project team and stakeholders.
- Review historical data from similar AI/PMBOK tool projects.
- Analyze project documents including requirements, schedules, and technical specs.
- Utilize checklists and risk prompt lists based on AI software development and cloud integration projects.
- Update the Risk Register continuously as new risks emerge.

---

## 7. Risk Analysis

### 7.1 Qualitative Analysis

- Assess each identified risk’s Probability (Likelihood) on a scale:  
  - Very Low (1)  
  - Low (2)  
  - Medium (3)  
  - High (4)  
  - Very High (5)

- Assess Impact on project objectives (Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality) on a scale:  
  - Very Low (1)  
  - Low (2)  
  - Medium (3)  
  - High (4)  
  - Very High (5)

- Calculate Risk Score = Probability × Impact.

- Prioritize risks based on Risk Score to focus on high-priority risks.

### 7.2 Quantitative Analysis (If Needed)

- Use Monte Carlo simulations or decision tree analysis for high-impact risks if time and data permit.

## 8. Risk Response Planning

| Risk Response Strategy | Description | Application in Project Context |
|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Avoidance             | Change project plan to eliminate risk | E.g., avoid unsupported AI provider features. |
| Mitigation            | Reduce probability or impact | Implement retries and error handling for AI API calls. |
| Transfer              | Shift risk to third party | Use third-party SLAs for cloud services. |
| Acceptance           | Acknowledge risk without action | Low priority risks accepted with contingency. |
| Exploitation          | Actively pursue opportunities | Utilize new AI capabilities to improve outputs. |

Each risk will have a defined response plan, owner, and trigger criteria for action.

---

## 9. Risk Monitoring and Control

- Maintain a **Risk Register** document with current status, updates, and actions.
- Conduct bi-weekly risk review meetings integrated into sprint retrospectives and status reviews.
- Use issue tracking tools (e.g., GitHub Issues) for risk-related tasks.
- Update risk assessments based on project progress and external changes.
- Escalate critical risks to project sponsor and steering committee promptly.
