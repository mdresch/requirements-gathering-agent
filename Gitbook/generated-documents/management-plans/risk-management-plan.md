# Risk Management Plan  

## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Introduction and Purpose  

The purpose of this Risk Management Plan is to identify, assess, manage, and monitor risks associated with the development and deployment of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan ensures that risks are proactively addressed to minimize their impact on project objectives, including the delivery of AI-powered PMBOK-compliant documentation tools, integration with Azure AI, and adherence to software quality standards.  

This document aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition standards and serves as a guide for all stakeholders in managing risks effectively throughout the project lifecycle.  

---

## 2. Methodology and Approach  

The risk management approach for the Requirements Gathering Agent project follows the PMBOK framework, which includes:  
1. **Risk Identification**: Systematic identification of risks using brainstorming, expert judgment, and historical data analysis.  
2. **Risk Analysis**: Qualitative and quantitative analysis to prioritize risks based on probability and impact.  
3. **Risk Response Planning**: Development of strategies to mitigate, transfer, avoid, or accept risks.  
4. **Risk Monitoring and Control**: Continuous tracking of risks and their responses, performing updates as necessary.

## 4. Risk Categories and Breakdown Structure  

### Risk Categories  
1. **Technical Risks**: Risks associated with software architecture, AI integration, and CLI implementation.  
2. **Operational Risks**: Risks related to project execution, resource allocation, and team coordination.  
3. **Compliance Risks**: Risks of failing to adhere to PMBOK standards and organizational policies.  
4. **External Risks**: Risks arising from external dependencies, such as AI providers or regulatory changes.  
5. **Schedule Risks**: Risks impacting project timelines and milestones.  
6. **Quality Risks**: Risks affecting the accuracy, completeness, and usability of the generated documentation.

## 5. Risk Probability and Impact Definitions  

### Probability Definitions  
- **High**: Greater than 70% chance of occurrence.  
- **Medium**: Between 30% and 70% chance of occurrence.  
- **Low**: Less than 30% chance of occurrence.  

### Impact Definitions  
- **High**: Major disruption to project objectives or deliverables.  
- **Medium**: Significant but manageable effect on project objectives.  
- **Low**: Minor impact, easily mitigated.  

---

## 6. Risk Tolerance Thresholds  

The projectâ€™s risk tolerance thresholds are as follows:  
- **High Probability, High Impact**: Immediate mitigation required.  
- **Medium Probability, High Impact**: Mitigation strategy required during the planning phase.  
- **Low Probability, High Impact**: Monitor and prepare a contingency plan.  
- **Low Probability, Low Impact**: Acceptable risk; no mitigation required.  

---

## 7. Risk Documentation Approach  

Risks will be recorded in a **Risk Register**, which includes:  
- Risk ID  
- Description  
- Category  
- Probability  
- Impact  
- Mitigation Strategy  
- Owner  
- Status  

---

## 8. Risk Identification Techniques  

1. **Brainstorming**: Conduct brainstorming sessions with project team members.  
2. **Expert Judgment**: Consult AI experts, PMBOK specialists, and stakeholders.  
3. **Historical Data Analysis**: Evaluate similar projects for past risks and lessons learned.  
4. **SWOT Analysis**: Analyze project strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  
5. **Checklist Analysis**: Use predefined risk checklists for software development projects.  

---

## 9. Risk Analysis Approach  

### Qualitative Risk Analysis  
- Assess risks based on probability and impact using a **Risk Matrix**.  
- Prioritize risks into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** categories.  

### Quantitative Risk Analysis  
- Use **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** to calculate financial impacts of risks.  
- Perform sensitivity analysis for high-priority risks.  

---

## 10. Risk Response Strategies  

### Mitigation Strategies  
- **Avoidance**: Modify project scope or timeline to eliminate the risk.  
- **Mitigation**: Reduce the probability or impact of the risk (e.g., robust testing for CLI bugs).  
- **Transfer**: Shift risk responsibility to a third party (e.g., external providers for AI).  
- **Acceptance**: Acknowledge the risk and prepare a contingency plan.  

---

## 11. Risk Monitoring Approach  

- **Regular Risk Reviews**: Conduct weekly risk review meetings.  
- **Risk Register Updates**: Continuously update the Risk Register with new risks and statuses.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Track risk response effectiveness using metrics like risk resolution time.  
- **Change Control Board**: Address risks that require changes to project scope or schedule.  

---

## 12. Risk Communication Plan  

### Communication Channels  
- **Project Meetings**: Weekly team meetings to discuss risks and updates.  
- **Status Reports**: Include risk updates in regular project status reports.  
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Share critical risks with stakeholders through email or progress calls.  

### Risk Escalation Protocols  
- **High-Impact Risks**: Escalate immediately to the Project Sponsor.  
- **Medium-Impact Risks**: Discuss in weekly project meetings.  
- **Low-Impact Risks**: Monitor without escalation.
