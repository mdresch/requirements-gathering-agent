## Risk Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**1. Introduction**

This Risk Management Plan outlines the processes and procedures for managing risks associated with the development and deployment of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  It adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines and focuses on project-specific risks identified during planning.

**2. Risk Management Methodology and Approach**

The project will employ a proactive, iterative risk management approach.  This involves identifying risks early, continuously monitoring their status, and adapting responses as needed.  The process will follow these steps:

1. **Risk Identification:**  Brainstorming sessions, expert judgment, SWOT analysis, and review of project documentation (README, requirements documents, etc.).
2. **Qualitative Risk Analysis:** Assessing likelihood and impact using a predefined scale (Low, Medium, High).
3. **Quantitative Risk Analysis:** (Where applicable) Using techniques like sensitivity analysis, decision tree analysis, or Monte Carlo simulation for high-priority risks.
4. **Risk Response Planning:** Defining mitigation, avoidance, transfer, or acceptance strategies for each risk.
5. **Risk Monitoring and Control:** Tracking identified risks, regularly reviewing the risk register, and updating responses based on new information.

**3. Risk Categories and Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)**

The following risk categories and RBS are defined:

* **1.0 Project Risks:** Overall project risks impacting success.
    * **1.1 Schedule Risks:** Delays impacting project timelines.
        * 1.1.1 AI Integration Delays
        * 1.1.2 Testing Delays
        * 1.1.3 Documentation Delays
    * **1.2 Cost Risks:** Budget overruns.
        * 1.2.1 Azure API Usage Costs
        * 1.2.2 Resource Costs
    * **1.3 Scope Risks:** Uncontrolled changes to project scope.
        * 1.3.1 Requirement Changes
        * 1.3.2 Feature Creep
    * **1.4 Quality Risks:** Deliverables failing to meet quality standards.
        * 1.4.1 AI Model Accuracy Issues
        * 1.4.2 Software Bugs
* **2.0 Technical Risks:** Risks related to the technical implementation.
    * **2.1 AI Integration Risks:** Problems integrating with AI providers.
        * 2.1.1 API Changes/Outages
        * 2.1.2 Authentication Failures
        * 2.1.3 Model Performance Issues
    * **2.2 Software Development Risks:** Coding errors, bugs, or design flaws.
        * 2.2.1 Software Defects
        * 2.2.2 Integration Problems
    * **2.3 Security Risks:** Vulnerabilities compromising security.
        * 2.3.1 Data Breaches
        * 2.3.2 Credential Leaks
* **3.0 External Risks:** Risks outside the project team's direct control.
    * **3.1 Market Risks:** Changes in market demand or competition.
    * **3.2 Regulatory Risks:** Changes in regulations impacting AI usage.
    * **3.3 Vendor Risks:** Delays or issues with AI providers.


**4. Risk Probability and Impact Assessment Methods**

A qualitative assessment using a three-point scale (Low, Medium, High) will be used for both probability and impact.  The priority will be determined by multiplying the likelihood and impact scores (Low x Low = Low, High x High = High, etc.).

**5. Risk Response Strategies and Contingency Planning**

The following risk response strategies will be considered:

* **Mitigation:** Reducing the likelihood or impact of a risk.
* **Avoidance:** Eliminating the risk entirely.
* **Transfer:** Shifting the risk to a third party (e.g., insurance).
* **Acceptance:** Accepting the risk and its potential consequences.

Contingency plans will be developed for high-priority risks outlining specific actions to be taken if the risk materializes.

**6. Risk Monitoring and Control Procedures**

- **Regular Risk Reviews:** The risk register will be reviewed and updated weekly during project status meetings.  Monthly formal risk reviews will be held.
- **Risk Reporting:** Risk status will be reported to stakeholders in regular status updates and milestone reviews.
- **Issue Tracking:**  Any risks which become issues will be managed through the project's issue tracking system.
- **Risk Register Maintenance:** The Risk Register will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle, updated regularly with new information and responses.

**7. Risk Register Template and Documentation Requirements**

The Risk Register will be maintained using a spreadsheet or project management software and will include:

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Owner | Status | Response Strategy | Contingency Plan | Trigger/Event |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |


**8. Roles and Responsibilities for Risk Management**

| Role                   | Responsibility                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager        | Overall risk management leadership, decision-making   |
| Risk Manager           | Coordinate risk identification, analysis, response planning |
| Business Analyst       | Identify and assess requirements-related risks        |
| Technical Lead         | Identify and assess technical risks                   |

**9. Budget and Timing for Risk Management Activities**

A dedicated budget of 5% of the overall project budget will be allocated for risk management activities.  Risk management activities will be integrated throughout the project lifecycle, with dedicated time allocated during planning, execution, and monitoring phases.
