# Risk Management Plan

## 1. Introduction

This Risk Management Plan outlines the approach and methodology to identify, analyze, respond to, and monitor risks throughout the life cycle of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. This plan aligns with the PMBOK® Guide framework and leverages AI-powered tools for comprehensive risk assessment and mitigation.

---

## 2. Purpose and Objectives

- **Purpose**: To proactively identify potential risks that could impact project objectives and to develop effective risk responses to minimize negative impacts or capitalize on opportunities.
- **Objectives**:
  - Establish a structured risk management process.
  - Define roles and responsibilities for risk management.
  - Identify, assess, prioritize, and document project risks.
  - Develop and implement risk response strategies.
  - Monitor risks and adjust plans as necessary throughout the project.

## 3. Risk Management Approach

### 3.1 Risk Management Process

The project will follow the PMBOK Risk Management process groups:

- **Plan Risk Management**: Define how to conduct risk management activities.
- **Identify Risks**: Detect risks that could affect the project.
- **Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis**: Prioritize risks based on probability and impact.
- **Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis**: Numerically analyze the effect of risks (when applicable).
- **Plan Risk Responses**: Develop options and actions to enhance opportunities and reduce threats.
- **Implement Risk Responses**: Execute risk mitigation, avoidance, transfer, acceptance, or exploitation strategies.
- **Monitor Risks**: Track identified risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks, and evaluate the effectiveness of risk processes.

### 3.2 Tools and Techniques

- AI-powered risk analysis using `getAiRiskAnalysis` function from the requirements-gathering-agent to identify and assess risks.
- Risk workshops and brainstorming sessions with stakeholders.
- Risk registers and logs maintained and updated regularly.
- Probability and impact matrix for risk prioritization.
- Risk audits and reviews integrated with project status meetings.

## 4. Roles and Responsibilities

| Role                          | Responsibility                                         |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Project Manager**            | Lead risk management activities; update risk plan; ensure risk processes are followed. |
| **Risk Owner(s)**              | Own and manage specific risks; implement response strategies. |
| **Project Team Members**       | Assist in risk identification and assessment; report new risks. |
| **Stakeholders**               | Provide input on potential risks; support mitigation strategies. |
| **AI Risk Analysis Agent**     | Generate risk assessments and recommendations using AI tools. |

---

## 5. Risk Categories

- **Technical Risks**: AI model inaccuracies, integration challenges, technology stack changes, local AI performance.
- **Operational Risks**: Resource availability, skill gaps, dependencies on AI providers.
- **Project Management Risks**: Schedule delays, scope creep, inadequate communication.
- **External Risks**: Regulatory changes, vendor reliability, market shifts.
- **Security Risks**: Data privacy, authentication failures, unauthorized access.
- **Compliance Risks**: Non-compliance with industry standards or legal requirements.

---

## 6. Risk Identification

Risk identification will be conducted through:

- AI-generated risk analysis reports (`getAiRiskAnalysis`).
- Stakeholder interviews and workshops.
- Review of lessons learned from previous similar projects.
- Analysis of technology stack and architecture.
- Continuous monitoring during project execution.

---

## 7. Risk Analysis and Evaluation

### 7.1 Qualitative Analysis

- Each identified risk will be evaluated based on:
  - **Probability**: Likelihood of occurrence (Low, Medium, High).
  - **Impact**: Effect on project objectives (Low, Medium, High).
- Use a Probability-Impact Matrix to prioritize risks.

### 7.2 Quantitative Analysis

- For high-priority risks, quantitative methods such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis will be applied if data permits.
- AI-enabled tools may assist in estimating potential cost and schedule impacts.

---

## 8. Risk Response Planning

Risk response strategies will be developed according to risk type:

| Risk Type           | Response Strategies                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Threats**          | Avoid, Mitigate, Transfer, or Accept                 |
| **Opportunities**    | Exploit, Enhance, Share, or Accept                   |

Examples:

- **Technical Risk** (e.g., AI model limitations): Mitigate by validating outputs and fallback to alternative AI providers.
- **Schedule Risk**: Mitigate by including buffer times and parallel tasking.
- **Security Risk**: Avoid by implementing strict access controls and using enterprise-grade authentication (Azure Entra ID).
- **Vendor Risk**: Transfer by establishing SLAs and contracts with multiple AI providers.

---

## 9. Risk Monitoring and Control

- Risk Register will be continuously updated with new risks, status changes, and mitigation actions.
- Regular risk review meetings aligned with project status updates.
- Use AI tools to periodically reassess risk environment and surface emerging risks.
- Escalate critical risks to project sponsor or steering committee as needed.
- Document lessons learned related to risk management.
