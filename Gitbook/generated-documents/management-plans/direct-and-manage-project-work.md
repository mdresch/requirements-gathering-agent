## Direct and Manage Project Work: Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines the Direct and Manage Project Work process for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The plan integrates the provided project context, including the README, requirements documents, and identified issues.

**1. Project Scope and Objectives:**

The project aims to develop and deliver a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI (Azure OpenAI, with fallback options) to generate comprehensive PMBOK 7th Edition compliant project documentation from a project's existing documentation (primarily README and related markdown files).  Key objectives include:

* **Accurate Documentation Generation:**  Produce PMBOK-compliant documents with high accuracy and completeness.
* **Comprehensive Analysis:**  Analyze all relevant project documentation for context.
* **Efficient Process:** Automate the creation of project documentation, significantly reducing manual effort.
* **Robustness and Scalability:**  Handle diverse project structures and large volumes of data.
* **Compliance:** Adhere to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and relevant security and privacy regulations.


**2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

The project will be broken down into the following major work packages:

* **1.0 Project Setup and Planning:**  Includes defining the project scope, creating the WBS, developing the project management plan (including risk, communication, quality, resource, and procurement plans), and establishing the project baseline.
* **2.0 Development:**  Encompasses the design, coding, testing, and integration of the core application functionality, including AI integration, CLI development, and JSON output generation.  This includes addressing outstanding issues (zero tokens, CLI permissions, context utilization).
* **3.0 Testing and Quality Assurance:** This phase involves unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure the tool meets requirements and PMBOK standards.  This also includes validating the PMBOK compliance of generated documents.
* **4.0 Deployment and Release:**  This includes packaging the application, deploying to the chosen environment (e.g., npm), and creating release notes and user documentation.
* **5.0 Post-Implementation Review:**  Conducting a post-implementation review to assess project performance, identify lessons learned, and plan for future enhancements.

Each work package will be further decomposed into smaller tasks with assigned resources, durations, and dependencies.


**3. Resource Management:**

The project will require the following resources:

* **Project Manager:** Oversees all aspects of the project.
* **Software Developers (x2-3):** Responsible for coding, testing, and integration.
* **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Responsible for testing and validation.
* **Business Analyst:** Responsible for requirements gathering and documentation.
* **Azure OpenAI Subscription:**  For AI-powered document generation.


**4. Schedule Management:**

A detailed project schedule will be created using a suitable scheduling technique (e.g., critical path method) outlining task dependencies, durations, and milestones.  Regular progress monitoring and reporting will be employed to track progress against the schedule and identify any potential schedule slippage.


**5. Cost Management:**

A cost baseline will be established based on resource allocation and estimated task durations.  Regular cost monitoring and variance analysis will be performed to manage expenses and identify potential cost overruns.


**6. Risk Management:**

The project's potential risks, including technical challenges, resource constraints, and schedule delays, will be identified and assessed.  Contingency plans will be developed to mitigate identified risks.  The risk register will be updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle.


**7. Communication Management:**

A communication plan will define communication channels, frequency, and stakeholders involved.  Regular status meetings, progress reports, and risk updates will be communicated to stakeholders using appropriate methods.


**8. Quality Management:**

Quality will be ensured through rigorous testing, code reviews, and adherence to PMBOK standards.  The quality management plan will detail the quality control and quality assurance processes to be implemented throughout the project.


**9. Procurement Management:**

If any external resources or services are required (e.g., specialized testing tools), a procurement management plan will outline the process for selecting and managing these resources.


**10. Stakeholder Management:**

A stakeholder register will be maintained, identifying key stakeholders and their interests and influence.  A stakeholder engagement plan will outline strategies for managing communication and engagement with stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle.


**11. Monitoring and Controlling Project Work:**

Regular monitoring and control activities will be performed to track progress against the project plan and identify and address any deviations.  This includes regular status meetings, performance reporting, and change management procedures.  The project's progress will be tracked against key performance indicators (KPIs) defined during the planning phase.  This will include measuring the accuracy and completeness of the generated documents, the efficiency of the process, and adherence to the schedule and budget.


**12. Closing the Project:**

Upon successful completion of all project deliverables and acceptance by stakeholders, the project will be formally closed.  A post-implementation review will be conducted to document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement in future projects.

This plan provides a high-level overview.  A detailed project plan with specific tasks, timelines, resources, and responsibilities will be developed during the project initiation phase.  This plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as needed to reflect changes in project scope, risks, or other relevant factors.
