# Direct and Manage Project Work

This document outlines the plan for directing and managing the work involved in the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project.  This project leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks, aiming for a 90% reduction in requirements gathering time and delivery of Fortune 500 quality deliverables.  This plan focuses on the execution phase, assuming successful completion of the planning phase detailed in existing documentation (e.g., `02_REQUIREMENTS_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD`).

## 1. Project Team and Roles

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project execution, monitoring progress, managing risks, and ensuring adherence to the project plan.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for coding, testing, and deploying the API and associated components. This includes front-end and back-end development, API testing, and infrastructure management.  Specific roles within the team (e.g., front-end lead, back-end lead, DevOps engineer) are defined in separate team documentation.
* **Business Analyst:** Responsible for validating the generated outputs against BABOK v3 standards, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the framework generation. Also responsible for user acceptance testing.
* **Quality Assurance (QA) Team:** Responsible for conducting comprehensive testing of the API, including functional, performance, and security testing.  This includes both unit and integration tests.


## 2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The project work will be broken down into the following key work packages:

* **API Development:**
    * Design and implement API endpoints (Document Generation, Template Management).
    * Develop authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * Implement input validation and error handling.
    * Integrate with AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).
    * Develop job management system.
* **Template Development:**
    * Create and maintain a library of BABOK v3 compliant templates.
    * Develop a system for managing and updating templates.
* **Testing:**
    * Unit testing of individual components.
    * Integration testing of the entire system.
    * Performance testing to ensure scalability.
    * Security testing to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
    * User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with business stakeholders.
* **Documentation:**
    * Update and maintain the project documentation.
    * Create user guides and tutorials.
* **Deployment:**
    * Deploy the API to the production environment.
    * Configure monitoring and logging.


## 3. Project Schedule

A detailed Gantt chart outlining task dependencies and deadlines is maintained in a separate project management tool (e.g., Microsoft Project, Asana).  Key milestones include:

* **Milestone 1:** Completion of API core functionality (Document Generation API).
* **Milestone 2:** Completion of Template Management API.
* **Milestone 3:** Completion of all testing phases.
* **Milestone 4:** Successful deployment to production.

## 4. Resource Allocation

The project will utilize the following resources:

* **Personnel:**  The project team members listed above, with their respective time allocations tracked in the project management tool.
* **Software and Tools:**  Node.js, TypeScript, testing frameworks (Jest), AI provider APIs, project management software.
* **Hardware:**  Development and testing servers, cloud infrastructure (Azure).


## 5. Risk Management

Potential risks and mitigation strategies are identified and documented in a separate risk register.  Key risks include:

* **AI Provider API Limitations:**  Mitigation:  Implement fallback mechanisms and explore multiple AI providers.
* **Unexpected Bugs:** Mitigation:  Rigorous testing throughout the development lifecycle.
* **Deployment Issues:** Mitigation:  Thorough testing in a staging environment before production deployment.
* **Security Vulnerabilities:** Mitigation:  Employ secure coding practices and conduct regular security audits.


## 6. Communication Plan

Regular communication will be maintained through:

* **Daily Stand-up Meetings:**  Brief meetings to discuss progress and identify roadblocks.
* **Weekly Progress Reports:**  Formal reports to stakeholders summarizing progress and highlighting key issues.
* **Project Management Software:**  Centralized platform for task management, communication, and document sharing.


## 7. Quality Control

Quality control will be ensured through:

* **Code Reviews:**  Peer reviews of code to identify potential issues.
* **Automated Testing:**  Unit and integration tests to verify functionality and performance.
* **Manual Testing:**  Testing by QA team to identify edge cases and usability issues.
* **Compliance Audits:**  Regular checks to ensure BABOK v3 compliance.


## 8. Change Management

A formal change management process will be followed to manage any changes to the project scope, schedule, or budget.  All changes will be documented and approved by relevant stakeholders.

## 9. Project Closure

Upon successful completion of all milestones and acceptance criteria, the project will be formally closed.  This includes final documentation, knowledge transfer, and a post-project review to identify lessons learned.


This Direct and Manage Project Work plan provides a high-level overview.  More detailed information on specific work packages, tasks, and schedules is available in the project management tool and supporting documentation.
