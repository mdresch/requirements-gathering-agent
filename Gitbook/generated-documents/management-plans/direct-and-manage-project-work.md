## 4. Execution Strategy  
### 4.1 Core Activities  
1. **Initiating Development:**  
   - Set up the development environment for Node.js/TypeScript.  
   - Integrate Azure OpenAI and Google AI APIs for initial testing.  

2. **Requirements Gathering:**  
   - Conduct stakeholder workshops to validate project requirements.  
   - Use relevance scoring to prioritize documentation sources.  

3. **Architecture Design:**  
   - Implement the Enhanced Context Manager with three-phase strategies:  
     - **Core Context:** Prioritize critical documents (e.g., README.md, planning artifacts).  
     - **Ultra-Large Model Support:** Optimize for Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M tokens).  
     - **Large Model Supplementary:** Balance context for smaller models.  

4. **Document Generation Development:**  
   - Build the document generation engine using template-based structures.  
   - Ensure PMBOK compliance for project charters, stakeholder registers, and planning artifacts.  

5. **CLI Interface Implementation:**  
   - Develop interactive AI provider selection menu for CLI users.  
   - Add retry logic for failed document generation processes.  

6. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**  
   - Conduct unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests using Jest.  
   - Validate outputs against PMBOK standards and organizational templates.  

### 4.2 Deliverables  
- **Core PMBOK Documents:**  
  - Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Requirements Management Plan.  
- **Enhanced Planning Artifacts:**  
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), WBS Dictionary, Milestone List.  
- **Technical Documentation:**  
  - Architecture Design, CLI User Guide, Change Log.
