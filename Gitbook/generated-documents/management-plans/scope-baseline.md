# Scope Baseline Document: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**Document ID:** RGA-SB-001
**Revision:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Prepared by:**  [Your Name/Team Name]


## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The scope baseline defines the features, functionality, and deliverables of the RGA project that have been approved for execution.  This document summarizes the approved project scope, work breakdown structure (WBS), and WBS dictionary. It also outlines the process for managing and controlling changes to the scope baseline throughout the project lifecycle.


## 2. Approved Project Scope Statement

The approved project scope statement is summarized below.  The complete project scope statement, including detailed requirements, is documented in [link to full Project Scope Statement document - e.g., 03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD].

**Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates comprehensive Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) compliant project management documentation from project README files and other relevant project documentation.

**Project Objectives:**

* Automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* Improve the consistency and accuracy of project documentation.
* Reduce the time and effort required for project documentation.
* Integrate with Azure OpenAI and other AI providers.
* Provide a user-friendly CLI for easy operation.
* Ensure the generated documentation adheres to PMBOK 7.0 standards.

**Project Deliverables:**

* A functional CLI tool (Requirements Gathering Agent).
* A comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents (detailed list available in the full Project Scope Statement).
* User documentation and tutorials.
* Automated testing and validation procedures.


**Out of Scope:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (future consideration).
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) (future consideration).
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond the initial release (defined separately in a support agreement).


## 3. Approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The approved WBS for the RGA project is depicted below. A more detailed WBS, including work packages, is available in [link to full WBS document - e.g., 04_WBS_DOCUMENT.MD].  This high-level WBS provides a hierarchical decomposition of the project scope.

1.0 Project Management
    1.1 Project Planning
    1.2 Project Execution and Monitoring
    1.3 Project Closure
2.0 Requirements Gathering and Analysis
    2.1 Requirements Elicitation
    2.2 Requirements Analysis and Documentation
3.0 Software Development
    3.1 Design and Architecture
    3.2 Coding and Implementation
    3.3 Testing and Quality Assurance
4.0 Deployment and Release
5.0 Documentation and Training


## 4. Approved WBS Dictionary

The WBS dictionary provides detailed descriptions of each work package within the WBS. This includes acceptance criteria, responsible parties, and dependencies. The complete WBS dictionary is documented in [link to full WBS Dictionary document - e.g., 05_WBS_DICTIONARY.MD].


## 5. Scope Baseline Performance Measurement

The scope baseline will be used to measure project performance by comparing planned work (defined in the WBS and WBS dictionary) with actual work performed. Variance analysis will be conducted regularly to identify any deviations from the scope baseline.  Key metrics include:

* **Scope Creep:** Tracking any unauthorized changes or additions to the project scope.
* **Schedule Variance:** Comparing the planned schedule with the actual progress.
* **Cost Variance:** Comparing the planned budget with the actual costs.
* **Deliverable Completion:** Tracking the completion status of each deliverable defined in the WBS.


## 6. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates

The scope baseline is a controlled document.  Changes to the scope baseline will only be approved through a formal change control process. This process involves:

1. **Change Request Submission:** Any proposed changes to the scope must be submitted as a formal change request.
2. **Change Request Evaluation:** The change request will be evaluated based on its impact on the project schedule, budget, and risk profile.
3. **Change Approval:** The change request will be approved or rejected by the Change Control Board (CCB).
4. **Change Implementation:** If approved, the change will be implemented and documented.
5. **Baseline Update:**  The scope baseline will be formally updated to reflect the approved changes.  A new revision of this Scope Baseline document will be issued.


## 7. Relationship to Other Project Baselines

The scope baseline is closely related to other project baselines, including the schedule baseline and the cost baseline.  Changes to the scope baseline will typically necessitate updates to the schedule and cost baselines.  The project management team will ensure consistency and alignment between all three baselines.


## 8.  Acceptance Criteria for the Scope Baseline

This Scope Baseline document is considered accepted upon approval by the Project Sponsor and the Project Management Office (PMO).  Signatures will be obtained to formalize the acceptance.


This Scope Baseline document serves as a critical reference point throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that project efforts remain focused and aligned with the approved scope.  Any deviations must follow the change control process outlined above.
