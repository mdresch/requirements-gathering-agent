# Scope Baseline Document  

## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

---

## 1. Overview  

The Scope Baseline is a foundational document that defines the approved project scope, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and WBS Dictionary for the Requirements Gathering Agent project. It serves as the benchmark for scope-related performance measurement and provides guidance for managing scope changes and deviations throughout the project lifecycle.  

The Scope Baseline is aligned with PMBOK standards and integrates seamlessly with other project baselines, such as schedule and cost baselines, to ensure effective monitoring and control.

## 2. Approved Project Scope Statement  

### Summary  

The Requirements Gathering Agent project aims to deliver an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool that automates the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. The tool will leverage Azure OpenAI services to provide enhanced context management, stakeholder-specific insights, and PMBOK-aligned deliverables for software projects.  

### Key Objectives:  
- Automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation, including Project Charters, Stakeholder Registers, Scope Management Plans, and Risk Management Plans.  
- Provide enhanced context analysis to intelligently identify, prioritize, and integrate relevant project documentation.  
- Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards and facilitate seamless integration with existing project management workflows.  

### In-Scope:  
- Development of the CLI tool.  
- Integration with Azure OpenAI and other AI providers (Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).  
- Generation of comprehensive PMBOK-aligned documentation, including charters, management plans, and planning artifacts.  
- Support for modular architecture to enable future extensions and third-party integrations.  

### Out-of-Scope:  
- Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).  
- Customizations for industry-specific PMBOK extensions.  
- Integration with proprietary project management software beyond provided APIs.
