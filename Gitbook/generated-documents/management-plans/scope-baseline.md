# Scope Baseline Document: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**Document ID:** RGA-SB-001
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI-assisted Project Management System


## 1. Introduction

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The Scope Baseline defines the features, functionality, and deliverables that comprise the project. This baseline will be used as a benchmark for measuring project performance and managing changes throughout the project lifecycle.  It incorporates information derived from the approved Project Scope Statement (referenced in Section 2), the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (referenced in Section 3), and the WBS Dictionary (referenced in Section 4).


## 2. Approved Project Scope Statement

The approved Project Scope Statement (03_PROJECT_SCOPE_STATEMENT.MD, located in the `Gitbook\PMBOK_Documents\Planning\` directory) defines the overall objectives and boundaries of the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Key aspects included in the Project Scope Statement are:

* **Project Goal:** To develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered CLI tool that automates the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation from existing project documentation.
* **Project Deliverables:**  A functional CLI application (requirements-gathering-agent) capable of generating a comprehensive suite of PMBOK documents (detailed list in Project Scope Statement).  This includes, but is not limited to, a project charter, scope management plan, risk management plan, stakeholder register, and other planning artifacts.  The tool will support multiple AI providers.
* **Project Exclusions:**  Integration with third-party project management software (future enhancement), support for non-markdown input formats (future enhancement).
* **Acceptance Criteria:**  Successful generation of complete and accurate PMBOK-compliant documents based on provided input data, successful execution of all CLI commands, and positive feedback from user acceptance testing.

The complete Project Scope Statement is available as a separate document and is considered a critical component of this Scope Baseline.


## 3. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

The approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) provides a hierarchical decomposition of the project into manageable work packages. The WBS is represented visually in a separate document (not included directly in this baseline for brevity, but the path is `planning-artifacts/wbs.md` in the output directory).  The WBS is organized by major project phases and deliverables, allowing for granular tracking of progress and resource allocation.


## 4. WBS Dictionary

The WBS Dictionary (located in `planning-artifacts/wbs-dictionary.md` in the output directory) provides detailed descriptions of each work package identified in the WBS. This dictionary clarifies the scope, deliverables, resource requirements, and time estimates for each work package.  It serves as a critical reference for the project team and stakeholders.


## 5. Scope Baseline Usage for Performance Measurement

The Scope Baseline will be used as the primary reference for measuring project performance.  The following metrics will be tracked against the Scope Baseline:

* **Scope Variance:**  Tracking deviations between planned and actual work performed.
* **Schedule Variance:**  Monitoring delays or advancements against the project schedule.
* **Cost Variance:**  Measuring deviations in project costs against the approved budget.
* **Deliverable Completion:** Tracking the completion of individual work packages and deliverables.

Regular monitoring of these metrics will allow for early identification of scope creep or other issues that might impact project success.


## 6. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates

The Scope Baseline is a living document subject to change management procedures.  Any proposed changes to the Scope Baseline must be formally documented using a Change Request form.  The Change Request will undergo a formal review process, including assessment of impact on schedule, cost, and other project parameters.  Approved changes will be incorporated into a revised Scope Baseline document, and the version history will be maintained.  The process for managing changes to the scope baseline is detailed in the Change Management Plan (located within the `management-plans` directory in the output).


## 7. Relationship to Other Project Baselines

The Scope Baseline is closely related to other project baselines, including:

* **Schedule Baseline:** The approved project schedule, reflecting planned start and finish dates for all work packages.  Changes to the Scope Baseline may necessitate updates to the Schedule Baseline.
* **Cost Baseline:** The approved project budget, outlining planned costs for all work packages.  Scope changes may impact the Cost Baseline.
* **Quality Baseline:** The defined quality standards and acceptance criteria for project deliverables.  Scope changes may require adjustments to the Quality Baseline.

Maintaining consistency and traceability between the Scope Baseline and other project baselines is crucial for effective project management.


## 8. Conclusion

This Scope Baseline Document provides a clear and concise definition of the scope for the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  By adhering to this baseline and employing rigorous change management processes, the project team will strive to deliver the project on time, within budget, and to the agreed-upon quality standards.  Regular monitoring and review of this baseline are essential to ensure project success.
