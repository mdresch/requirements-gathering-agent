# Scope Baseline Document  

## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent  

### Document Version: 1.0  
### Created: December 2024

## 1. Introduction  

The **Scope Baseline** is a critical component of the Requirements Gathering Agent project and serves as the foundation for scope management throughout the project lifecycle. It consists of the **approved Project Scope Statement**, **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**, and **WBS Dictionary**. This document ensures alignment among stakeholders, supports performance measurement, and facilitates scope control and updates.

## 2. Components of the Scope Baseline  

### 2.1 Approved Project Scope Statement  

The **Project Scope Statement** defines the boundaries, deliverables, and objectives of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. Below is a summary of the approved scope statement:  

#### 2.1.1 Scope Overview  
The Requirements Gathering Agent is an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation. The tool integrates with Azure AI and other providers to produce high-quality, standardized documents such as project charters, stakeholder registers, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures.  

#### 2.1.2 Deliverables  
The primary deliverables of the project include:  
- A CLI tool supporting document generation and validation.  
- Comprehensive PMBOK-aligned documentation suite (29 documents).  
- Modular architecture for future integrations with third-party tools.  
- User tutorials, onboarding materials, and configuration guides.  

#### 2.1.3 In-Scope Items  
The following items are explicitly included in the scope:  
- Integration with Azure AI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, and Ollama.  
- Enhanced context management system for improved documentation accuracy.  
- PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation features.  
- Support for enterprise-scale documentation generation.  

#### 2.1.4 Out-of-Scope Items  
The following items are explicitly excluded from the scope:  
- Customization of PMBOK documentation for non-standard frameworks.  
- Development of non-CLI user interfaces (e.g., web-based tools).  
- Support for AI models outside the listed providers.  

#### 2.1.5 Constraints  
- The project must adhere to PMBOK 7.0 guidelines.  
- Integration must be limited to AI providers mentioned in the project charter (Azure AI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).  
- The CLI tool must operate within Node.js/TypeScript runtime environments.  

#### 2.1.6 Acceptance Criteria  
Deliverables will be considered complete when:  
- All PMBOK documents are generated and validated successfully.  
- The CLI tool passes all functional and integration tests.  
- User documentation is published, and stakeholders confirm usability.

  - 1.1.1 Develop Project Charter  
  - 1.1.2 Identify Stakeholders  

- **1.2 Planning**  
  - 1.2.1 Define Scope  
  - 1.2.2 Develop Work Breakdown Structure  
  - 1.2.3 Create Scope Management Plan  
  - 1.2.4 Develop Requirements Management Plan  

- **1.3 Development**  
  - 1.3.1 Build CLI Tool  
  - 1.3.2 Integrate AI Providers  
  - 1.3.3 Implement Context Management System  

- **1.4 Validation**

### 2.3 Approved WBS Dictionary  

The **WBS Dictionary** provides detailed descriptions of each work package in the WBS, including deliverables, activities, and resources. Below are examples of key entries in the WBS Dictionary:  

#### Work Package: 1.1.1 Develop Project Charter  
- **Description:** Create a comprehensive project charter based on PMBOK guidelines.  
- **Deliverables:** Approved project charter document.  
- **Resources:** Project Manager, Business Analyst, AI system for context validation.  
- **Dependencies:** Stakeholder identification (1.1.2).  

#### Work Package: 1.3.1 Build CLI Tool  
- **Description:** Develop a Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool for PMBOK document generation.  
- **Deliverables:** Fully functional CLI tool, validated by integration tests.  
- **Resources:** Development team, Azure AI SDK, TypeScript libraries.  
- **Dependencies:** Scope definition (1.2.1), AI provider integration (1.3.2).  

#### Work Package: 1.4.3 Validate PMBOK Compliance  
- **Description:** Perform validation of all generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.  
- **Deliverables:** Compliance validation report.  
- **Resources:** QA team, PMBOK compliance checklist.

## 3. Scope Baseline Usage for Performance Measurement  

The Scope Baseline will serve as the foundation for performance measurement throughout the project. Key applications include:  
- **Scope Validation:** Ensuring deliverables meet acceptance criteria.  
- **Progress Monitoring:** Tracking completion of WBS work packages.  
- **Change Control:** Evaluating and approving scope changes against the baseline.  
- **Stakeholder Communication:** Providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of project boundaries.

## 4. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates  

### 4.1 Change Control Process  
Any changes to the scope baseline must follow the formal change control process:  
1. **Change Request Submission:** Stakeholders submit change requests via the projectâ€™s change request form.  
2. **Impact Analysis:** The Project Manager evaluates impacts on schedule, cost, and quality.  
3. **Approval:** The Change Control Board (CCB) reviews and approves/rejects the request.  
4. **Baseline Update:** Approved changes are documented in the updated scope baseline.  

### 4.2 Document Revision Guidelines  
- Revisions to the Scope Statement, WBS, or WBS Dictionary will be logged in the change log.  
- Stakeholders will be informed of baseline updates during regular status meetings.

## 5. Relationship Between Scope Baseline and Other Project Baselines  

The Scope Baseline interacts closely with other project baselines:  

### 5.1 Schedule Baseline  
The WBS serves as the foundation for developing the project schedule. Activities identified in the WBS are used to estimate durations, create the schedule network diagram, and define milestones.  

### 5.2 Cost Baseline  
Work packages in the WBS are used to estimate costs and allocate
