# Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) - ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**Version:** 1.0


This RTM traces requirements from the project's high-level goals and functional specifications to the implemented features and test cases.  Due to the dynamic nature of AI-driven generation, exhaustive test cases for all possible scenarios are impractical.  This matrix focuses on key functional areas and representative test cases.

**Note:** This RTM is a sample and should be expanded to include all requirements and relevant test cases for the project.  The "Notes" column can be used to record any additional information or issues encountered during testing or implementation.  The inclusion of specific test case IDs allows for direct traceability to a more comprehensive test plan.
