# Control Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent Project  
### PMBOK 7th Edition Alignment  

The **Control Scope Process** ensures that the project scope is effectively monitored, managed, and controlled to prevent scope creep, maintain alignment with stakeholder expectations, and deliver the agreed-upon project deliverables. The process is aligned with **PMBOK 7th Edition standards**, emphasizing iterative scope validation, proactive monitoring, and adaptive responses to changes.  

---

## 1. Purpose  
The purpose of this **Control Scope Process** is to ensure that the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent project is defined, monitored, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle. This process will help maintain alignment with the project objectives, stakeholder requirements, and PMBOK compliance standards while minimizing deviations from the approved scope baseline.

### 3.2 Scope Assessment  
- **Relevance Scoring**:  
  Utilize the intelligent scoring algorithm (0-100) to prioritize files and ensure high-value documents contribute to scope validation.  

### 3.3 Change Control  
- **Change Request Evaluation**:  
  Evaluate all change requests against the project scope, constraints, and stakeholder requirements.  

- **Impact Analysis**:  
  Assess the impact of proposed changes on timeline, budget, resources, and deliverables.  

- **Change Approval Process**:  
  Implement a formal approval process for scope changes, including stakeholder review and project manager sign-off.  

### 3.4 Scope Reporting  
- **Progress Reporting**:  
  Generate weekly project scope progress reports using the Requirements Gathering Agent.  
  Include detailed metrics on scope compliance, deviations, and corrective actions.  

- **Performance Metrics**:  
  Use PMBOK-aligned metrics such as completion rates for deliverables, scope creep percentage, and stakeholder satisfaction scores.
