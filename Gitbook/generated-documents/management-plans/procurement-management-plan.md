**3. Procurement Strategy and Approach**

- **Competitive Bidding:**  For Azure AI services, given their various options, a competitive bidding approach (Request for Quote - RFQ) will be used to select the most cost-effective and performance-optimized option.
- **Negotiated Procurement:**  For GitHub AI, Ollama, and Azure AI Studio, a negotiated procurement approach will be used, based on their publicly available APIs and documentation.
- **Fixed-Price Contracts:**  For training materials development, a fixed-price contract will be used to clearly define the scope and deliverables, minimizing cost overruns.

**4. Contract Types and Procurement Methods**

- **Fixed-Price Contracts:**  Used for well-defined deliverables with minimal anticipated changes.
- **Time and Materials Contracts:**  Used for activities with uncertain effort, such as AI integration testing and debugging.
- **Purchase Orders:**  Used for acquiring standard software licenses and tools.

**5. Vendor Selection Criteria and Evaluation Processes**
