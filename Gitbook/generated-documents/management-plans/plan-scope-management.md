# Scope Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent Project  

## 1. Introduction  
This Scope Management Plan provides a structured approach to defining, validating, and controlling the scope of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. Its purpose is to ensure that all required work and only the required work is performed, aligning with stakeholder expectations, project objectives, and PMBOK standards.  

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach  
The scope will be managed through iterative processes, including requirements elicitation, scope definition, scope validation, and scope control. A formal mechanism for tracking changes and preventing scope creep will be implemented. Specific attention will be given to leveraging AI tools for generating PMBOK-compliant documentation.  

Key tools and techniques include:  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent** for automated PMBOK-compliant document generation.  
- **Stakeholder workshops** for scope validation and alignment.  
- **Change control processes** for managing scope modifications.  

---

## 3. Scope Definition Process  

### 3.1 Inputs  
- **Project Charter:** High-level scope, objectives, constraints, and assumptions.  
- **Stakeholder Register:** Stakeholder requirements and expectations.  
- **Requirements Documentation:** Detailed functional and non-functional requirements.  
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors:** Industry standards and regulatory requirements.  
- **Organizational Process Assets:** Templates, lessons learned, and historical data.  

### 3.2 Activities  
- **Requirements Elicitation:** Conduct workshops and interviews with stakeholders to gather detailed requirements.  
- **Scope Statement Development:** Document deliverables, boundaries, constraints, and assumptions.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Create a hierarchical decomposition of project deliverables.  
- **Scope Validation:** Review deliverables with stakeholders to ensure alignment with objectives.  

### 3.3 Outputs  
- **Detailed Scope Statement:** Comprehensive documentation of project scope.  
- **WBS and WBS Dictionary:** Structured breakdown of deliverables and associated work packages.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Criteria for evaluating project deliverables.  
- **Assumptions Log:** Record of assumptions impacting scope.

## 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)  

### WBS Overview  
The WBS will decompose the project into manageable components, organized hierarchically:  
1. **Project Initiation:** Creation of project charter and stakeholder register.  
2. **Scope Definition:** Development of scope statement, requirements documentation, and WBS.  
3. **Document Generation:** Automated creation of PMBOK-compliant documents (e.g., scope management plan, risk management plan).  
4. **Validation and Quality Assurance:** Review of generated documents for PMBOK compliance and stakeholder approval.  

### WBS Dictionary  
Each work package in the WBS will have a detailed dictionary entry that includes:  
- Work package name and description.  
- Deliverables associated with the work package.  
- Acceptance criteria for deliverables.  
- Resources required (human, technical, and material).  
- Estimated duration and dependencies.  

---

## 5. Scope Validation  

### Purpose  
Scope validation ensures that deliverables meet stakeholder expectations and align with project objectives. Validation will occur at key milestones, including:  
1. Completion of requirements documentation.  
2. Creation of PMBOK-compliant documents.  
3. Review of final deliverables.  

### Techniques  
- **Stakeholder Reviews:** Formal meetings to validate deliverables.  
- **Acceptance Criteria Verification:** Ensure deliverables meet predefined criteria.  
- **Prototyping:** Provide stakeholders with preliminary outputs for feedback.  

---

## 6. Scope Control  

### Change Control Process  
A change control process will be implemented to manage scope changes effectively. Requests for changes will be documented and evaluated based on their impact on project objectives, schedule, and budget.  

#### Change Control Steps:  
1. **Identify Change Request:** Document the request, including rationale and expected benefits.  
2. **Analyze Impact:** Assess the impact on scope, schedule, cost, and quality.  
3. **Approval/Rejection:** The project manager and stakeholders will review and approve/reject the change.  
4. **Update Scope Documentation:** Revise the scope statement, WBS, and related documents if the change is approved.  

### Scope Control Tools  
- **Scope Baseline:** WBS, WBS Dictionary, and scope statement.  
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** Ensure all requirements are linked to deliverables.  
- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor scope performance against the baseline.  

---

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities  

### Project Manager  
- Ensure the scope management plan is followed.  
- Manage change control processes.  
- Monitor scope performance and address deviations.  

### Stakeholders  
- Provide input for scope definition and validation.  
- Review and approve deliverables.  

### Development Team  
- Execute work packages as defined in the WBS.  
- Deliver outputs that meet acceptance criteria.  

---

## 8. Scope Management Tools and Techniques  

### Tools  
1. **Requirements Gathering Agent:** Automated generation of PMBOK-compliant scope documentation.  
2. **WBS Software:** Tools for creating and managing hierarchical deliverables.  
3. **Collaboration Platforms:** Tools for stakeholder communication and document sharing.  

### Techniques  
- **Expert Judgment:** Leverage expertise in PMBOK standards and AI-driven project documentation.  
- **Facilitated Workshops:** Conduct interactive sessions with stakeholders to define scope.  
- **Data Analysis:** Use quantitative methods to assess scope performance and forecast changes.  

---

## 9. Performance Metrics  

### Scope Performance Indicators  
- **Scope Completion Rate:** Percentage of deliverables completed per the WBS.  
- **Change Request Frequency:** Number of scope changes requested and approved.  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Feedback from stakeholders on deliverables.  

### Reporting  
Scope performance will be reported weekly to stakeholders via formal progress reports.  

---

## 10. Glossary  

- **Scope Creep:** The uncontrolled expansion of project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources.  
- **Scope Baseline:** Approved project scope, WBS, and WBS dictionary.  
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Standards by which deliverables are evaluated.  

---

## 11. Conclusion  

The Scope Management Plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent project defines the processes and tools required to manage scope effectively, ensuring alignment with stakeholder expectations and PMBOK standards. This plan will be revisited regularly and updated as needed to reflect changes in project requirements or priorities.
