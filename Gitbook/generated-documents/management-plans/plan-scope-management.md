## Plan Scope Management for Requirements Gathering Agent

This Plan Scope Management document outlines the approach for managing the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.  The plan considers the project's unique characteristics, including its AI-powered nature and the extensive documentation already available.

**1. Project Scope Statement:**

The RGA project aims to develop and deliver a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from various project sources, including but not limited to README.md files. The tool will support multiple AI providers, offer extensive validation and quality assurance features, and include a built-in version control system.

**2. Scope Baseline:**

The scope baseline will be established after the completion of the following:

* **Requirements Gathering:**  A thorough review of the existing project documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) will be conducted to confirm and refine existing requirements and identify any gaps.  Stakeholder input (developers, PMs, users) will be crucial in this phase.  This will result in a finalized Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM).
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** A detailed WBS will be created, decomposing the project into manageable work packages.  This will include tasks for development, testing, documentation, and deployment.
* **Scope Statement Approval:** The finalized scope statement, including the RTM and WBS, will be formally approved by relevant stakeholders. This approved document will serve as the scope baseline.

**3. Scope Verification:**

* **Inspection and Audits:** Regular inspections and audits of the deliverables against the scope baseline will be performed throughout the project lifecycle.  This will involve comparing actual deliverables to the planned deliverables defined in the WBS.
* **Formal Acceptance:** Upon completion of each major deliverable (e.g., core functionality, AI provider integration, VCS integration), a formal acceptance process will be implemented to verify its compliance with the scope baseline.  This will include testing and sign-off by stakeholders.
* **Formal Sign-off:** Final sign-off will occur only after successful completion of all deliverables, testing, and validation against the scope baseline.

**4. Scope Control:**

* **Change Management Process:** A formal change management process will be established to manage any requests for changes to the project scope.  This process will include a Change Request form, impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis, and approval by the Change Control Board (CCB).
* **Regular Monitoring:** The project manager will regularly monitor the project's progress and identify any potential scope creep.  This monitoring will involve tracking actual work against the planned work in the WBS and comparing progress against the project schedule.
* **Variance Analysis:**  Regular variance analysis will be conducted to identify any deviations from the scope baseline and take corrective action as needed.

**5. Tools and Techniques:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):** Used to link requirements to deliverables and ensure that all requirements are addressed.
* **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Used to decompose the project into manageable work packages.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):** Responsible for reviewing and approving change requests.
* **Project Management Software:**  A project management tool (e.g., Jira, Asana) will be used to track progress, manage tasks, and facilitate communication.
* **Version Control System (Git):**  Used for managing code changes and tracking the evolution of the RGA tool.

**6. Roles and Responsibilities:**

* **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall scope management, including planning, monitoring, and controlling.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for developing and testing the RGA tool.
* **Stakeholders:** Responsible for providing input and approving the scope baseline and change requests.
* **Change Control Board (CCB):** Responsible for reviewing and approving change requests.

**7.  Risk Management Related to Scope:**

* **Scope Creep:**  The risk of adding new features or requirements after the scope baseline is established. Mitigation:  Strict adherence to the change management process.
* **Requirements Volatility:** The risk of changes to the requirements during the project lifecycle. Mitigation:  Regular stakeholder communication and feedback loops.
* **Incomplete Requirements:** The risk of missing or incomplete requirements. Mitigation: Thorough requirements gathering and validation.

**8.  Metrics:**

* **Scope Change Requests:** Number of change requests submitted and approved.
* **Scope Variance:** Difference between planned and actual scope.
* **Time Spent on Change Management:** Time spent on processing and implementing change requests.
* **Cost of Changes:** Cost associated with implementing scope changes.


This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect any changes in the project environment or requirements. The project manager will be responsible for ensuring that the scope is managed effectively and that all deliverables are completed within the approved scope.  The existing documentation, particularly the README and associated files, provides a strong foundation for establishing the initial scope baseline, minimizing the effort required for initial scope definition.
