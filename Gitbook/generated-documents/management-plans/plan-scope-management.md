# Scope Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent  
### Project Context: PMBOK-Compliant AI-Driven Documentation Generator  

## 1. Introduction  
This **Scope Management Plan** outlines the processes for defining, developing, validating, and controlling the scope of the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project. The plan ensures that the project includes only the work required to achieve its objectives while adhering to PMBOK standards. It leverages iterative stakeholder engagement, formal documentation processes, and tools like the Requirements Gathering Agent itself to ensure alignment with stakeholder expectations and organizational policies.  

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach  
The scope will be managed through a formalized process that includes requirements elicitation, scope definition, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) development, scope validation, and scope control. Stakeholders and project managers will collaborate to prevent scope creep and ensure traceability from requirements to deliverables.  

### 2.1 Governance Framework  
- **PMBOK Methodology**: Ensure all scope management activities align with the PMBOK framework.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct iterative reviews to validate scope definition and control processes.  
- **Scope Compliance Tools**: Utilize the Requirements Gathering Agent to generate validated PMBOK-compliant documents.  

---

## 3. Scope Definition  

### 3.1 Inputs  
The following inputs will be used to define the project scope:  
- **Project Charter**: High-level scope, objectives, constraints, and assumptions.  
- **Stakeholder Register**: Identification of stakeholder needs and expectations.  
- **Requirements Documentation**: Functional and non-functional requirements derived from stakeholder analysis.  
- **Organizational Process Assets**: Templates, lessons learned, and historical data.  
- **Enterprise Environmental Factors**: Industry standards, compliance requirements, and best practices.  

### 3.2 Activities  
- **Requirements Gathering**: Conduct workshops and interviews with stakeholders to collect detailed needs.  
- **Scope Boundary Definition**: Clearly document what is in scope and out of scope to avoid ambiguity.  
- **Deliverable Breakdown**: Develop a comprehensive list of project deliverables using the WBS.  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define measurable criteria for deliverable acceptance to ensure alignment with PMBOK compliance.  

### 3.3 Outputs  
- **Scope Statement**: A detailed document outlining the project scope, boundaries, deliverables, constraints, and assumptions.  
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: A hierarchical decomposition of project work.  
- **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed descriptions of each work package in the WBS.  
- **Acceptance Criteria Document**: A formalized list of acceptance criteria for all deliverables.  

---

## 4. Scope Validation  

### 4.1 Validation Process  
- **Stakeholder Reviews**: Conduct formal reviews of scope documentation with key stakeholders (e.g., Project Managers, Business Analysts, Compliance Officers).  
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix**: Use a traceability matrix to ensure all requirements are mapped to specific deliverables.  
- **Scope Baseline Approval**: Obtain formal sign-off from stakeholders on the scope baseline, including the scope statement, WBS, and acceptance criteria.  

### 4.2 Tools and Techniques  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent**: Use the AI-driven tool to validate scope documentation against PMBOK standards.  
- **Document Reviews**: Iterative reviews of scope-related documents to ensure accuracy and completeness.  

---

## 5. Scope Control  

### 5.1 Change Control Process  
Scope changes will be managed through a structured change control process:  
1. **Change Request Submission**: All changes must be documented and submitted as formal change requests.  
2. **Impact Analysis**: Analyze the impact of the proposed changes on project objectives, schedule, budget, and quality.  
3. **Change Approval**: Changes will require approval from the Change Control Board (CCB) before implementation.  
4. **Scope Baseline Update**: Approved changes will be incorporated into the scope baseline and communicated to all stakeholders.  

### 5.2 Monitoring and Reporting  
- **Performance Metrics**: Use earned value management (EVM) to track scope performance against the baseline.  
- **Regular Status Updates**: Provide scope-related updates in weekly project status meetings.  
- **Scope Audit**: Conduct periodic audits of deliverables to ensure alignment with the scope baseline.  

---

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities  

### Project Manager:  
- Ensure scope management processes are implemented effectively.  
- Facilitate stakeholder engagement during scope definition and validation.  
- Monitor scope performance and report deviations to the CCB.  

### Stakeholders:  
- Provide input during requirements gathering and scope validation.  
- Review and approve scope documentation and deliverables.  

### Change Control Board (CCB):  
- Evaluate and approve scope change requests.  
- Ensure all changes align with project objectives and constraints.  

---

## 7. Tools and Techniques  

### Tools:  
- **Requirements Gathering Agent**: AI-powered tool for generating PMBOK-compliant scope documentation.  
- **Microsoft Project/Primavera P6**: For WBS creation and scope tracking.  
- **Jira/Confluence**: For managing scope-related artifacts and collaboration.  

### Techniques:  
- **Expert Judgment**: Leverage the expertise of project managers and business analysts during scope definition.  
- **Facilitation Workshops**: Conduct workshops to gather requirements and validate scope.  
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Refine scope iteratively based on stakeholder feedback.  

---

## 8. Scope Baseline  

The scope baseline will consist of:  
1. **Scope Statement**: A formal document defining the project scope.  
2. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: A hierarchical decomposition of project work.  
3. **WBS Dictionary**: Detailed descriptions of each work package.  

---

## 9. Performance Metrics  

Key metrics for scope management will include:  
- **Scope Variance**: Measure deviations from the approved scope baseline.  
- **Change Request Ratio**: Track the number of approved changes relative to total requests.  
- **Deliverable Acceptance Rate**: Monitor the percentage of deliverables approved by stakeholders.  

---

## 10. Assumptions and Constraints  

### Assumptions:  
- Stakeholders will actively participate in scope definition and validation processes.  
- The Requirements Gathering Agent will provide accurate and PMBOK-compliant documentation.  

### Constraints:  
- All scope changes must be approved by the CCB.  
- Documentation must adhere to PMBOK standards and organizational policies.

## 11. Conclusion  

This **Scope Management Plan** establishes a comprehensive framework for managing the project scope of the **Requirements Gathering Agent**. By adhering to PMBOK standards and leveraging AI-driven tools, the project team ensures that all work aligns with stakeholder expectations and project objectives while minimizing scope-related risks.
