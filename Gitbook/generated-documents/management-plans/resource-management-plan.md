# Resource Management Plan

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This Resource Management Plan outlines the approach for identifying, acquiring, managing, and utilizing resources required for the successful completion of the ADPA project.  Given the project's unique reliance on AI and its self-managing capabilities, this plan emphasizes efficient resource allocation and monitoring of AI-related resource consumption (API calls, compute time, etc.).

**2. Resource Identification**

The ADPA project requires the following resources:

* **Human Resources:**
    * **Project Manager:** Responsible for overall project planning, execution, and monitoring.
    * **Software Developers (2):**  Experienced in TypeScript, Node.js, and API integration. One developer will focus on core functionality and AI integration; the other will specialize in the CLI and user interface.
    * **AI/ML Engineer (1):** Expertise in large language models, prompt engineering, and AI model optimization.  This role is crucial for fine-tuning the AI models and optimizing the context management system.
    * **QA/Testing Engineer (1):** Responsible for designing and executing test plans to ensure the quality and reliability of the generated documents. Focus on PMBOK compliance validation.
    * **Technical Writer (1):** To create and maintain comprehensive documentation (including this Resource Management Plan).

* **Material Resources:**
    * **Azure OpenAI Service Subscription:** Access to GPT-4 and other relevant models.  Monitoring of API usage and cost will be a key aspect of resource management.
    * **Google AI Platform Subscription (Optional):** Access to Gemini models for comparison and potential future integration. Similar resource monitoring is required.
    * **GitHub Copilot Subscription (Optional):** For code generation assistance.
    * **Ollama (Local) Setup (Optional):** Local LLM deployment for testing and experimentation.
    * **Development Tools:**  Standard software development tools (IDEs, version control systems, etc.).


* **AI/Computational Resources:**
    * **API Call Limits:**  Careful monitoring and management of API call quotas for each AI provider to prevent exceeding limits and incurring unexpected costs.
    * **Compute Resources:** Tracking of compute time used by the AI models for document generation, ensuring efficient resource allocation and cost optimization.
    * **Data Storage:**  Management of the knowledge base and generated documents, ensuring sufficient storage capacity.


**3. Resource Acquisition**

* **Human Resources:** Internal recruitment or external contracting, depending on availability and project needs.  A clear recruitment strategy and budget will be defined.
* **Material Resources:**  Subscriptions will be acquired based on the project's needs and budget.  Negotiation of favorable pricing and contract terms is a priority.  Free tiers of AI services will be utilized where possible initially.

**4. Resource Allocation**

Resource allocation will be based on the project schedule, task dependencies, and individual skillsets.  A detailed resource assignment matrix will be maintained, tracking assigned tasks and resource availability.  The Project Manager will actively monitor resource utilization and make adjustments as needed.

**5. Resource Leveling**

Given the inherent parallelism in AI processing, resource leveling will focus on optimizing the use of AI resources.  This involves:

* **Batch Processing:**  Processing multiple documents concurrently to maximize API usage efficiency.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Implementing asynchronous operations wherever possible to minimize latency and improve overall efficiency.
* **AI Model Selection:**  Choosing the most appropriate AI model based on the task's requirements and cost-effectiveness.


**6. Resource Monitoring and Control**

* **Regular Reporting:**  Weekly progress reports will include resource utilization metrics (API calls, compute time, cost).
* **Budget Tracking:**  Regular monitoring of budget expenditure against planned costs.
* **Risk Management:**  Identification and mitigation of risks related to resource availability, performance, and cost.
* **Performance Evaluation:**  Regular performance evaluation of AI models and resource consumption to identify optimization opportunities.


**7. Resource Release**

Upon project completion, all resources will be released, including cancelling subscriptions and archiving relevant data.  A detailed plan for resource release will be developed and implemented.

**8. Communication Plan**

Regular communication will be maintained among team members to ensure efficient resource coordination.  This will include weekly meetings, progress reports, and prompt communication of any resource-related issues.  A communication matrix will be established.

**9. Risk Management**

Potential risks related to resource management include:

* **API Cost Overruns:**  Exceeding API call limits or unexpected cost increases from AI providers. Mitigation:  Establish clear API usage limits, monitor usage closely, explore cost-saving strategies.
* **AI Model Performance:**  Unexpected degradation in AI model performance affecting document quality. Mitigation:  Implement robust monitoring and fallback mechanisms.
* **Resource Availability:**  Lack of availability of required human resources. Mitigation:  Proactive recruitment and clear contingency plans.


**10.  AI Resource Optimization Strategies**

* **Prompt Engineering:**  Refining prompts to minimize token usage and improve AI response accuracy.
* **Context Optimization:**  Efficiently managing the context provided to the AI models to maximize performance and minimize cost.
* **Model Selection:**  Choosing the most cost-effective AI model for each task.
* **Caching:**  Implementing caching mechanisms to reduce redundant API calls.


This Resource Management Plan will be reviewed and updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes in project scope, resource availability, and performance.  The Project Manager is responsible for ensuring the effective implementation of this plan.
