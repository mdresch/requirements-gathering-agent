# Resource Management Plan  
*Project: Requirements Gathering Agent*  
*Version: 1.0*  
*Date: 2024-06-15*  
*Prepared by: Project Manager*

## 1. Introduction  
The Resource Management Plan defines the approach for identifying, acquiring, managing, and controlling resources required for the successful delivery of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. This plan aligns with PMBOK guidelines and ensures optimal utilization of human, physical, and organizational resources throughout the project lifecycle.

## 3. Resource Acquisition  

- **Human Resources** will be acquired through internal staffing and, if needed, external contractors (especially for specialized AI/ML roles).  
- **Technical Resources** will be provisioned via Azure subscriptions and authorized software procurement channels.  
- **Physical Resources** such as workstations will be assigned from existing company inventory or procured if necessary.

## 5. Resource Management Approach  

- **Resource Scheduling:** Resources will be assigned according to the project schedule in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). The Project Manager will maintain a resource calendar to avoid conflicts and ensure availability.  
- **Resource Allocation:** Priority is given to critical tasks and milestones. Agile sprints will be used for iterative development, with resource adjustments as needed.  
- **Resource Optimization:** Cross-training and knowledge sharing will be encouraged to increase flexibility.  
- **Resource Monitoring:** Regular status meetings and resource utilization reports will be conducted to track progress and identify shortages or bottlenecks.  
- **Conflict Resolution:** The Project Manager will mediate resource conflicts, escalating to PMO or sponsors if necessary.  

---

## 6. Training and Development  

- Team members will undergo orientation on project goals, tools (Azure OpenAI, Node.js environment), and PMBOK standards.  
- Specialized AI/ML training sessions will be scheduled for developers new to GPT-4 and Azure OpenAI integration.  
- Continuous learning encouraged through knowledge sharing sessions and access to online courses.  

---

## 7. Resource Control  

- **Performance Metrics:** Utilization rates, task completion rates, defect rates (QA), and documentation quality will be tracked.  
- **Change Management:** Any changes in resource requirements must be approved via the Change Control Board (CCB).  
- **Resource Reallocation:** Based on project needs, resources may be reassigned or increased/decreased with appropriate approvals.  
- **Issue Management:** Resource-related issues (availability, skill gaps) will be logged and addressed promptly.  

---

## 8. Tools and Techniques  

- **Resource Management Software:** Microsoft Project, Azure DevOps Boards for task and resource tracking.  
- **Communication Tools:** Microsoft Teams, Email, and scheduled video conferences.  
- **Documentation:** Centralized repository in GitHub and project SharePoint for resource plans and updates.

## 9. Resource Risks and Mitigation  

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |  
|-------|--------|---------------------|  
| Resource unavailability | High | Early identification, backup resources, flexible scheduling |  
| Skill gaps | Medium | Training, hiring contractors, mentoring |  
| Over-allocation | Medium | Monitor workload, adjust assignments, prioritize tasks |  
| Technology changes | Low | Continuous learning, proactive R&D |
