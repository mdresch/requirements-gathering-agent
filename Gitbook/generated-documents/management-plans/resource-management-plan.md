## 5. Resource Management Processes

### 5.1 Resource Planning

- Resources will be identified during the initial project planning and requirements gathering phases.
- Resource requirements will be reviewed and updated regularly during planning and execution.
- The plan will be aligned with the project schedule and budget constraints.

### 5.2 Resource Acquisition

- Human resources will be allocated based on skillset fit, availability, and project priorities.
- Procurement of physical resources and cloud services will follow organizational procurement policies.
- AI provider credentials and access rights will be managed securely, with role-based access control via Azure Entra ID.

### 5.3 Resource Development

- Cross-training will be encouraged to mitigate single points of failure.

### 5.4 Resource Monitoring and Control

- Resource usage and performance will be monitored against the baseline.
- Timesheets and utilization reports will be used to track human resource allocation.
- Cloud resource usage and costs will be tracked to avoid overruns.
- Issues or conflicts regarding resource availability will be escalated to the Project Manager.

---

## 6. Resource Availability and Constraints

- AI/ML Engineers and Software Developers must have access to high-performance computing resources and appropriate AI model licenses.
- Local AI development (Ollama) requires dedicated infrastructure setup and availability.
- Azure Entra ID authentication requires coordination with the enterprise IT security team; delays in access provisioning could impact schedule.
- Some roles may be shared with other projects; resource leveling and prioritization will be applied as needed.
