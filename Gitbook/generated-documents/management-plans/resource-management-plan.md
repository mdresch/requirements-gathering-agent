2. **External Hiring**: Partner with recruitment agencies for specialized roles.  
3. **Vendor Collaboration**: Use third-party consultants for AI optimization.  

### Physical Resources  
Key physical resources include cloud computing infrastructure and development tools. These will be sourced as follows:  
- **Cloud Resources**: Azure OpenAI and Google AI instances will be provisioned via organizational accounts.  
- **Development Tools**: Node.js, TypeScript, Jest, and associated libraries will be installed via the organization’s package management system.
