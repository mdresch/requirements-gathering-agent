### **Challenges Encountered**
1. **Zero Tokens in Context for Some Documents**  
   - **Resolution:** Enhanced logic to ensure all discovered markdown files are added to the context manager before generation.

2. **CLI Permission Denied**  
   - **Resolution:** Fixed CLI build and configuration issues to ensure executable compatibility.

3. **Large Model Context Utilization**  
   - **Resolution:** Improved context allocation logic for large models, ensuring up to 90% token utilization.
