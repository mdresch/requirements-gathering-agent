# Key Roles and Needs Analysis

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the key roles involved in the ADPA project and their associated needs.  The analysis is based on the project's stated goals, the complexity of the AI-powered system, and the diverse user base anticipated.

**I. Key Roles:**

A. **Development Team:**

* **Lead Developer:**  Responsible for overall architecture, code quality, and team management.  Needs strong TypeScript, Node.js, and AI API integration skills, experience with large-scale projects, and excellent communication abilities.
* **AI/ML Engineer:**  Focuses on AI model integration, context management optimization, and performance tuning. Needs expertise in large language models (LLMs), prompt engineering, and model selection strategies.  Familiarity with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, and potentially other providers is crucial.
* **Backend Developer:**  Develops and maintains the core application logic, database interactions (if applicable), and API endpoints. Requires proficiency in Node.js, TypeScript, and relevant database technologies.
* **Frontend Developer (if applicable):**  Develops any user interfaces (e.g., a web dashboard for configuration or monitoring).  Needs experience with relevant frontend frameworks and UI/UX design principles.  This role might be less crucial given the CLI focus, but could be valuable for future enhancements.
* **DevOps Engineer:**  Manages the CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure, and deployment processes.  Needs expertise in containerization (Docker), cloud platforms (Azure preferred), and automated testing frameworks.
* **QA/Test Engineer:**  Develops and executes test plans, ensuring code quality and functionality. Needs experience in automated testing, unit testing, integration testing, and PMBOK compliance validation.

B. **Product/Project Management:**

* **Product Manager:** Defines the product vision, roadmap, and prioritizes features. Needs a strong understanding of the project management domain, market needs, and AI capabilities.  Must be able to translate business needs into technical specifications.
* **Project Manager:** Oversees the project execution, tracks progress, manages risks, and ensures timely delivery.  Needs strong PMBOK knowledge and experience managing complex software projects.

C. **Stakeholders:**

* **Project Managers:**  The primary users of ADPA.  Need a user-friendly interface, accurate and compliant document generation, and efficient workflows.  Feedback on usability and feature requests is crucial.
* **Business Analysts:**  Users who require the tool for requirements gathering and analysis.  Need robust integration with existing tools and processes.
* **Executive Management:**  Require high-level reports on project progress and ROI.  Need executive-ready documentation and clear communication of progress and value.
