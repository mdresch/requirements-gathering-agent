## Security Testing Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Security Testing Overview**

**1.1 Objectives and Goals:**  The primary objective of this security testing plan is to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities within the ADPA application and its associated infrastructure. This includes validating the security of its data handling practices, authentication mechanisms, and overall resilience against common attack vectors.  The goal is to ensure ADPA meets industry best practices and relevant compliance standards before deployment.

**1.2 Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**

* **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive project data (e.g., client information, internal documents, API keys) stored within the application or during transit.  This is a high-priority risk due to the nature of the application dealing with potentially confidential project information.
* **Injection Attacks:** Vulnerability to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection, and other injection attacks, particularly through user input or API interactions.
* **Authentication Bypass:**  Compromise of authentication mechanisms used for accessing the application (API keys, OAuth 2.0 flows).
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attacks aimed at rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.
* **API Security:**  Weaknesses in the API endpoints used for communication with external services (e.g., AI providers).  Improper authorization or input validation could lead to data breaches or service disruptions.
* **Data Integrity:**  Compromise of the integrity of generated documents, potentially leading to the insertion of malicious content.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by authorized personnel.
* **Third-Party Risks:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).

**1.3 Compliance Requirements and Standards:**

* **OWASP Top 10:** Adherence to the latest OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's five functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
* **GDPR (if applicable):** Compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation if ADPA handles personal data.
* **HIPAA (if applicable):** Compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act if ADPA handles protected health information.
* **PCI DSS (if applicable):** Compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard if ADPA handles payment card data.
* **SOX (if applicable):** Compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act if ADPA handles financial data.

**1.4 Security Testing Scope and Limitations:**

This plan covers the ADPA application itself, its associated APIs, and the deployment infrastructure.  It does *not* cover the security of the underlying AI providers (Azure OpenAI, etc.) which are assumed to be secure.  Testing will be limited to the publicly accessible components of the system unless specific internal components are explicitly included in the scope.  The testing will not include physical security assessments.


**2. Security Test Strategy**

This plan employs a multi-layered approach encompassing various security testing methodologies:

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Analyze source code for vulnerabilities before runtime.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Test the running application for vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Simulate real-world attacks to assess the application's resilience.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual inspection of critical code sections by security experts.
* **Configuration Testing:** Verify secure configurations of servers, databases, and network devices.
* **Vulnerability Scanning:** Automated scans to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **Social Engineering (limited):**  Assess the susceptibility of users to phishing or other social engineering attacks (scope limited to simulated scenarios, not actual attacks against real personnel).


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies (Detailed)**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Using automated tools (Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys) to scan for known vulnerabilities in the application and infrastructure.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing by security experts to attempt to exploit identified vulnerabilities and assess the impact.  This includes black box, grey box, and potentially white box testing depending on the access granted.
* **Security Code Review:**  Expert review of critical code sections focusing on authentication, authorization, input validation, and data handling.
* **Configuration Testing:**  Review of server, database, and network device configurations for compliance with security best practices and hardening guidelines. This will include checking for default passwords, unnecessary services, and weak encryption settings.
* **Compliance Testing:** Verification of adherence to relevant standards (OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, GDPR, HIPAA, etc.) using both automated tools and manual review.
* **Social Engineering Testing (Simulated):**  Conducting simulated phishing campaigns to evaluate the effectiveness of security awareness training and the resilience of users to social engineering attacks.


**4. Security Test Scenarios (Detailed)**

* **Authentication Attacks:**
    * Brute-force attacks against authentication credentials.
    * Credential stuffing attacks using leaked credentials from other websites.
    * Session hijacking attempts.
* **Authorization Bypass:**
    * Attempts to escalate privileges to access unauthorized resources.
    * Circumvention of access control mechanisms.
* **Injection Attacks:**
    * SQL injection attacks targeting database queries.
    * Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to inject malicious JavaScript code.
    * Command injection attacks to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    * LDAP injection attacks.
* **Data Exposure:**
    * Attempts to access sensitive data (API keys, user data, project data) through various means.
    * Testing for insecure storage of sensitive data (e.g., plain text passwords, unencrypted API keys).
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    * HTTP flood attacks.
    * Application-layer attacks.
* **Cryptographic Failures:**
    * Analysis of encryption algorithms and key management practices.
    * Testing for weaknesses in encryption implementations.
* **API Security Tests:**
    * Testing for insecure API endpoints, lack of input validation, and insufficient authorization.
    * Attempts to manipulate API responses to gain unauthorized access or modify data.


**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, OWASP ZAP
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
* **Compliance Scanners:**  Tools specific to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, etc. (selection depends on applicable regulations)


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated, isolated security testing environment will be created, mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.  This environment will include separate test databases, network segmentation, and monitoring tools to capture testing activities.  Test data will be anonymized or synthetic to protect sensitive information.


**7. Security Test Execution**

* **Timeline:**  A detailed timeline will be established outlining the phases of testing (vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, code review, etc.) and their expected durations.
* **Reporting:**  Regular reports will be generated documenting the findings, vulnerabilities identified, and their severity.  These reports will include remediation recommendations.
* **Remediation:**  A clear process will be defined for tracking the remediation of identified vulnerabilities.  Remediation efforts will be validated through retesting.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards (Detailed)**

The testing will specifically address compliance with the standards mentioned earlier (OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and any applicable regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, or SOX).  Compliance will be verified through automated scans, manual review, and penetration testing results.  Audit trails will be maintained to document the compliance efforts.

**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

Key metrics will include:

* Number of vulnerabilities identified by severity level (critical, high, medium, low).
* Time taken to remediate vulnerabilities.
* Percentage of vulnerabilities remediated.
* Overall security score based on identified vulnerabilities and remediation efforts.
* Test coverage (percentage of application components tested).

Reports will be generated for technical teams and management, providing a clear picture of the application's security posture.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

A prioritized list of vulnerabilities will be created, with remediation timelines established based on severity.  Security controls will be implemented to address the identified weaknesses.  Continuous security monitoring will be implemented post-deployment to identify and address any emerging vulnerabilities.  Security awareness training for developers and users will be recommended.


**Specific Considerations for ADPA:**

Given ADPA's reliance on external AI providers, security testing should focus heavily on:

* **Secure API Integration:**  Verify that API keys and other credentials are handled securely and are not exposed in the application code or logs.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly test the input validation mechanisms to prevent injection attacks.
* **Data Handling:**  Ensure that sensitive data is handled according to best practices, including encryption at rest and in transit.
* **Output Validation:**  Validate the output of the AI models to ensure that no malicious content is included in the generated documents.  Implement mechanisms to detect and prevent the inclusion of harmful content.
* **Access Control:**  Implement robust access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to the application and its data.  This includes appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms for API access.

This detailed plan provides a comprehensive framework for security testing ADPA.  The specific tools and methodologies used may need to be adjusted based on the available resources and the evolving threat landscape.  Regular reviews and updates to this plan are crucial to maintain the security of the application.
