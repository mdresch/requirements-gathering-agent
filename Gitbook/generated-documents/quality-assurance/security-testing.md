## Security Testing Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

This document outlines a comprehensive security testing plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA RGA) project, addressing the unique security considerations of an API-first system handling sensitive enterprise data and integrating with multiple AI providers.

**1. Security Testing Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:** To identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities in the ADPA RGA, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and system functionality.  This includes validating compliance with relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX, if applicable, based on client data handled) and industry best practices (OWASP Top 10, NIST Cybersecurity Framework).

* **Security Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling:**  The ADPA RGA faces risks associated with:
    * **Data breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive enterprise data (financial, personal, etc.) used for generating documents.
    * **API vulnerabilities:** Injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection), broken authentication, authorization bypass, insecure data handling.
    * **Third-party risks:** Vulnerabilities in integrated AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) and their impact on the ADPA RGA.
    * **Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks:** Overwhelming the API with requests, rendering it unavailable.
    * **Supply chain attacks:** Compromised dependencies used in the ADPA RGA.
    * **Insider threats:** Malicious or negligent actions by authorized personnel.

* **Compliance Requirements and Standards:** The testing will validate compliance with:
    * **GDPR:** If the system processes personal data of EU citizens.
    * **HIPAA:** If the system handles protected health information (PHI).
    * **PCI DSS:** If the system processes payment card data.
    * **SOX:** If the system handles financial data subject to Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulations.
    * **OWASP Top 10:**  Addressing the most critical web application security risks.
    * **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**  Aligning with the framework's core functions.

* **Security Testing Scope and Limitations:** This plan covers the API, CLI, and any exposed components.  Out-of-scope elements include the internal infrastructure of the AI providers and client-side applications interacting with the API (unless specifically requested).  Testing will be performed within the constraints of the provided testing environment.


**2. Security Test Strategy**

The testing strategy employs a multi-layered approach combining automated and manual techniques:

* **Authentication Testing:** Verify API key validation, JWT handling, and session management robustness against brute-force attacks, replay attacks, and session hijacking.
* **Authorization Testing:** Validate access control mechanisms to ensure proper permission levels are enforced for different users and roles.  Test for privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
* **Input Validation Testing:** Thoroughly test all input parameters for various injection attacks (SQL, XSS, command injection, LDAP injection) and other malicious input.  Utilize fuzzing techniques where appropriate.
* **Data Protection Testing:** Verify data encryption (at rest and in transit), data integrity checks, and adherence to data privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).  Assess the security of data storage mechanisms.
* **Network Security Testing:** Analyze network communication security, including TLS/SSL configuration and potential vulnerabilities in network protocols used by the API.
* **Application Security Testing:**  Identify security weaknesses in the application code through static and dynamic analysis.


**3. Security Test Types and Methodologies**

* **Vulnerability Assessment:** Automated scanning using tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, and OWASP ZAP to identify known vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual testing to simulate real-world attacks, exploiting identified vulnerabilities and attempting to gain unauthorized access or privilege escalation.  This will include black-box, grey-box, and potentially white-box testing depending on the project's needs and access level.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual inspection of the source code to identify potential security flaws.  Automated static analysis tools like SonarQube, Checkmarx, and Veracode will be integrated.
* **Configuration Testing:** Verify the security of server configurations (e.g., OS hardening, database security, web server settings), API gateways, and network devices.
* **Compliance Testing:**  Utilize specialized tools to validate compliance with relevant regulations and standards (e.g., PCI DSS compliance scanner).
* **Social Engineering Testing:**  (Optional, depending on project requirements) Simulate phishing attacks and other social engineering techniques to assess the human element of security.


**4. Security Test Scenarios**

* **Authentication Attacks:** Brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, session hijacking, replay attacks, weak password checks.
* **Authorization Bypass:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, insecure direct object references (IDOR).
* **Injection Attacks:** SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), command injection, LDAP injection, XML External Entities (XXE).
* **Data Exposure:** Sensitive data leakage (e.g., API keys, user credentials, personally identifiable information), insecure storage of sensitive data.
* **Denial of Service:**  Application-layer DoS attacks, resource exhaustion attacks.
* **Cryptographic Failures:** Weak encryption algorithms, improper key management, insecure random number generation.
* **API Specific Attacks:** Broken object level authorization, mass assignment, insecure deserialization.
* **Third-Party API Attacks:**  Assess the security of the interaction with third-party AI APIs and identify potential vulnerabilities in data exchange.


**5. Security Testing Tools and Technologies**

* **Vulnerability Scanners:** Nessus, OpenVAS, QualysGuard, OWASP ZAP.
* **Penetration Testing Tools:** Metasploit Framework, Burp Suite, Nmap, Wireshark.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode.
* **Dynamic Analysis Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
* **Compliance Scanners:** Tools specific to GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOX compliance.


**6. Security Test Environment**

A dedicated, isolated testing environment mirroring the production environment will be created. This includes:

* **Network Segmentation:** Isolating the testing environment from the production network.
* **Test Data:**  Using anonymized or synthetic data to protect real sensitive information.
* **Monitoring and Logging:**  Comprehensive logging and monitoring of all testing activities.


**7. Security Test Execution**

* **Timeline:** The testing timeline will be defined based on the project's schedule and scope.  A phased approach might be adopted, starting with vulnerability assessments, followed by penetration testing, and finally, code review and compliance checks.
* **Vulnerability Classification:**  Identified vulnerabilities will be classified based on severity (critical, high, medium, low) and risk to the system.
* **Incident Response:**  A well-defined incident response plan will be in place to handle any security incidents during testing.
* **Remediation Tracking:**  A system for tracking and validating the remediation of identified vulnerabilities.


**8. Security Compliance and Standards**

The testing will explicitly address compliance with all applicable regulations and standards mentioned in Section 1.  This will involve both technical testing and documentation review.


**9. Security Metrics and Reporting**

* **Vulnerability Metrics:** Number of vulnerabilities identified, categorized by severity and type.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Analysis of the potential impact of each vulnerability.
* **Test Coverage:**  Percentage of the application codebase and functionalities tested.
* **Reporting:**  Regular progress reports and a final security assessment report summarizing findings and recommendations.


**10. Security Improvement and Remediation**

* **Prioritization:**  Vulnerabilities will be prioritized based on severity and risk.
* **Remediation Plan:** A detailed plan outlining how each vulnerability will be addressed.
* **Validation:**  Retesting after remediation to ensure vulnerabilities have been successfully fixed.
* **Continuous Monitoring:**  Recommendations for ongoing security monitoring and improvement.


This plan provides a framework. Specific details, such as the exact timeline, tools, and test cases, will be refined during the planning phase based on a more detailed understanding of the system architecture and data flow.  The plan will be iteratively updated throughout the testing process.
