## Technical Acceptance Criteria: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

This document outlines the technical acceptance criteria for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project.  Criteria are categorized for clarity and testability.  Each criterion includes validation methods, test scenarios, success metrics, failure conditions, and acceptance thresholds.

**Note:**  Due to the complexity and scope of ADPA, this document provides a sample of acceptance criteria.  A complete set would require a far more extensive document covering all features and functionalities in detail.  This example focuses on key aspects to illustrate the required level of detail.
