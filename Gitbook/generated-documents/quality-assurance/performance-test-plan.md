## Performance Test Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:**  To determine the performance characteristics of the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API under various load conditions, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that the system meets predefined performance requirements.  Specifically, we aim to determine the maximum concurrent users, transaction throughput, and response times for key API endpoints.  We also aim to assess the system's scalability and stability under sustained load.

* **Success Criteria and Performance Benchmarks:**  The system will be deemed successful if it meets the following benchmarks under peak load conditions:

    * **Response Time:**  Average response time for document generation (POST /api/v1/documents/convert) < 2 seconds; 95th percentile < 5 seconds.  Other API endpoints (GET requests) < 500ms average, 95th percentile < 1 second.
    * **Throughput:**  Minimum 100 document generation requests per minute under peak load.
    * **Resource Utilization:** CPU utilization < 80%, Memory utilization < 80%, Disk I/O < 70%, Network I/O < 70%.
    * **Error Rate:**  Error rate < 1%.
    * **Stability:**  No system crashes or significant performance degradation during endurance testing (24-hour run).

* **Testing Scope:** This plan covers performance testing of the core API endpoints: `/api/v1/documents/convert`, `/api/v1/documents/jobs`, `/api/v1/templates`, and `/api/v1/health`.  It includes load, stress, volume, spike, and endurance testing.

* **Limitations:**  Testing will be conducted in a simulated environment.  Results may vary in a production environment.  The testing scope does not include security vulnerability assessments.


**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:**  As defined in the Success Criteria above.

* **Throughput Requirements:** As defined in the Success Criteria above.

* **Resource Utilization Limits:** As defined in the Success Criteria above.

* **Scalability Targets:** The system should be able to handle a 10x increase in load within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., scaling up resources).

* **Availability Requirements:**  99.9% uptime.


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal expected user load to determine baseline performance and identify bottlenecks.

* **Stress Testing:** Gradually increase load beyond normal capacity to identify breaking points and system limitations.

* **Volume Testing:** Test the system's ability to handle large amounts of data (large input JSON for document generation).

* **Spike Testing:** Simulate sudden surges in user load to evaluate the system's responsiveness to unexpected traffic spikes.

* **Endurance Testing:** Run the system under sustained load for an extended period (24 hours) to detect memory leaks, performance degradation, and stability issues.

* **Capacity Testing:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent users and transactions the system can handle before performance degrades significantly.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment:**  A dedicated staging environment mirroring the production environment as closely as possible.  This includes similar hardware specifications, network configuration, and database setup.

* **Hardware and Software Requirements:**  The test environment should have sufficient resources to handle the expected load (details to be determined based on capacity planning). This may include multiple load generation machines.  Software requirements include the application under test, the chosen performance testing tool, and monitoring tools.

* **Network Configuration:**  A stable, high-bandwidth network connection is required.

* **Test Data:**  Realistic test data will be generated, including various sizes of input JSON files for document generation, representative of expected real-world scenarios (Fortune 500 company data structures). Data generation tools will be used to ensure data consistency and volume.

* **Environment Monitoring:**  System performance will be monitored using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or similar, capturing CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O, and application-specific metrics.


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:**
    1.  User authenticates, uploads a large JSON file, and receives the generated document.
    2.  User retrieves a list of jobs.
    3.  User retrieves the status of a specific job.
    4.  User retrieves a list of available templates.

* **Business Process Scenarios:**
    1.  Generating a BABOK v3 framework from a large dataset.
    2.  Generating multiple documents concurrently.

* **System Integration Scenarios:**
    1.  End-to-end testing from data upload to document retrieval.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:**  JMeter (recommended for its flexibility and open-source nature).  k6 is another strong contender for cloud-based testing and scripting capabilities.

* **Monitoring Tools:**  Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive system monitoring.  New Relic or Datadog are viable alternatives.

* **Data Analysis Tools:**  The performance testing tool's built-in reporting capabilities, supplemented by spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets) for deeper analysis.

* **Load Generation:**  JMeter's distributed load generation capabilities will be used to simulate a large number of concurrent users.

* **Test Automation:**  JMeter scripts will be developed and parameterized for automated test execution and reporting.


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:**  (To be defined based on project timeline, but should include phases for test environment setup, script development, load testing, stress testing, and reporting)

* **Resource Allocation:**  A dedicated performance testing team with expertise in JMeter and performance analysis.

* **Test Data Management:**  A data generation script will be created to populate the database with realistic test data.  Data cleanup procedures will be defined after each test run.

* **Result Collection:**  Performance metrics will be collected automatically by JMeter and monitoring tools.

* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system (Jira, Azure DevOps) will be used to track and manage identified performance issues.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**

* **Response Time Metrics:**  Average, median, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile response times for each API endpoint.

* **Throughput Metrics:**  Transactions per second (TPS), requests per minute (RPM) for each API endpoint.

* **System Resource Metrics:**  CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O, network I/O for the application server and database server.

* **Error Rate Metrics:**  Percentage of failed requests and types of errors encountered.

* **Availability Metrics:**  System uptime during endurance testing.


**9. Success Criteria and Acceptance Thresholds**

As defined in section 1,  Performance Test Overview - Success Criteria and Performance Benchmarks.


**10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

* **Performance Risks:**  Insufficient test environment resources, inaccurate test data, unexpected system behavior, delays in test environment setup.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  Provision adequate test environment resources, thorough test data validation, careful test planning, and contingency plans for delays.

* **Contingency Plans:**  If performance targets are not met, further investigation will be conducted to identify and address bottlenecks.  This may involve code optimization, infrastructure upgrades, or adjustments to the application design.

* **Performance Optimization:**  Profiling tools will be used to identify performance bottlenecks in the code.

* **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:**  The system will only be released if it meets the defined performance benchmarks and stability criteria.  A formal go/no-go decision will be made based on the test results and recommendations from the performance testing team.
