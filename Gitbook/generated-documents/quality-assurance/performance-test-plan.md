## Performance Test Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

**1. Performance Test Overview**

* **Objectives and Goals:**  To determine the performance characteristics of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) under various load conditions, identify performance bottlenecks, and validate that the system meets defined performance requirements.  This includes assessing response times, throughput, resource utilization, scalability, and stability.

* **Success Criteria and Benchmarks:** The RGA shall meet the following performance benchmarks under peak load conditions (defined in Section 2):
    * Average response time for document generation: < 5 seconds (95th percentile < 10 seconds)
    * Maximum concurrent users:  100 (with acceptable performance degradation)
    * CPU utilization: < 80%
    * Memory utilization: < 80%
    * Disk I/O utilization: < 70%
    * Network utilization: < 70%
    * Error rate: < 1%

* **Testing Scope:** This plan covers performance testing of the RGA's core functionalities, including document generation (various document types), context analysis, AI provider interaction, and CLI interaction.  The SharePoint and Confluence integrations will be tested separately.

* **Limitations:** This plan does not include testing of the underlying AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) or the network infrastructure outside of the RGA's control.  Security testing is outside the scope of this performance test plan.


**2. Performance Requirements**

* **Response Time Requirements:**
    * Document generation (all types):  < 5 seconds (95th percentile < 10 seconds)
    * CLI command execution: < 2 seconds
    * Context analysis: < 3 seconds

* **Throughput Requirements:**
    * Transactions per second (TPS): 10 TPS under normal load, 50 TPS under peak load.  A transaction is defined as a single document generation request.

* **Concurrent User Capacity:** 100 concurrent users under peak load.

* **Resource Utilization Limits:**  See success criteria above (80% CPU, 80% Memory, 70% Disk I/O, 70% Network).

* **Scalability Targets:** The system should be able to handle a 50% increase in load without significant performance degradation.

* **Availability Requirements:**  99.9% uptime during peak usage periods.


**3. Performance Test Types and Approach**

* **Load Testing:** Simulate normal expected load using a range of concurrent users.
* **Stress Testing:** Gradually increase the load beyond normal capacity to determine the breaking point.
* **Endurance Testing:** Run the system under sustained load for an extended period (e.g., 24 hours) to identify performance degradation over time.
* **Spike Testing:** Simulate sudden surges in user load to assess the system's responsiveness.
* **Volume Testing:** Test the system's ability to handle large amounts of input data (e.g., large project READMEs).
* **Capacity Testing:** Determine the maximum user load and data volume the system can handle before performance becomes unacceptable.


**4. Test Environment and Infrastructure**

* **Performance Test Environment:** A dedicated server environment mirroring the production environment as closely as possible. This includes the operating system, database, and application server.  Consider cloud-based infrastructure for scalability.

* **Hardware and Software Requirements:**
    * Dedicated server(s) with sufficient CPU, memory, and disk space.
    * Database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL)
    * Application server (Node.js)
    * Performance testing tools (see Section 6)
    * Monitoring tools (see Section 6)

* **Network Configuration:**  A high-bandwidth network connection with minimal latency.

* **Test Data:** A representative set of project READMEs and other relevant documents of varying sizes and complexity.  Data generation scripts should be created to simulate real-world scenarios.


**5. Performance Test Scenarios**

* **User Journey Scenarios:**
    * Scenario 1: Generate a complete PMBOK document suite from a standard README.
    * Scenario 2: Generate specific document types (e.g., only the project charter).
    * Scenario 3: Generate documents with different AI providers.
    * Scenario 4: Use CLI commands for various actions (generate, validate, etc.).

* **Business Process Scenarios:**
    * Scenario 5: Simulate a team of users generating documents concurrently.

* **System Integration Scenarios:**  (To be performed in separate test plans)
    * SharePoint integration testing.
    * Confluence integration testing.


**6. Test Tools and Technologies**

* **Performance Testing Tools:** JMeter, k6, LoadView.  JMeter is recommended for its flexibility and extensive features.

* **Monitoring Tools:**  New Relic, Datadog, Prometheus. These tools will monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, network utilization, and application performance metrics.

* **Data Analysis Tools:**  Grafana, Kibana.  These tools will be used to visualize and analyze performance data.

* **Load Generation:** JMeter's distributed testing capabilities will be utilized for generating high loads.

* **Test Automation:**  JMeter scripts will be developed to automate test execution and reporting.


**7. Test Execution Strategy**

* **Test Execution Schedule:**  A detailed schedule will be created outlining the specific tasks, timelines, and responsibilities for each phase of testing.  This will include load testing, stress testing, endurance testing, and spike testing.

* **Resource Allocation:** A dedicated performance testing team will be assembled with expertise in performance testing tools and methodologies.

* **Test Data Management:**  A robust test data management strategy will be implemented, including data generation, setup, cleanup, and version control.

* **Result Collection:** Performance metrics will be collected automatically using monitoring tools and performance testing tools.

* **Issue Management:**  A bug tracking system (e.g., Jira) will be used to track and manage identified performance issues.


**8. Performance Metrics and KPIs**

* **Response Time Metrics:** Average, median, 90th percentile, and 95th percentile response times for each scenario.

* **Throughput Metrics:** Transactions per second (TPS), requests per minute (RPM).

* **System Resource Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory utilization, disk I/O utilization, network utilization.

* **Error Rate Metrics:** Percentage of failed requests and types of errors.

* **Availability Metrics:** System uptime and downtime.


**9. Success Criteria and Acceptance Thresholds**

See Section 1 (Success Criteria and Benchmarks).  Any deviation from these benchmarks will be investigated and addressed.


**10. Risk Management and Contingency Planning**

* **Performance Risks:**  Insufficient server resources, network issues, unexpected load spikes, bugs in the application.

* **Risk Mitigation Strategies:**  Provision sufficient server resources, monitor network performance, implement load balancing, and thoroughly test the application before deployment.

* **Contingency Plans:**  If performance targets are not met, further investigation will be conducted to identify bottlenecks.  This may involve code optimization, infrastructure upgrades, or adjustments to the application architecture.

* **Performance Optimization:**  Strategies for performance improvement will be developed based on test results, including code optimization, database tuning, and caching strategies.

* **Go/No-Go Decision Criteria:**  The RGA will only be released to production if it meets the defined performance benchmarks.


This Performance Test Plan provides a framework for evaluating the performance of the Requirements Gathering Agent.  Specific details, such as the exact schedule and resource allocation, will be refined during the test planning phase.
