# Test Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the test strategy, approach, and execution plan for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) software.  It serves as a guide for the testing team and stakeholders, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage and a high-quality product release.

* **Scope:** This test plan covers all features and functionalities of ADPA, including its core PMBOK document generation, technical design document generation, strategic statement generation, enhanced project analysis, context management, and CLI interface.  Specific features are detailed in Section 2.  This plan does *not* cover the underlying AI models (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) themselves, but rather ADPA's integration and use of those models.

* **Objectives:** To verify that ADPA meets all functional, non-functional, and security requirements; to identify and document defects; to ensure the software is ready for release; and to provide quantitative metrics on software quality.

* **Project Background:** ADPA is a revolutionary AI-powered tool designed to automate the creation of project management documentation based on PMBOK standards. It leverages advanced AI capabilities for contextual understanding, authority recognition, and professional synthesis.

* **Test Plan Assumptions:**
    * Access to all necessary test environments (hardware, software, data) will be available as outlined in Section 4.
    * The development team will provide timely bug fixes and updated builds.
    * Stakeholders will provide timely feedback on acceptance testing.
    * All team members possess the necessary skills and experience as outlined in Section 6.

* **Constraints:**
    * The testing timeline is constrained by the project deadline.
    * Resource availability may limit the extent of automated testing.
    * Access to certain AI models might be subject to usage limits or cost constraints.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features to be Tested:**
    * **PMBOK Document Generation:** All 29 PMBOK documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, etc.)
    * **Technical Design Document Generation:** 10 Specialized Technical Document Processors (Architecture Design, System Design, Database Schema, etc.)
    * **Strategic Statement Generation:** Company Values, Purpose Statements, Mission & Vision.
    * **Enhanced Project Analysis:** Automatic discovery and analysis of project documentation (README, requirements, architecture, etc.)
    * **Enhanced Context Manager:** Intelligent context building and utilization for different AI models.
    * **CLI Interface:** All command-line options and functionalities.
    * **Version Control System (VCS):** Local Git repository management for generated documents.
    * **Multi-AI Provider Support:** Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama.
    * **Error Handling and Reporting:** Graceful handling of errors and informative error messages.

* **Version Identification:** ADPA v2.1.3 (or latest stable release at testing commencement).

* **Build Information:**  To be specified by the development team upon release of the test build.

* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama APIs; Local file system; Git (for VCS).


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:**
    * **Unit Testing:** (Performed by developers)  Verification of individual components and modules.
    * **Integration Testing:** Verification of interactions between different modules and components.
    * **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete system.
    * **Acceptance Testing:** User acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the system meets user requirements.

* **Testing Types:**
    * **Functional Testing:** Verification that all features function as specified.
    * **Performance Testing:** Evaluation of response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
    * **Security Testing:** Assessment of vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards (where applicable, given the context).
    * **Usability Testing:** Evaluation of ease of use and user experience (primarily CLI).
    * **Regression Testing:** Retesting after bug fixes or code changes.

* **Test Design Techniques:**
    * Equivalence Partitioning
    * Boundary Value Analysis
    * Use Case Testing
    * Exploratory Testing

* **Automation Strategy:**  A combination of automated and manual testing will be employed.  Prioritization will be given to automating regression tests for core functionalities and CLI commands.  Selenium or Cypress may be used for UI-related testing (if applicable).  Test automation framework (e.g., Jest, Cypress) to be determined.

* **Tool Selection:**  Jira for defect tracking; TestRail (or similar) for test case management;  Specific automation framework to be determined based on feasibility and resource availability.


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  A system with sufficient processing power, memory, and storage capacity to run ADPA and associated testing tools.  Specific requirements will depend on the size and complexity of test data.

* **Software:** Node.js (version specified in project README),  testing frameworks (to be defined),  Jira, TestRail (or alternatives), AI provider SDKs (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, etc.).

* **Test Data:**  A representative set of project READMEs and related documentation will be required for testing.  This data should include various sizes and complexities of projects.  A data generation script might be beneficial.

* **Environment Setup and Configuration:** A detailed setup guide will be provided to the testing team.  This will include instructions for installing necessary software, configuring test environments, and setting up test data.

* **Access Requirements and Security Considerations:**  Access to test environments will be controlled and secured according to organizational policies.  Access to AI provider APIs will require appropriate authentication credentials.
