# Test Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Test Plan Overview**

* **Document Purpose:** This document outlines the testing strategy, approach, and execution plan for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA-RGA) API.  It details the scope, resources, schedule, and risk mitigation strategies for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application before release.

* **Scope:** This test plan covers the functional, performance, security, and usability testing of the ADPA-RGA API, including all documented endpoints and features (Document Generation API, Template Management API, and associated features).  It specifically targets the API's ability to generate BABOK v3 compliant documentation from provided input data.  Testing will be conducted across development, staging, and potentially production environments.  The included README indicates a focus on Fortune 500-level data processing; therefore, testing will leverage datasets representative of this scale to validate performance and accuracy.  The scope *excludes* testing of the underlying AI models (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) unless specifically indicated as a component for failure analysis.

* **Objectives:** Verify the functionality, performance, security, and usability of the ADPA-RGA API.  Identify and resolve defects before release to production.  Ensure the API meets the defined quality criteria (detailed below).

* **Project Background:** The ADPA-RGA API is a revolutionary tool designed to automate the generation of BABOK v3 compliant business analysis frameworks.  It leverages various AI providers and offers a robust API with features such as template management and job tracking.

* **Assumptions:** The development team will provide stable build versions for testing.  Necessary test environments (hardware, software, data) will be available as specified.  Required access to Azure resources and AI APIs will be granted.

* **Constraints:**  The testing timeline is constrained by the overall project schedule.  Resource availability may limit the extent of automated testing.  Access to specific AI models for testing may be limited by API usage quotas.


**2. Test Items and Features**

* **Features to be Tested:**
    * Document Generation API (`POST /api/v1/documents/convert`, `GET /api/v1/documents/jobs`, `GET /api/v1/documents/jobs/{id}/status`, `GET /api/v1/documents/download/{id}`)
    * Template Management API (`POST /api/v1/templates`, `GET /api/v1/templates`, `GET /api/v1/templates/{id}`, `PUT /api/v1/templates/{id}`)
    * Health Check Endpoints (`GET /api/v1/health`, `GET /api/v1/health/ready`)
    * Authentication and Authorization (API Key, JWT)
    * Error Handling and Response Codes
    * Input Validation (Zod schemas)
    * Rate Limiting
    * Logging and Monitoring

* **Version Identification:**  3.1.1 (as per project metadata).  Specific build number will be determined for each testing phase.

* **Dependencies and Integration Points:**  Azure AI services (OpenAI, potentially others), database (if applicable), external template storage (if applicable).


**3. Test Approach and Strategy**

* **Testing Levels:** Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance (UAT).

* **Testing Types:** Functional, Performance, Security, Usability.

* **Test Design Techniques:** Equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, state transition testing, use case testing, exploratory testing.  Data-driven testing will be used extensively, particularly for performance and volume testing.

* **Automation Strategy:**  API testing will be primarily automated using tools such as Postman, REST-assured (or similar Java-based tool), or Cypress.  Unit tests provided by the development team will also be reviewed and executed.  A decision on the extent of UI test automation (if applicable) will be made based on available resources and time constraints.

* **Tool Selection:** Postman,  REST-assured (or equivalent), JMeter (performance testing), OWASP ZAP (security testing), potentially Cypress (UI testing if applicable).


**4. Test Environment Requirements**

* **Hardware:**  Sufficient server resources for API execution and load testing (to be defined based on expected load and performance requirements).  Client machines for manual and automated testing.

* **Software:**  Node.js, npm, testing tools (Postman, REST-assured, JMeter, OWASP ZAP, potentially Cypress), database client (if applicable), Azure CLI (if required for environment setup).

* **Test Data:**  Large datasets representative of Fortune 500-scale organizations, including realistic requirements, stakeholder information, and relevant regulatory details.  Test data management will include data masking and anonymization techniques where necessary.  A subset of smaller datasets will be used for initial testing and debugging.

* **Environment Setup:**  Detailed instructions for setting up the test environments will be provided by the development team.  This will include database setup, API key configuration, and any other necessary steps.

* **Access Requirements:**  Access to the test environments and Azure resources will be controlled and documented.
