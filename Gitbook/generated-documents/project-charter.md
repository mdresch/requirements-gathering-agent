**Description:** Executive Project Charter with Full Organizational Authority


## 1. Executive Summary

This charter authorizes the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  The project's strategic importance stems from its ability to address the significant inefficiencies and risks associated with manual project documentation.  ADPA leverages AI to generate comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation, including strategic statements, significantly reducing time and effort while ensuring consistency and accuracy.  The 175 weekly downloads on NPM demonstrate strong market validation and the project's potential for substantial ROI.  This initiative aligns directly with the organization's strategic objective of [Insert Organizational Strategic Objective from Business Case, e.g., "improving project delivery efficiency and reducing administrative overhead"].  The projected ROI, detailed in the Business Case, justifies the allocation of resources outlined below.  This charter grants the Project Manager full authority to execute the project within the defined scope, budget, and timeline.


## 2. Project Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives:**

* **Increase Project Delivery Efficiency:** Reduce project documentation time by 75% within six months of launch.  This will be measured by comparing the average documentation time for projects before and after ADPA implementation.
* **Improve Documentation Quality and Consistency:** Achieve a PMBOK 7.0 compliance score of 95% or higher on all generated documents, as assessed by the built-in validation system.
* **Enhance Stakeholder Alignment:** Achieve a stakeholder satisfaction rating of 4.5 out of 5 (based on post-project surveys) regarding the clarity and usefulness of project documentation.
* **Achieve Market Penetration:** Secure 500 weekly downloads on NPM within one year of launch.

**Success Criteria:**  Achievement of all primary objectives.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Average documentation time, PMBOK compliance score, stakeholder satisfaction rating, NPM weekly downloads, and cost variance.


## 3. Project Scope and Deliverables
