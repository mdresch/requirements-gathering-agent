Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent
Project Title
Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA)

Project Purpose
The Requirements Gathering Agent project aims to develop a tool that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to generate PMBOK-compliant project documents, primarily focusing on automating the creation of project charters, management plans, and other essential deliverables for projects of varying complexity. This tool addresses the growing need for efficiency, accuracy, and standardization in project documentation, enabling project managers to focus on strategic value delivery rather than administrative overhead.

Business Case
Organizations often face challenges related to delays, errors in documentation, and non-compliance with PMBOK standards, which can lead to increased costs and reduced stakeholder confidence. The RGA will eliminate these inefficiencies by automating the document generation process, cutting down on manual effort, and ensuring compliance with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.

Strategic Alignment
This project aligns with the company's digital transformation strategy and its commitment to leveraging AI-driven solutions to improve operational efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance project delivery capabilities.

Measurable Project Objectives
Automate Document Generation

Generate all 29 PMBOK-compliant documents with a single command.
Success Measure: 100% of documents accurately generated within five minutes for projects with under 100 input files.
Timeline: Beta release by December 15, 2025.
Ensure Compliance with PMBOK Standards

Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
Success Measure: 95% compliance as determined by automated validation reports.
Timeline: Validation engine completion by January 30, 2026.
User-Friendly Implementation

Develop a command-line interface (CLI) with intuitive options for customization.
Success Measure: User acceptance score â‰¥ 90% in usability testing.
Timeline: CLI development completed by November 30, 2025.
Optimize Operating Costs

Support multiple AI providers to manage costs efficiently.
Success Measure: Reduce total infrastructure costs by 20% compared to using a single AI provider.
Timeline: Integration with multiple AI providers completed by February 28, 2026.
High-Level Requirements
Functional Requirements

Must generate complete, PMBOK-compliant project charters and management plans.
Must support multiple file formats (e.g., Markdown, JSON, YAML) for input and output documents.
Must validate generated documents for compliance and quality against PMBOK standards.
Must generate detailed summary reports for context utilization.
Business Requirements

Automate stakeholder engagement by generating user-specific documentation, such as user personas and stakeholder analyses.
Provide options for cross-team collaboration on a shared platform.
Non-Functional Requirements

High performance to generate documents in under five minutes.
Secure handling of project data, including the encryption of API keys.
Scalable infrastructure for handling projects of various sizes.
Extensibility for future features and integrations.
Compliance Requirements

Ensure adherence to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
Incorporate regulatory compliance for industries with strict documentation requirements (e.g., healthcare, finance).
Assumptions and Constraints

The tool assumes input documents are well-structured for machine readability.
Development is constrained by allocated budget and resource availability.

Budget Milestones and Phasing
Phase 1 (Initiation and Planning): $8,000 allocated for stakeholder analysis, requirements gathering, and project kick-off.
Phase 2 (Development): $25,000 allocated for coding, integration, and initial testing.
Phase 3 (Validation and Deployment): $12,000 allocated for QA, certification, and deployment.
Phase 4 (Post-Implementation): $5,000 allocated for user training and post-go-live support.
Integration Elements
Dependencies
The document-generation module depends on accurate input data and the successful development of the AI integration module.
Validation against PMBOK standards is contingent on the successful completion of the PMBOK compliance validation engine.
Resource Allocation
