# Project Charter

## 1. Project Title
Requirements Gathering Agent â€“ AI-Powered Requirements Gathering and PMBOK Documentation Generator

## 2. Project Purpose / Business Need
Modern enterprises face challenges in efficiently gathering comprehensive project requirements and producing standardized project management documentation aligned with PMBOK guidelines. The Requirements Gathering Agent addresses this need by automating the generation of strategic planning documents and PMBOK-compliant artifacts using advanced AI models from multiple providers, ensuring flexibility, enterprise-grade security, and offline capabilities.

## 3. Measurable Project Objectives
- Develop an AI-powered tool that supports multiple AI providers including Azure OpenAI (with Entra ID and API key), GitHub AI Models, Ollama (local AI), and Azure AI Studio.
- Enable automatic generation of all key PMBOK documents spanning Initiating and Planning Process Groups, including Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, and others.
- Provide a modular, extensible architecture with command-line interface and Node.js/TypeScript integration for easy adoption in diverse enterprise environments.
- Achieve at least 90% accuracy and completeness in AI-generated documents as evaluated by expert project managers.
- Ensure secure authentication and access compliance, particularly for enterprise Azure OpenAI deployments.
- Support offline development scenarios through local AI model integration (Ollama).

## 4. High-Level Project Description and Boundaries
The Requirements Gathering Agent will automate the creation of project management documentation by leveraging AI across multiple providers. It will include:

- Strategic planning document generation (vision, mission, core values, purpose).
- Comprehensive PMBOK-aligned document generation for Initiating and Planning process groups.
- Support for detailed planning artifacts such as WBS, Activity Lists, Milestone Lists, and Risk Analysis.
- Technical features such as multi-provider support, automatic fallback, and strict JSON output for integration.

**Boundaries:**

- The tool will not manage actual project execution or monitoring beyond document generation.
- It will not integrate AI providers outside of the defined set (Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, Ollama, Azure AI Studio).
- The product focuses on documentation generation and does not include project collaboration or task management features.

## 5. Key Deliverables
- AI-powered Requirements Gathering and Strategic Planning module.
- PMBOK-compliant document generation modules including:
  - Project Charter
  - Stakeholder Register
  - Scope, Schedule, Cost, Quality, Resource, Communications, Risk, Procurement, and Stakeholder Engagement Plans
  - Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary
  - Activity List, Activity Duration Estimates, Activity Resource Estimates
  - Schedule Network Diagram and Milestone List
- Command-Line Interface for document generation.
- Integration guides and sample scripts for Node.js/TypeScript projects.
- Comprehensive README and Configuration documentation.
- Testing and validation reports for AI-generated content accuracy.
- Security and compliance documentation for enterprise deployments.

## 6. Assumptions
- AI providers will maintain API availability and support required features.
- End users have the necessary API keys or access credentials for preferred AI providers.
- Users have a basic understanding of PMBOK and project management documentation.
- The project environment supports Node.js 18+ and TypeScript 5.0+.
- Enterprise environments will configure Azure Entra ID authentication properly.
- Local AI models (Ollama) will be available and maintained for offline use.

## 7. Constraints
- AI model token limits and response times may affect document length and generation speed.
- Dependency on third-party AI provider uptime and rate limits.
- Security compliance must adhere to enterprise policies, especially for cloud-based AI.
- The initial version focuses on Initiating and Planning process groups; later expansions are out of scope.
- Offline AI models may have limited capabilities compared to cloud AI services.
- The project must be completed within the planned timeline and allocated budget.

## 8. High-Level Risks
- AI-generated content may require manual review and refinement to meet quality standards.
- Changes in AI provider APIs or pricing models could impact functionality or cost.
- Potential security vulnerabilities in handling API keys or authentication tokens.
- Adoption resistance due to unfamiliarity with AI-generated project documentation.
- Integration challenges in diverse enterprise environments with varying compliance requirements.
- Delays in configuring Azure Entra ID or other authentication mechanisms.
