# Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Project Purpose and Business Justification:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project aims to develop and deliver a sophisticated, AI-powered software tool that automates the generation of comprehensive project management documentation adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards. This addresses the significant time and resource constraints associated with manual documentation creation, enabling organizations to accelerate project initiation, enhance consistency, improve accuracy, and ensure compliance with industry best practices.  The RGA will provide a competitive advantage by streamlining project management processes and delivering higher quality documentation.

**2. Measurable Project Objectives:**

- **Automation:** Generate at least 95% of required PMBOK documents automatically with less than 5% requiring manual intervention.
- **Accuracy:** Achieve a minimum accuracy score of 90% (based on a predefined PMBOK compliance rubric) across generated documents.
- **Efficiency:** Reduce documentation preparation time by at least 50% compared to manual methods (based on benchmarking against existing processes).
- **Integration:** Support seamless integration with at least three major project management software applications via JSON export.
- **Adoption:** Achieve a minimum 70% adoption rate amongst target user groups within six months of release.
- **Security:** Ensure the tool meets or exceeds organization security policies, including robust authentication mechanisms.
- **Compliance:** Ensure all generated documents meet relevant regulatory and industry compliance standards.

**3. High-Level Requirements:**

- Automated generation of PMBOK 7th Edition compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc.).
- Multi-provider AI support (Azure OpenAI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama, potentially others).
- Flexible configuration options (API keys, environment variables, model selection).
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.
- Secure authentication and access control.
- Comprehensive JSON output with schema validation.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy usage and integration.
- User-friendly documentation (user guides, tutorials, FAQs).
- Modular architecture for extensibility and maintainability.


**4. High-Level Assumptions and Constraints:**

**Assumptions:**

- Stakeholder availability for requirements gathering and feedback.
- Stable and reliable performance of chosen AI providers' APIs.
- Sufficient access to necessary cloud resources and computing power.
- Adherence to PMBOK 7th Edition standards remains consistent throughout the project.
- Developers possess the necessary skills in Node.js, TypeScript, and Azure AI services.

**Constraints:**

- Project budget of [Insert Budget Amount].
- Project timeline of [Insert Timeline, e.g., 16 weeks].
- Dependency on availability and performance of third-party AI providers.
- Compliance with organizational security and data governance policies.
- Potential limitations on AI model capabilities (token limits, context windows).


**5. High-Level Project Description and Product Characteristics:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent is a Node.js/TypeScript-based CLI tool that leverages AI to generate PMBOK-compliant project management documentation.  It will offer a modular design, allowing for selective generation of documents and support for multiple AI providers. The output will be in a structured JSON format for easy integration with other project management tools.  The tool will include comprehensive documentation and will be distributed as an npm package.
