# Project Charter  
## Project Title  
Requirements Gathering Agent – AI-powered PMBOK Documentation Generator  

## Project Purpose / Business Justification  
In software and project management domains, comprehensive and standardized documentation is essential for project success and stakeholder alignment. This project aims to develop an AI-powered tool that automatically transforms a project's README file into a full suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documents. By leveraging Azure OpenAI's GPT-4 capabilities, the tool will increase efficiency, reduce manual documentation effort, and improve consistency and quality of project management deliverables. This supports organizations in accelerating documentation processes and adhering to industry best practices, ultimately enhancing project outcomes and governance.  

## Measurable Project Objectives  
- Develop and release a command-line tool (`requirements-gathering-agent`) that generates 28 PMBOK-standard project documents from a README file.  
- Integrate with multiple AI providers including Azure OpenAI (with Entra ID authentication), GitHub AI, and Ollama for flexible AI backend support.  
- Ensure generated documentation is organized into professional categorized directories (core analysis, project charter, management plans, planning artifacts, stakeholder management, technical analysis).  
- Achieve robust error handling and retry logic to guarantee at least 95% successful document generation in typical use cases.  
- Support modern TypeScript implementation with compatibility for Node.js v18+ environments.  
- Deliver comprehensive documentation and developer support resources, including installation, configuration, and usage instructions.  
- Obtain a minimum of 1000 downloads via npm within the first 6 months post-release.  

## High-Level Project Description and Boundaries  
This project will produce a TypeScript-based CLI tool capable of reading a project’s README and generating a full set of PMBOK-aligned documents automatically. The scope includes:  
- Developing AI integration modules for Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, and Ollama providers.  
- Implementing document generation logic for all 28 PMBOK documents, structured into defined categories.  
- Providing command-line options for selective document generation and retry logic.  
- Delivering thorough developer and user documentation.  

Out of scope:  
- GUI or web-based interfaces (CLI only).  
- Non-PMBOK related document generation.  
- Custom AI model training beyond provider configuration.
