## 1. Overview  
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to deliver a Node.js/TypeScript CLI tool that automates the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation using Azure OpenAI. This tool will transform project README files and supplementary documentation into comprehensive project artifacts, reducing manual effort, enhancing consistency, and ensuring compliance with PMBOK standards.  

The project aligns with strategic objectives of improving project documentation workflows, enabling automation in compliance processes, and supporting medium-to-large organizations in their project management needs.

## 2. Project Objectives  
### **Business Objectives:**  
- **Automate Project Documentation:** Provide an AI-powered solution for generating PMBOK-aligned project management artifacts.  
- **Ensure Compliance:** Guarantee adherence to PMBOK 7th Edition standards across generated documentation.  
- **Enhance Stakeholder Engagement:** Produce stakeholder-specific documents to improve alignment and collaboration.  
- **Optimize Efficiency:** Reduce manual documentation effort by up to 75% and improve document consistency.  

### **Technical Objectives:**  
- **Multi-Provider AI Integration:** Integrate Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama for robust AI-powered document generation.  
- **Advanced Context Management:** Utilize Enhanced Context Manager to maximize context utilization and document accuracy for large AI models.  
- **Modular Architecture:** Design a scalable and extensible system to accommodate future integrations and features.  
- **CLI Functionality:** Develop a user-friendly Command-Line Interface (CLI) for seamless interaction and configuration management.

## 3. High-Level Requirements  
### Functional Requirements:  
1. Automatically generate PMBOK-compliant project charters, stakeholder registers, management plans, and planning artifacts.  
2. Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7th Edition standards for completeness and compliance.  
3. Perform schema validation to ensure data integrity and interoperability.  
4. Integrate with Azure OpenAI and support multiple AI providers.  
5. Provide CLI-based functionality for document generation, validation, and troubleshooting.  

### Non-Functional Requirements:  
1. Ensure high performance and scalability to handle large documentation contexts (up to 2M tokens).  
2. Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for AI provider failures.  
3. Maintain cross-document consistency and standardized terminology.  
4. Deliver documentation outputs in professional formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML).  

---

## 4. Scope  
### **In-Scope:**  
- Development of the Requirements Gathering Agent CLI tool.  
- Integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.  
- Automated generation of PMBOK-compliant documents.  
- Comprehensive validation against PMBOK standards.  
- User documentation and tutorials for onboarding.  

### **Out-of-Scope:**  
- Development of graphical user interfaces (GUI).  
- Integration with non-AI-based project management tools.  
- Customization of PMBOK compliance standards for specific industries.

## 5. Deliverables  
### **Core Deliverables:**  
1. Requirements Gathering Agent CLI tool (v1.0).  
2. PMBOK-compliant project charter template.  
3. Management plans, including scope, risk, communication, and stakeholder engagement plans.  
4. Planning artifacts, such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and milestone lists.  
5. Stakeholder analysis and engagement documentation.  
6. User guides and tutorials for tool usage and configuration.  

### **Enhanced Deliverables:**  
1. Context utilization reports and analysis tools.  
2. Advanced validation reports for PMBOK compliance.  
3. Interactive AI provider selection menu integrated into the CLI.  

---

## 6. Assumptions  
- **Documentation Availability:** The project assumes that sufficient project documentation (README.md, architecture files, specifications, etc.) is available for analysis and context building.  
- **AI Provider Accessibility:** All integrated AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) will be accessible and functional during development and deployment.  
- **Stakeholder Participation:** Stakeholders will provide timely feedback on generated documentation to ensure alignment with requirements.  

---

## 7. Constraints  
- **Technical Constraints:** The tool must operate within the limitations of AI model token sizes (e.g., 2M tokens for Gemini 1.5 Pro).  
- **Compliance Constraints:** All generated outputs must adhere to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  
- **Resource Constraints:** Limited by the availability of AI provider APIs and their associated costs for usage.
