**Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent – PMBOK Documentation Generator**

**1. Project Title:** Requirements Gathering Agent – PMBOK Documentation Generator

**2. Project Manager:** [Your Name/Team Name]

**3. Project Sponsor:** [Sponsor Name and Title]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Start Date]

**5. Project Completion Date:** [End Date]

**6. Project Goals and Objectives:**

* To develop and deploy a Node.js-based command-line application that leverages AI (primarily Azure OpenAI, with support for alternatives) to generate a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation from a project's README file.
* To ensure the generated documentation is accurate, consistent, and adheres to PMBOK standards.
* To provide a user-friendly interface for generating documentation, including options for customization and selective document generation.
* To achieve a high level of code quality, maintainability, and scalability.
* To ensure the application is robust, handling potential errors and API limitations gracefully.

**7. Project Scope:**

**Inclusions:**

* Development of the core application logic for parsing README files and generating PMBOK documentation.
* Integration with Azure OpenAI, GitHub AI, and Ollama AI providers.
* Implementation of robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
* Creation of a user-friendly command-line interface.
* Development of comprehensive documentation for users and developers.
* Testing and quality assurance of the application.
* Deployment of the application (e.g., npm package).

**Exclusions:**

* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Integration with other project management tools beyond direct documentation generation.
* Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial release (unless specified in a separate support agreement).
* Integration with specific project management methodologies beyond PMBOK.

**8. Key Deliverables:**

* Functional Node.js application (npm package).
* Comprehensive documentation (user guide, developer guide).
* Unit tests and integration tests.
* Deployment to npm registry.

**9. Project Stakeholders:**

* **Sponsor:** [Sponsor Name and Title] - Provides funding and high-level direction.
* **Project Manager:** [Your Name/Team Name] - Manages the project execution.
* **Development Team:** [Team Members] - Develops and tests the application.
* **Users:** Project managers and teams needing PMBOK-compliant documentation.

**10. Project Assumptions:**

* Access to necessary AI APIs (Azure OpenAI, etc.) with appropriate credentials.
* Availability of sufficient computing resources for development and testing.
* Adequate time allocated for development, testing, and deployment.
* Consistent access to reliable internet connectivity.

**11. Project Constraints:**

* Project budget: [Budget Amount]
* Project timeline: [Start Date] to [End Date]
* Development team availability: [Team Member Availability]
* API usage limits and costs for AI providers.

**12. Project Risks:**

* API integration challenges: Potential incompatibility or limitations with AI provider APIs. Mitigation: Thorough testing and fallback mechanisms.
* Unexpected API costs:  Exceeding anticipated API usage limits. Mitigation: Monitoring API usage and implementing cost controls.
* Delays in development: Unforeseen technical challenges or team availability issues. Mitigation: Agile development methodology and proactive risk management.
* Accuracy of AI-generated documentation: Potential inaccuracies or inconsistencies in generated documents. Mitigation: Rigorous testing and human review process.

**13. Project Approvals:**

* **Project Sponsor Signature:** _________________________  Date: _____________
* **Project Manager Signature:** _________________________  Date: _____________


This Project Charter serves as a formal authorization to begin the Requirements Gathering Agent project.  Any changes to the scope, budget, or timeline will require a formal amendment to this charter.
