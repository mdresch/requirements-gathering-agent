## Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Project Title:** Requirements Gathering Agent

**2. Project Manager:** [Project Manager Name]

**3. Sponsor:** [Sponsor Name and Title]

**4. Date:** October 26, 2023

**5. Project Start Date:** [Start Date]

**6. Project Completion Date:** [Completion Date]

**7. Project Summary:**

The Requirements Gathering Agent project aims to develop and deploy a command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages AI (specifically Azure OpenAI, with fallback options for other providers like Google AI and Ollama) to automatically generate comprehensive project management documentation based on PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The tool will analyze project READMEs and associated documentation (requirements, architecture, stakeholder information, etc.) to create a complete suite of documents, including a project charter, scope management plan, risk management plan, etc.  The generated documents will be validated against PMBOK standards and undergo a quality assessment.  The project will focus on delivering a robust, scalable, and user-friendly tool suitable for enterprise use.

**8. Project Goals and Objectives:**

* **Goal 1:** Automate the creation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
    * **Objective 1.1:** Generate at least 29 PMBOK-compliant documents.
    * **Objective 1.2:** Achieve 95% accuracy in document generation based on provided project context.
    * **Objective 1.3:**  Implement PMBOK 7.0 validation and quality assessment features.
* **Goal 2:** Improve project planning and stakeholder alignment.
    * **Objective 2.1:** Reduce time spent on manual documentation by at least 75%.
    * **Objective 2.2:** Enhance stakeholder communication and understanding of project requirements.
* **Goal 3:** Deliver a robust and scalable solution.
    * **Objective 3.1:**  Implement comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms.
    * **Objective 3.2:**  Support multiple AI providers with flexible configuration options.
    * **Objective 3.3:** Ensure the tool is easily maintainable and extensible.


**9. Project Deliverables:**

* Functional and tested CLI tool.
* Comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant documentation templates.
* User documentation and tutorials.
* Deployment scripts and configuration guides.
* Quality Assurance reports and validation metrics.

**10. Key Stakeholders:**

* **Sponsor:** [Sponsor Name and Title] - Provides funding and overall direction.
* **Project Manager:** [Project Manager Name] - Manages the project execution.
* **Development Team:** [Team Members] - Develops the software.
* **QA Team:** [Team Members] - Tests the software and ensures quality.
* **End-users:** Project managers and other stakeholders who will use the tool.

**11. Assumptions:**

* Access to necessary Azure OpenAI (or alternative provider) APIs and resources.
* Availability of sufficient project documentation for accurate AI processing.
* Stable internet connectivity for API calls.
* Adequate technical expertise within the development and QA teams.

**12. Constraints:**

* Project budget: [Budget amount]
* Project timeline: [Timeline]
* Availability of specific AI model capabilities.
* Potential limitations in AI model accuracy.

**13. Risks:**

* **Risk 1:** AI model inaccuracies leading to errors in generated documentation.  **Mitigation:** Implement thorough QA processes and validation against PMBOK standards.
* **Risk 2:** Delays in API access or limitations in API availability. **Mitigation:** Explore alternative AI providers and implement robust error handling.
* **Risk 3:** Insufficient project documentation for accurate analysis. **Mitigation:** Clearly define documentation requirements and actively engage stakeholders in providing necessary information.

**14. Approvals:**
