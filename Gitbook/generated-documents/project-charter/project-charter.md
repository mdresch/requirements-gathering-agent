# Project Charter - ADPA: Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Charter Date:** June 19, 2025
**Project Manager:** [TO BE ASSIGNED]
**Executive Sponsor:** [EXECUTIVE SPONSOR NAME]
**PMO Director:** [PMO DIRECTOR NAME]


## 1. Executive Summary

This Project Charter authorizes the initiation of the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA represents a revolutionary breakthrough in AI-powered document generation, achieving unprecedented capabilities in contextual reasoning and hierarchical authority recognition.  This initiative is strategically critical due to [AI_SYNTHESIS: Briefly summarize the strategic business rationale from the Business Case, highlighting key drivers like improved efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced decision-making, or competitive advantage.  Quantify benefits where possible, e.g., "projected 20% reduction in documentation time," or "estimated $X million ROI over Y years"].  The project's success is directly linked to achieving [AI_SYNTHESIS:  State the 1-2 most important high-level business objectives from the Business Case].  The successful completion of this project will deliver significant value to the organization by [AI_SYNTHESIS: Briefly state the key strategic value proposition from the Business Case].

## 2. Project Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives:**

1.  Develop and deploy a fully functional AI-powered documentation assistant capable of generating PMBOK-compliant project management documents and technical design documentation.
2.  Achieve a 20% reduction in documentation time and effort across relevant projects within the first year of deployment.
3.  Enhance the quality and consistency of project documentation across the organization, leading to improved decision-making and reduced project risks.


**Success Criteria:**

*   **Quantitative:** Successful generation and validation of at least 90% of the target PMBOK documents, achievement of a 20% reduction in average documentation time as measured by [specific metric, e.g., time tracking software], and a user satisfaction score of at least 4.5 out of 5 based on [specific survey methodology].
*   **Qualitative:** Positive stakeholder feedback on document quality and usability, demonstrable improvements in project planning and execution efficiency, and successful integration with existing organizational workflows.


**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

*   Average documentation time per project (measured in hours).
*   Number of PMBOK documents successfully generated and validated.
*   User satisfaction score (based on post-implementation surveys).
*   Number of projects utilizing ADPA.
*   Frequency of ADPA usage.


## 3. Project Scope and Deliverables

**High-Level Scope:**  The ADPA project encompasses the development, testing, deployment, and initial support of an AI-powered documentation assistant that leverages advanced contextual understanding and authority recognition to generate high-quality, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project management documents and technical design documents.  This includes the full suite of PMBOK documents, as well as the newly developed technical design document generation system.

**Major Deliverables:**

1.  Fully functional ADPA software application with integrated AI provider support (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
2.  Comprehensive documentation including user guides, training materials, and technical specifications.
3.  Successful completion of user acceptance testing (UAT) with a minimum pass rate of 95%.
4.  Deployment of ADPA into the organization's production environment.
5.  Post-implementation support and user training.


**Scope Boundaries:**

**In Scope:** Development and deployment of ADPA; user training and support; integration with approved AI providers; generation of PMBOK documents and technical design documents.

**Out of Scope:**  Integration with third-party project management tools beyond initial testing;  custom development of new document types beyond those currently defined; ongoing maintenance beyond initial support period.
