# Project Charter

## Project Title
**Requirements Gathering Agent**

---

## Project Purpose and Justification

### Purpose:
The **Requirements Gathering Agent** aims to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation using AI technologies. This solution addresses the challenges of manually creating accurate, consistent, and compliant project management artifacts by leveraging advanced AI models and context management systems.

### Justification:
The project solves inefficiencies in manual documentation processes, reduces errors, ensures compliance with PMBOK standards, and enhances stakeholder alignment. By automating documentation workflows, the tool improves productivity and governance, benefiting project teams, PMOs, and organizations requiring formal project documentation.

## Project Objectives

### Primary Objectives:
1. Develop an AI-powered Node.js/TypeScript tool capable of generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
2. Integrate the tool with Azure OpenAI and other AI providers (Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).
3. Ensure the tool validates documents against PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
4. Provide a CLI interface for efficient user interaction and configuration management.

### Secondary Objectives:
1. Enhance the tool with a context management system to optimize AI model utilization.
2. Deliver comprehensive project analysis by processing all relevant markdown files beyond README.md.
3. Support modular architecture for future integration with third-party tools.

---

## Success Criteria and Metrics

### Success Criteria:
1. The tool generates PMBOK-compliant documentation, including project charters, stakeholder registers, management plans, and technical analysis documents.
2. Weekly downloads exceed **175**, demonstrating market adoption.
3. AI models utilize up to **90% of context tokens** for large models such as Gemini 1.5 Pro.
4. Document quality scores surpass **85/100** in PMBOK compliance validation.

### Key Metrics:
- **Adoption Metrics:** Weekly downloads (Target: 200+ after release).
- **Performance Metrics:** Context utilization percentage (Target: >50% for smaller models, >80% for ultra-large models).
- **Compliance Metrics:** PMBOK validation scores (Target: >85/100 for all generated documents).
- **User Feedback:** Positive feedback rate (Target: >90%).

## High-Level Requirements

### Functional Requirements:
1. Automatically generate PMBOK-compliant documents.
2. Validate generated documents for PMBOK 7th Edition compliance.
3. Discover and analyze all markdown files in a project for enriched context.
4. Provide CLI commands for document generation, validation, and analysis.
5. Support multiple AI providers and fallback mechanisms.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1. Ensure high scalability to handle large projects with extensive documentation.
2. Provide robust error handling and retry logic.
3. Maintain strict JSON output formatting for interoperability.
4. Optimize performance for AI model context utilization.

## Assumptions, Constraints, and Risks

### Assumptions:
1. The AI models (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro) will reliably process large contexts.
2. Stakeholders will provide comprehensive project documentation for analysis.
3. The tool will operate within a Node.js environment with minimal dependencies.

### Constraints:
1. The tool must comply with PMBOK 7th Edition standards.
2. Integration with AI providers must adhere to their API usage policies and token limits.
3. Development must be completed within **6 months**.

### Risks:
1. **Technology Risk:** AI providers may change their APIs, impacting integration.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement modular architecture and fallback mechanisms.
2. **Performance Risk:** Large projects may exceed token limits for smaller AI models.
   - *Mitigation:* Optimize context injection and provide user-configurable limits.
3. **Compliance Risk:** Generated documents may not fully meet PMBOK standards.
   - *Mitigation:* Implement robust validation checks and feedback loops.
