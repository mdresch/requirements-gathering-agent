## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This Project Management Plan (PMP) is created following the PMBOK Guide 7th Edition standards for the "Requirements Gathering Agent" project.  It leverages the provided project README and supplementary documentation.

**1. Project Charter:**

* **Project Goal:** Develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered command-line tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation based on project context extracted from various sources (README, markdown files, etc.).
* **Project Objectives:**
    * Successfully develop and test the Requirements Gathering Agent.
    * Achieve 95% PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation score across all generated documents.
    * Integrate with at least three AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI).
    * Achieve 80% context utilization for large language models (LLMs) like Gemini.
    * Deploy the tool to npm for public accessibility.
* **High-Level Requirements:**  Refer to the README's "Features" section for a comprehensive list.
* **Project Sponsor:** [Insert Sponsor Name/Title]
* **Project Manager:** [Insert Project Manager Name/Title]
* **Stakeholders:**  Refer to README's "Key Stakeholders" section and the generated `Stakeholder Register` document.
* **Budget:** [Insert Budget]
* **Timeline:** [Insert Project Timeline] (This will be detailed further in the Schedule Management Plan)
* **Assumptions:**  [List project assumptions, e.g., availability of AI APIs, sufficient resources]
* **Constraints:** [List project constraints, e.g., budget limitations, specific technology requirements]


**2. Project Scope Statement:**

* **Project Deliverables:**  The core deliverable is a functional Requirements Gathering Agent tool, including source code, documentation (user guide, API documentation), and deployment to npm.  Additional deliverables include comprehensive PMBOK-compliant documentation templates.
* **Project Exclusions:**  [List excluded aspects, e.g., integration with specific third-party PM tools beyond initial testing.]
* **Acceptance Criteria:** The tool must meet all functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the README and supplementary documents.  This includes successful generation of PMBOK-compliant documents, successful integration with target AI providers, and passing comprehensive unit and integration testing.


**3. Stakeholder Register:**

* This document will be generated by the Requirements Gathering Agent itself, based on information extracted from the provided documentation.  It will include a list of stakeholders, their roles, interests, influence, and communication preferences.


**4. Requirements Management Plan:**

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  This will be generated by the Requirements Gathering Agent, linking requirements to specific documents and deliverables.
* **Requirements Prioritization:**  Prioritization will be based on MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have) and stakeholder input.  (Details in generated documents).
* **Change Management Process:** A formal change control process will be established to manage any changes to the project scope or requirements.


**5. Schedule Management Plan:**

* **Project Schedule:** A detailed project schedule will be developed using a suitable methodology (e.g., Gantt chart) outlining tasks, durations, dependencies, and milestones.  The schedule will be generated using the Requirements Gathering Agent based on the work breakdown structure (WBS).
* **Critical Path Analysis:**  The critical path will be identified to highlight tasks that require close monitoring to prevent delays.
* **Schedule Baseline:**  A baseline schedule will be established and regularly monitored against actual progress.
* **Schedule Control:** Processes for managing schedule variances and resolving conflicts will be implemented.


**6. Cost Management Plan:**

* **Budget Estimation:**  A detailed budget will be created, allocating costs to various project activities.
* **Cost Baseline:**  A cost baseline will be established and monitored against actual costs.
* **Cost Control:**  Processes for managing cost variances and identifying cost-saving opportunities will be implemented.


**7. Quality Management Plan:**

* **Quality Standards:** PMBOK 7.0 compliance and other relevant industry standards will be the quality benchmarks.
* **Quality Control:**  Regular quality checks will be performed throughout the project lifecycle.  This includes automated PMBOK compliance checks within the Requirements Gathering Agent and manual reviews of generated documents.
* **Quality Assurance:**  Independent testing and validation of the tool and generated documents will be performed.


**8. Resource Management Plan:**

* **Resource Identification:**  Identify all resources required for the project, including personnel, software, hardware, and other materials.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Allocate resources to project activities based on their availability and skills.
* **Resource Leveling:**  Techniques for optimizing resource utilization and minimizing conflicts will be employed.


**9. Communications Management Plan:**

* **Communication Methods:**  Define communication channels and methods for different stakeholders (e.g., email, meetings, project management software).
* **Communication Frequency:**  Establish regular communication schedules for progress updates and issue resolution.
* **Communication Responsibilities:**  Assign communication responsibilities to team members.


**10. Risk Management Plan:**

* **Risk Identification:**  Identify potential risks that could impact the project.  (Refer to the README's "Outstanding/Recent Issues & Fixes" section for examples).
* **Risk Analysis:**  Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk.
* **Risk Response Planning:**  Develop mitigation strategies for identified risks.
* **Risk Monitoring and Control:**  Regularly monitor risks and take corrective actions as needed.


**11. Procurement Management Plan:**

* This plan will address the procurement of any necessary third-party software or services.


**12. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**

* A detailed WBS will be generated by the Requirements Gathering Agent, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable tasks.


**13.  Team Management Plan:**

* **Team Structure:** Define roles and responsibilities within the project team.
* **Team Communication:**  Establish communication protocols and processes.
* **Team Conflict Resolution:**  Define procedures for addressing team conflicts.


**14.  Project Governance:**

*  Define the governance structure for the project, including decision-making processes and approvals.


This Project Management Plan will be a living document, updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  The Requirements Gathering Agent will be instrumental in generating and maintaining many sections of this plan, ensuring consistency and accuracy.  The plan will be regularly reviewed and updated based on project progress and identified risks.
