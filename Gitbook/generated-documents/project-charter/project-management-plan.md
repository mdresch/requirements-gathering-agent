## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the project management plan for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, adhering to the PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The RGA is an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation from project README files and associated documentation.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** Develop and launch a robust, user-friendly, and scalable AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* **Objectives:**
    * Achieve 95% PMBOK 7.0 compliance in generated documents.
    * Achieve a 90% user satisfaction rate based on post-launch surveys.
    * Achieve 500 weekly downloads within 3 months of launch.
    * Maintain a system uptime of 99.9%.
    * Complete development within 6 months.


**3. Project Scope**

The project scope encompasses the design, development, testing, deployment, and initial support of the RGA tool.  This includes:

* **In-Scope:**  Development of the core application,  CLI interface, integration with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama), comprehensive project analysis capabilities, PMBOK 7.0 validation, version control system integration, and initial user documentation.
* **Out-of-Scope:** Integration with third-party project management software (initially),  extensive customization options beyond CLI flags, and dedicated customer support beyond initial documentation.


**4. Stakeholders**

* **Project Sponsor:** [Name of Sponsor/Organization]
* **Project Manager:** [Your Name/Title]
* **Development Team:** [List Team Members and Roles]
* **Users:** Project Managers, Business Analysts, and other stakeholders needing project documentation.


**5. Project Schedule**

*(A Gantt chart would be included here, visually representing tasks, dependencies, and durations.  This example uses a simplified textual representation.)*

**Phase 1: Initiation (1 month)**
* Define project scope and objectives.
* Develop project charter.
* Identify and onboard the development team.
* Set up development environment.

**Phase 2: Planning (1 month)**
* Create detailed work breakdown structure (WBS).
* Develop detailed project schedule.
* Define resource allocation plan.
* Develop risk management plan.
* Develop communication management plan.

**Phase 3: Execution (3 months)**
* Develop core application functionality.
* Integrate with AI providers.
* Develop and test CLI interface.
* Develop and test PMBOK validation module.
* Develop and test version control system integration.
* Develop user documentation.

**Phase 4: Monitoring and Controlling (Ongoing)**
* Track progress against schedule and budget.
* Manage risks and issues.
* Monitor user feedback and make necessary adjustments.

**Phase 5: Closure (1 month)**
* Final testing and quality assurance.
* Deployment to production environment.
* Post-launch review and documentation.


**6. Budget**

*(A detailed budget breakdown would be included here, outlining costs for personnel, software, hardware, and other resources.)*

**7. Resources**

* **Human Resources:** Developers, testers, project manager.
* **Software Resources:**  Node.js, TypeScript, Azure OpenAI SDKs, testing frameworks, version control system (Git).
* **Hardware Resources:** Development machines, servers (if applicable).


**8. Risk Management**

*(A detailed risk register would be included here, identifying potential risks, their likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies.)*  Examples include:

* **Risk:** API provider outages impacting functionality.
* **Mitigation:** Implement fallback mechanisms and multiple provider support.
* **Risk:** Unexpected delays in AI model development.
* **Mitigation:** Maintain close communication with AI provider and adjust schedule as needed.


**9. Communication Management**

* **Communication Methods:** Regular team meetings, email updates, project management software (e.g., Jira, Asana).
* **Communication Frequency:** Weekly team meetings, bi-weekly progress reports to sponsor.
* **Communication Channels:** Email, project management software, instant messaging.


**10. Quality Management**

* **Quality Standards:** Adherence to PMBOK 7th Edition standards, code quality standards (e.g., ESLint), and unit/integration testing.
* **Quality Control:**  Code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing (UAT).


**11. Procurement Management**

*(If applicable, a detailed procurement plan would be included here, outlining the process for acquiring necessary resources.)*  This might include cloud service contracts for AI providers.


**12. Stakeholder Management**

Regular communication with stakeholders through various channels will ensure alignment and manage expectations.  This includes providing regular updates on progress, addressing concerns, and seeking feedback.


**13. Project Closure**

The project will be formally closed upon successful deployment and completion of post-launch activities.  This includes documenting lessons learned and archiving project materials.


**14. Appendix**

*(This section would include supporting documents such as the project charter, WBS, risk register, etc.)*


This project management plan provides a high-level overview.  More detailed plans for each management area will be developed and maintained throughout the project lifecycle.  Regular updates and revisions to this plan will be made as needed.
