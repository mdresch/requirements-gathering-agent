## Project Management Plan: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Project Management Plan (PMP) for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent project, adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.  The project aims to deliver a production-ready API capable of generating BABOK v3-compliant business analysis frameworks in seconds.  This plan details the project's scope, schedule, budget, resources, risks, and communication strategy.

**2. Project Goal and Objectives**

* **Goal:** Develop and deploy a high-performance, secure, and scalable API that automates the generation of BABOK v3-compliant business analysis frameworks.
* **Objectives:**
    * Achieve 90% reduction in requirements gathering time compared to traditional methods.
    * Ensure 100% BABOK v3 compliance in generated frameworks.
    * Deliver a Fortune 500-grade, production-ready API within the allocated budget and timeline.
    * Achieve high user satisfaction (measured by post-implementation surveys).
    * Maintain a robust and scalable architecture for future expansion and integration.

**3. Project Scope**

The project scope includes:

* **In Scope:**
    * Development of a RESTful API using Express.js and TypeScript.
    * Implementation of BABOK v3 framework generation logic.
    * Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc., as defined in the Requirements Management Plan).
    * Robust error handling and security measures (authentication, authorization, rate limiting).
    * Comprehensive API documentation (OpenAPI specification).
    * Unit and integration testing.
    * Deployment to a production environment (Azure, as per the Deployment Plan).
    * User documentation and training materials.

* **Out of Scope:**
    * Integration with third-party project management tools (initially).  This will be considered in future phases.
    * Development of custom AI models.  The project will leverage existing, commercially available AI services.
    * Support for languages other than English (initially).

**4. Project Schedule**

*(A detailed Gantt chart should be included here, visualizing tasks, dependencies, and milestones.  The schedule should be based on the information in the provided documents, specifically the Requirements Management Plan and any associated task breakdown.)*

**Key Milestones:**

* **Milestone 1 (Week 4):** Completion of API design and specification (OpenAPI).
* **Milestone 2 (Week 8):** Completion of core API functionality (BABOK framework generation).
* **Milestone 3 (Week 12):** Completion of security and error handling implementation.
* **Milestone 4 (Week 16):** Completion of unit and integration testing.
* **Milestone 5 (Week 20):** Deployment to production environment.
* **Milestone 6 (Week 22):** Completion of user documentation and training materials.

**5. Project Budget**

*(A detailed budget breakdown should be included here, categorized by resource type (personnel, software licenses, cloud infrastructure, etc.).  This should be based on estimations provided in relevant project documents.)*

**6. Resources**

* **Project Manager:** [Name and contact information]
* **Development Team:** [List team members with roles and responsibilities]
* **QA Team:** [List team members with roles and responsibilities]
* **Software & Tools:**  Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, Jest, OpenAPI Generator, Azure DevOps (or equivalent).
* **Infrastructure:** Azure cloud resources (as specified in the Deployment Plan).

**7. Risk Management**

*(A detailed risk register should be included here, identifying potential risks, their probability and impact, and mitigation strategies.  This should be based on the Risk Management Plan, if provided, and informed by the project context.)*

**Example Risks:**

* **Risk 1:**  AI provider API downtime.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement fallback mechanisms to alternative providers.
* **Risk 2:**  Unexpected delays in development.
    * **Mitigation:**  Agile methodology, regular sprint reviews, proactive risk monitoring.
* **Risk 3:**  Integration challenges with Azure services.
    * **Mitigation:**  Dedicated integration testing phase, Azure expert consultation.


**8. Communication Management**

* **Communication Plan:**  Daily stand-up meetings for the development team, weekly progress reports to stakeholders, and monthly executive summaries.
* **Communication Methods:**  Email, project management software (Jira, Azure DevOps), instant messaging (Slack, Teams).
* **Stakeholders:**  Project Sponsor, Development Team, QA Team, Business Analysts, End-users.

**9. Quality Management**

* **Quality Standards:**  Adherence to PMBOK standards, BABOK v3 specifications, and coding best practices.
* **Quality Control:**  Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, user acceptance testing.
* **Quality Assurance:**  Code reviews, static analysis, regular testing cycles.

**10. Procurement Management**

*(This section should detail any external procurements, such as software licenses or consulting services.  This information should be derived from relevant project documents.)*

**11. Stakeholder Management**

*(This section should outline a stakeholder engagement plan, including communication strategies and methods for managing expectations.  This should be based on the Stakeholder Management Plan, if provided, and informed by the project context.)*

**12. Change Management**

A formal change control process will be implemented to manage changes to the project scope, schedule, and budget.  All change requests will be documented, assessed, and approved (or rejected) by the appropriate stakeholders.

**13. Project Closure**

The project will be formally closed upon completion of all deliverables, acceptance by stakeholders, and documentation of lessons learned.  A post-implementation review will be conducted to assess project performance and identify areas for improvement.


This Project Management Plan serves as a living document and will be updated regularly throughout the project lifecycle to reflect changes and progress.  Any deviations from this plan will be documented and approved through the change control process.
