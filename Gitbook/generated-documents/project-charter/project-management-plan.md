## Project Management Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Project Management Plan (PMP) for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  This plan adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards and provides a comprehensive framework for managing the project from initiation to closure.  The project's primary goal is to deliver a robust, AI-powered documentation generation tool capable of producing high-quality, PMBOK-compliant project documentation.

**2. Project Scope Management**

**2.1 Project Objectives:**

* Develop a sophisticated AI-powered tool capable of generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* Achieve 95% accuracy in document generation.
* Integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
* Develop a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
* Implement a comprehensive version control system for generated documents.
* Maintain a high level of code quality and maintainability.
* Achieve at least 200 weekly NPM downloads within 6 months of launch.

**2.2 Project Deliverables:**

* Functional ADPA application with CLI and API integration.
* Comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant document templates.
* User documentation, including tutorials and troubleshooting guides.
* Automated testing suite.
* Deployment scripts and infrastructure.

**2.3 Project Scope Statement:**

The ADPA project encompasses the design, development, testing, and deployment of an AI-powered documentation generation tool.  The tool will utilize various AI models to generate PMBOK-compliant documents from project context extracted from provided documentation.  Out of scope are integrations with specific enterprise systems beyond AI providers (unless explicitly added as a future phase).

**2.4 Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  (A detailed WBS will be created and maintained in a project management tool, such as Microsoft Project or Jira.)  The high-level WBS includes:

* **1.0 Project Initiation:**  Charter creation, stakeholder identification.
* **2.0 Requirements Gathering:** Define functional and non-functional requirements.
* **3.0 Design:** System architecture, database design, UI/UX design, API design.
* **4.0 Development:** Coding, unit testing, integration testing.
* **5.0 Testing:** System testing, user acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, security testing.
* **6.0 Deployment:** Deployment to production environment, release notes.
* **7.0 Project Closure:** Final documentation, lessons learned.


**3. Schedule Management**

**3.1 Project Timeline:** (A detailed Gantt chart will be developed and maintained in a project management tool.)  The high-level timeline will be broken down into phases, with estimated durations:

* **Phase 1: Initiation (1 week):**  Define project charter, identify stakeholders.
* **Phase 2: Requirements (2 weeks):**  Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
* **Phase 3: Design (4 weeks):**  Complete system design and database design.
* **Phase 4: Development (8 weeks):**  Develop and unit test the application.
* **Phase 5: Testing (4 weeks):**  Conduct comprehensive testing, including UAT.
* **Phase 6: Deployment (1 week):** Deploy to production and create release documentation.
* **Phase 7: Closure (1 week):**  Finalize documentation and lessons learned.

**3.2 Milestones:**

* Requirements finalized
* Design review completed
* Development milestone 1 (Core functionality)
* Development milestone 2 (Advanced features)
* UAT sign-off
* Deployment to production
* Project closure report submitted

**4. Cost Management**

**4.1 Budget:** (A detailed budget will be developed and tracked using a project management tool.)  The budget will include:

* Personnel costs (developers, testers, project manager)
* Software licenses (AI providers, testing tools)
* Infrastructure costs (cloud hosting, etc.)
* Contingency

**4.2 Cost Control:** The budget will be monitored regularly, and variances will be analyzed and reported. A change control process will be used to manage any budget changes.

**5. Quality Management**

**5.1 Quality Standards:**  The project will adhere to industry best practices for software development, including code reviews, unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.  PMBOK standards will guide document generation quality.

**5.2 Quality Control:** Regular code reviews, automated testing, and UAT will ensure the quality of the deliverables.

**6. Resource Management**

**6.1 Team Members:** The project team will consist of experienced developers, testers, and a project manager.  Roles and responsibilities will be clearly defined.

**6.2 Resource Allocation:** Resources will be allocated to tasks based on their skills and availability.  A resource management tool will be used to track resource utilization.

**7. Communications Management**

**7.1 Communication Plan:**  Regular communication will be maintained with stakeholders through:

* Weekly status meetings
* Monthly progress reports
* Email updates for urgent issues
* Project management software for task tracking and updates.

**7.2 Communication Channels:**  The project will utilize a combination of email, project management software, and regular meetings to ensure effective communication.

**8. Risk Management**

**8.1 Risk Identification:** Potential risks include:

* Delays in AI provider API access.
* Unexpected technical challenges.
* Difficulty in generating high-quality documents.
* Resource constraints.


**8.2 Risk Response Planning:** Mitigation strategies will be developed for each identified risk.  These strategies might include contingency planning, risk transfer, or risk avoidance.

**9. Procurement Management**

**9.1 Procurement Strategy:**  This section will detail any necessary procurement activities, including contracts with AI providers and potential third-party vendors.

**10. Stakeholder Management**

**10.1 Stakeholder Register:** A stakeholder register will be created, identifying all stakeholders and their interests in the project.

**10.2 Stakeholder Engagement:**  Regular communication and collaboration with stakeholders will be maintained throughout the project lifecycle.

**11. Integration Management**

**11.1 Integration Approach:** The project manager will be responsible for integrating the various project management knowledge areas.  Regular meetings and progress reviews will ensure alignment.

**12. Project Controls and Governance**

**12.1 Change Control:** A formal change control process will be implemented to manage any changes to the project scope, schedule, or budget.

**12.2 Performance Reporting:** Regular progress reports will be provided to stakeholders, highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs).

**13. Project Lifecycle and Methodology**

The project will follow an Agile methodology, with iterative development and frequent releases.  This approach will allow for flexibility and adaptation to changing requirements.

**14. Success Criteria and Acceptance**

The project will be considered successful if it meets all the project objectives outlined in section 2.1.  Acceptance criteria will be defined for each deliverable.

**15. Project Closure Plan**

Upon completion of all deliverables and successful UAT, the project will be formally closed.  This will involve final documentation, lessons learned, and a post-implementation review.


This Project Management Plan is a living document and will be updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Regular reviews will ensure the plan remains relevant and effective.
