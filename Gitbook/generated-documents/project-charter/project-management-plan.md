## **2. Project Scope Management Plan**  
### **Scope Statement:**  
The Requirements Gathering Agent project is focused on delivering a Node.js/TypeScript Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool integrated with Azure OpenAI for automated project documentation generation. The tool will support multi-provider AI integrations, enhanced context management, and PMBOK validation capabilities.

### **In-Scope:**  
- Development of AI-powered capabilities for PMBOK documentation generation.  
- CLI interface for document generation, validation, and management.  
- Integration with AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub Copilot, Ollama).  
- Comprehensive testing for compliance and quality assurance.  
- Documentation and tutorials for end-users.  

### **Out-of-Scope:**  
- Development of full-fledged project management software.  
- Support for AI models outside the listed providers.  
- Integration with non-PMBOK frameworks.  

### **Scope Control:**  
- Scope will be controlled through iterative stakeholder engagement, formal documentation reviews, and baseline agreements.  
- Change requests must be submitted via the Change Control Process.

## **3. Requirements Management Plan**  
### **Requirements Collection:**  
Requirements will be gathered through stakeholder workshops, document analysis (e.g., README.md, architecture files, planning documents), and automated context discovery within the project repository.  

### **Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM):**  
The RTM will map requirements to deliverables, ensuring alignment with project objectives and PMBOK standards.  

### **Change Management:**  
Change requests to requirements will be evaluated for feasibility, impact, and alignment with the project goals. Approved changes will be documented in the RTM and the Change Log.
