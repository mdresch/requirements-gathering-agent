# User Stories: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

## Project Overview

The ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent is a revolutionary platform automating enterprise-level business analysis.  It leverages AI to generate BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, stakeholder maps, and regulatory compliance documents in seconds, dramatically reducing the time and effort required for traditional consulting engagements.  The system features a production-ready Express.js API with an API-first design, ensuring scalability and maintainability.  It's validated with Fortune 500-level data and recognized for its transformational impact on the industry.


## Epic: API Functionality

### Document Generation
- **US001:** As a business analyst, I want to upload a JSON file containing project details (stakeholders, objectives, regulations) so that the system generates a BABOK v3 compliant requirements document.
- **US002:** As a project manager, I want to specify the desired output format (e.g., PDF, DOCX, HTML) so that I can easily integrate the generated document into my existing workflows.
- **US003:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the status of document generation jobs in real-time so that I can proactively address any issues.
- **US004:** As a developer, I want the API to return detailed error messages for invalid inputs so that I can quickly identify and correct errors.
- **US005:** As a security officer, I want the API to enforce robust authentication and rate limiting to protect against unauthorized access and abuse.
- **US006:** As a business analyst, I want the system to integrate with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) so that I can choose the best model for my needs and ensure redundancy.
- **US007:** As a data analyst, I want the generated documents to include comprehensive metadata (date, version, AI provider used, etc.) so that I can track and manage the documents effectively.


### Template Management
- **US008:** As a system administrator, I want to create and manage custom templates for document generation so that I can tailor the output to specific project needs.
- **US009:** As a business analyst, I want to be able to select a predefined template from a library of templates so that I can quickly start generating documents.
- **US010:** As a developer, I want the API to validate template data to ensure consistency and compliance with BABOK v3 standards.


## Epic: User Interface (CLI)

- **US011:** As a user, I want a clear and intuitive command-line interface to interact with the API so that I can easily initiate document generation jobs.
- **US012:** As a user, I want the CLI to provide feedback on the status of ongoing jobs so that I can track progress without constantly checking the API.
- **US013:** As a user, I want to be able to configure API keys and other settings through the CLI so that I can customize the system's behavior.


## Epic: Integrations

- **US014:** As a project manager, I want the system to integrate with our existing project management tools (e.g., Jira, Asana) so that I can seamlessly incorporate the generated documents into our workflows.
- **US015:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to automatically incorporate relevant regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, SOX) into the generated documents so that we maintain compliance.
- **US016:** As a system administrator, I want the system to support integration with SharePoint or other document repositories for secure storage and version control.


## Epic: Reporting and Monitoring

- **US017:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logs and monitoring capabilities so that I can track system performance and identify potential issues.
- **US018:** As a project manager, I want to generate reports on document generation metrics (e.g., time taken, AI provider used, etc.) so that I can assess efficiency and identify areas for improvement.


## Acceptance Criteria Framework

Each user story will have specific acceptance criteria defined, including:

* **Given:** [Initial state/context]
* **When:** [User action]
* **Then:** [Expected outcome/system response]


**Example (US001):**

* **Given:** A valid JSON file containing project details is uploaded.
* **When:** The user initiates a document generation job via the API.
* **Then:** The system generates a BABOK v3 compliant requirements document in the specified format within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 2 seconds for smaller projects).  The document accurately reflects the information provided in the JSON input.  The API returns a success status code and a job ID.


## Priority Classification

User stories will be prioritized based on their importance to the MVP and overall functionality.  Priorities will be assigned as High, Medium, or Low.


## Dependencies and Assumptions

- All user stories assume the availability of a stable internet connection.
- Certain user stories may depend on successful completion of other user stories.
- The system's performance will be benchmarked against realistic enterprise-level datasets.


## Definition of Done

A user story is considered "done" when:

- The functionality is fully implemented and tested.
- All acceptance criteria are met.
- Code review is completed.
- Relevant documentation is updated.


This User Stories document provides a comprehensive overview of the functionality planned for the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent.  It will be regularly updated as the project progresses.
