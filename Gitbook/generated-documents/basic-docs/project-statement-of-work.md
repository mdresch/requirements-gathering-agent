# Project Statement of Work: ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Project Overview:**

This project delivers the ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent, a revolutionary platform automating enterprise business analysis. Leveraging an API-first design and cutting-edge AI, it generates BABOK v3 compliant frameworks, stakeholder maps, and regulatory compliance documentation in seconds, significantly reducing time and cost associated with traditional consulting methods.  The platform has achieved industry recognition for its transformative capabilities and technical artistry, validated through successful deployment in a Fortune 500 GlobalBank modernization program.

**2. Project Objectives:**

* Deliver a production-ready Express.js API for generating BABOK v3 compliant business analysis documents.
* Ensure the API adheres to API-first design principles, utilizing TypeSpec for specification and OpenAPI 3.0 for documentation.
* Integrate with multiple AI providers for robust and flexible requirements elicitation.
* Provide comprehensive documentation, including technical implementation details, user guides, and business impact analysis.
* Achieve a 90% reduction in time required for requirements gathering compared to traditional methods.
* Maintain 100% BABOK v3 compliance in all generated deliverables.


**3. Scope of Work:**

The project encompasses the following key deliverables:

* **Production-Ready API:** A fully functional and tested Express.js API deployed to a production-ready environment (details to be specified).  This includes robust error handling, authentication (API key and potentially JWT), rate limiting, and input validation.
* **TypeSpec & OpenAPI Specifications:** Comprehensive API specifications using TypeSpec and OpenAPI 3.0, ensuring API-first design excellence and easy integration.
* **BABOK v3 Framework Generation:**  The core functionality of generating complete, compliant BABOK v3 frameworks based on provided input data (JSON format).  This includes stakeholder analysis, requirements elicitation, and regulatory compliance integration (Basel III, MiFID II, GDPR, SOX).
* **Multi-Format Output:**  Support for generating deliverables in multiple formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, HTML).
* **Comprehensive Documentation:**  A complete suite of documentation, including API specifications, user manuals, developer guides, deployment instructions, and business case studies demonstrating the value proposition.
* **Testing and Quality Assurance:**  Rigorous testing procedures, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance testing, to ensure high quality and stability.


**4. Deliverables:**

* Fully functional and tested ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent API deployed to a specified environment.
* Complete TypeSpec and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.
* User documentation (including quick start guides and tutorials).
* Developer documentation (including API reference, code examples, and architecture diagrams).
* Deployment guide.
* Test reports and quality assurance documentation.
* Business case studies demonstrating successful deployments.
