# Key Roles and Needs

**Project:** ADPA Requirements Gathering Agent - Enterprise BABOK Framework API

This document outlines the key roles involved in the ADPA project and their respective needs.  The project's revolutionary nature necessitates a clear understanding of these needs to ensure successful implementation and ongoing support.

## I. Key Roles

The project's success hinges on the effective collaboration of several key roles:

**A. Development Team:**

* **Role:** Responsible for designing, developing, testing, and deploying the ADPA API and associated infrastructure. This includes backend development (Express.js, TypeScript), API design (OpenAPI 3.0, TypeSpec), database management, and deployment automation.  Sub-teams may exist for specific areas like AI integration or front-end development (if applicable).
* **Needs:** Access to development environments, appropriate software licenses, clear technical specifications, regular code reviews, robust testing frameworks, and effective communication channels for collaboration.  They require a deep understanding of BABOK v3, PMBOK (if applicable), and relevant regulatory compliance frameworks.  Access to and expertise in using multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google AI, etc.) is critical.

**B. Product Owner:**

* **Role:** Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, manages the product backlog, and ensures the product meets the needs of its target users (enterprise business analysts).
* **Needs:**  Clear understanding of the target market and their needs, access to market research data, effective communication with stakeholders, tools for managing the product backlog, and regular feedback mechanisms from users and the development team.  They must possess a strong understanding of the business analysis landscape and the value proposition of the ADPA platform.

**C. Business Analysts (Internal & External):**

* **Role:** (Internal) Collaborate with the product owner to define requirements and user stories. (External)  Serve as beta testers and provide feedback on the platform's usability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios (e.g., Fortune 500 companies).
* **Needs:**  Early access to the platform, clear documentation and training materials, opportunities to provide feedback and suggestions, and a mechanism for reporting bugs and issues.  For external analysts, compensation arrangements and non-disclosure agreements are necessary.

**D. Project Manager:**

* **Role:** Manages the project timeline, budget, and resources, ensuring the project stays on track and within scope.
* **Needs:**  Clear project scope and objectives, access to project management tools, regular status reports from the development team, and effective communication with stakeholders.  A strong understanding of agile methodologies and risk management is crucial.

**E. Security Team:**

* **Role:** Ensures the security and compliance of the ADPA API and associated infrastructure, including authentication, authorization, data protection, and vulnerability management.
* **Needs:**  Access to security testing tools, clear security requirements and guidelines, regular security audits, and opportunities to collaborate with the development team to address security concerns.  Expertise in relevant security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, SOX) is essential.

**F. Legal & Compliance Team:**

* **Role:** Ensures the project complies with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including data privacy, intellectual property, and contract law.
* **Needs:**  Access to legal documentation, clear guidelines on data privacy and security, and regular updates on relevant legal and regulatory changes.
