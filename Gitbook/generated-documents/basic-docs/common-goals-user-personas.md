2. **Business Analyst (BA):** Focuses on requirements gathering and analysis. Needs a tool that facilitates clear requirements capture, documentation, and traceability. High priority on accuracy, completeness, and collaboration.

3. **Technical Lead/Architect:** Responsible for the technical design and implementation. Requires detailed technical documentation for system architecture, API specifications, etc. High priority on accuracy, detail, and ease of use for technical documentation generation.

4. **Stakeholder (e.g., Executive, Client):**  Needs high-level, easily understandable documents to track progress and understand project status. High priority on clear, concise communication and executive-ready materials.

5. **Quality Assurance (QA) Specialist:** Responsible for ensuring document quality and compliance. Needs a tool that provides validation and quality assessment reports. High priority on compliance, accuracy, and consistency.


## Common Goals Analysis

While each persona has specific needs, several common goals emerge:
