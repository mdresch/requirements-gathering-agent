## Security Testing Guidelines: ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant)

**1. Introduction**

These guidelines outline the security testing approach for the ADPA project, focusing on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities within the application and its infrastructure.  The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its generated data.

**2. Security Testing Scope**

The security testing will encompass the following areas:

* **Application Code:**  Static and dynamic analysis of the TypeScript application codebase, including the CLI, API endpoints (if applicable), and internal modules.  This includes all components involved in document generation, context management, and AI provider integration.
* **Infrastructure:** Assessment of the deployment environment (e.g., Azure infrastructure) including network security, access control, and data storage.  This includes evaluating the security of Azure OpenAI integration and any other cloud-based services used.
* **Data Handling:**  Review of data handling practices, including the processing, storage, and transmission of user input, project data, and generated documents.  Focus will be on data confidentiality, integrity, and protection against unauthorized access or modification.
* **Third-Party Components:** Security review of all third-party libraries and dependencies used in the project, ensuring they are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.  This includes analysis of the OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama SDKs.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** Comprehensive testing of the authentication and authorization mechanisms used for accessing the application and its underlying APIs, including Azure Entra ID integration.
* **API Security (if applicable):** If ADPA exposes any APIs, thorough testing of API security will be performed, including input validation, authentication, authorization, and protection against common API vulnerabilities (OWASP API Security Top 10).
* **Version Control System Integration:** Security assessment of the integrated Git version control system, focusing on access control, data integrity, and protection against unauthorized code changes.


**3. Testing Methodology**

A combination of testing methodologies will be employed:

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Automated analysis of the source code to identify potential vulnerabilities without executing the code. Tools like SonarQube or similar will be used.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Automated testing of the running application to identify vulnerabilities during runtime. Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite will be used.
* **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST):**  Combines SAST and DAST techniques to provide more accurate and context-aware vulnerability detection.
* **Penetration Testing:** Manual and automated attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the application and its infrastructure. This will involve various attack vectors, including network attacks, injection attacks, and exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
* **Security Code Review:** Manual inspection of the application code to identify security flaws and ensure adherence to secure coding practices.
* **Configuration Review:**  Review of all configuration files to ensure secure settings and adherence to security best practices.


**4. Security Controls**

The following security controls will be considered during the assessment:

* **Input Validation:**  Thorough validation of all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injection).
* **Authentication and Authorization:**  Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the application and its resources.  This includes secure storage of credentials and proper role-based access control (RBAC).
* **Data Encryption:**  Encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest, using industry-standard encryption algorithms.
* **Access Control:**  Restriction of access to sensitive data and resources based on the principle of least privilege.
* **Logging and Monitoring:**  Implementation of comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
* **Error Handling:** Secure handling of errors to prevent information leakage and avoid vulnerabilities.
* **Vulnerability Management:**  Regular scanning for vulnerabilities and patching known security flaws.
* **Regular Security Updates:**  Keeping all software components, including the application, libraries, and infrastructure, up-to-date with the latest security patches.


**5. Vulnerability Assessment**

Vulnerability assessments will be performed using automated tools and manual analysis to identify potential security weaknesses.  This will include:

* **Network Scanning:** Identify open ports, vulnerabilities in network devices, and misconfigurations.
* **Web Application Scanning:**  Detect common web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10).
* **Code Analysis:** Identify security flaws in the application code.
* **Configuration Analysis:** Identify insecure configurations in the application and infrastructure.


**6. Penetration Testing**

Penetration testing will involve simulated attacks against the application and infrastructure to assess their resilience to real-world threats.  This will include:

* **Black Box Testing:** Testing without prior knowledge of the system.
* **White Box Testing:** Testing with access to the source code and internal documentation.
* **Grey Box Testing:** A combination of black box and white box testing.
* **Network Penetration Testing:**  Testing the network infrastructure for vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Penetration Testing:**  Testing the web application for vulnerabilities.
* **API Penetration Testing (if applicable):**  Testing the APIs (if any) for vulnerabilities.


**7. Security Tools**

The following tools may be used during the security testing process:

* **SAST Tools:** SonarQube, Coverity, etc.
* **DAST Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Acunetix, etc.
* **IAST Tools:** Contrast Security, etc.
* **Network Scanning Tools:** Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS, etc.
* **Vulnerability Scanners:** QualysGuard, Tenable.sc, etc.


**8. Test Environment**

Testing will be conducted in a dedicated environment that closely mirrors the production environment.  This ensures that the findings are relevant and applicable to the live system.  Data used in the testing environment will be anonymized or synthetic.


**9. Reporting Format**

The security testing report will follow a standardized format, including:

* **Executive Summary:**  A high-level overview of the findings.
* **Methodology:**  A description of the testing methodology used.
* **Vulnerabilities:** A detailed list of identified vulnerabilities, including their severity, location, and potential impact.
* **Remediation Recommendations:**  Specific recommendations for fixing the identified vulnerabilities.
* **Risk Assessment:**  An assessment of the overall security risk posed by the identified vulnerabilities.


**10. Risk Assessment**

A risk assessment will be performed to evaluate the likelihood and impact of each identified vulnerability. This will use a standardized risk matrix to prioritize remediation efforts.  The risk assessment will consider factors such as the vulnerability's severity, exploitability, and the potential impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.


**11. Remediation Process**

A clear remediation process will be established to address identified vulnerabilities. This process will include:

* **Prioritization:**  Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on their risk level.
* **Remediation:**  Developing and implementing fixes for identified vulnerabilities.
* **Verification:**  Verifying that the implemented fixes have resolved the vulnerabilities.
* **Documentation:** Documenting all remediation activities.


**12. Compliance with Security Standards**

The security testing will adhere to relevant security standards and best practices, such as OWASP, NIST, and industry-specific regulations.  The specific standards will be defined based on the project's requirements and risk profile.  This will include consideration of GDPR and other data privacy regulations if applicable.

This document serves as a high-level overview. A more detailed security testing plan will be developed based on the specific requirements of the ADPA project.
