# ADPA Test Environment Setup Guide

This guide outlines the setup and configuration of a test environment for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA).  The goal is to provide a consistent and repeatable environment for testing various aspects of the application, including functionality, performance, and scalability.

## 1. Environment Overview

The ADPA test environment will mirror the production environment as closely as possible. This ensures that testing results accurately reflect real-world performance.  We will utilize a virtualized infrastructure to enable easy replication and management of the test environment.  Specific cloud provider (Azure, GCP, AWS, etc.) will be chosen based on project needs and resource availability.  The choice will be documented in the project's configuration files.

## 2. Hardware Requirements

The hardware requirements for the test environment will depend on the scale of testing.  For initial testing and smaller scale tests, a single virtual machine with the following specifications will suffice:

* **CPU:** 4 vCPUs (or equivalent)
* **Memory:** 16 GB RAM
* **Storage:** 100 GB SSD (or equivalent)
* **Network:** 1 Gbps network connectivity

For larger-scale performance and load testing, multiple virtual machines will be provisioned, scaling resources proportionally to the expected load. This will be documented in a separate performance testing plan.

## 3. Software Requirements

The following software components are required for the ADPA test environment:

* **Operating System:**  A Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu Server) is recommended for its stability and compatibility with the application's dependencies.  The specific version should be consistent with the production environment.
* **Node.js:** Version 18.0.0 or higher, matching the version specified in the project's `package.json`.
* **npm (or yarn):** Package manager for installing project dependencies.
* **Git:** Version control system for managing code and configurations.
* **Docker (Optional):** For containerizing the application and its dependencies.  This will improve portability and consistency across different testing environments.
* **Monitoring Tools:**  Tools like Prometheus and Grafana will be used to monitor the application's performance and resource utilization during testing. (Optional, but highly recommended for performance and load testing).
* **AI Provider SDKs:** The SDKs for the chosen AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) must be installed and configured correctly.  See Section 7 for details on authentication.


## 4. Network Configuration

The test environment should have access to the internet for accessing AI services and other external dependencies.  Firewall rules should be configured to allow necessary network traffic.  For security reasons, consider a dedicated virtual network for the test environment, isolated from the production network.

## 5. Database Setup

ADPA doesn't explicitly require a database for basic functionality.  However, future enhancements might require database integration.  If needed, a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) will be provisioned and configured according to the specifications outlined in the database design document.  For testing, a lightweight in-memory database or a local instance can be used.

## 6. Test Data Management

Test data is crucial for effective testing.  The following strategies will be employed:

* **Synthetic Data Generation:**  Tools and scripts will be developed to generate realistic synthetic data that covers a wide range of scenarios and edge cases.
* **Subset of Production Data:** A sanitized subset of production data can be used for testing, provided it adheres to all data privacy and security regulations.
* **Data Masking:** Sensitive information in the production data subset will be masked to protect privacy.

The test data management plan will detail the specific strategy and procedures for creating, managing, and securing test data.

## 7. Access Control

Access to the test environment will be strictly controlled using role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms.  Only authorized personnel will have access to the environment and its resources.  This will be managed through the cloud provider's IAM system or similar mechanisms.

## 8. Monitoring Setup

Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.) will be configured to collect metrics on the application's performance, resource utilization, and error rates.  Dashboards will be created to visualize key metrics and provide insights into the application's behavior during testing.  This is crucial for performance and load testing.  Alerting mechanisms will be configured to notify relevant personnel of critical issues.

## 9. Backup Procedures

Regular backups of the test environment will be performed to protect against data loss.  The backup frequency and retention policy will be defined based on the risk assessment.  The backup strategy will include both full and incremental backups.

## 10. Troubleshooting Guide

A comprehensive troubleshooting guide will be developed to address common issues encountered during test environment setup and execution.  This guide will include detailed steps for resolving errors and identifying the root causes of problems.

## 11.  AI Provider Authentication

This section details authentication for each supported AI provider:

* **Azure OpenAI:** Authentication will be managed using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or API keys, depending on the chosen deployment method.  Environment variables will store sensitive credentials.  See the project's `README.md` for details on configuring Azure OpenAI credentials.

* **Google AI:**  Authentication will be handled using API keys obtained from Google AI Studio.  These keys will be stored securely as environment variables.  See the project's `README.md` for details.

* **GitHub AI:**  Authentication will utilize GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs).  These tokens will be stored securely as environment variables.  See the project's `README.md` for details.

* **Ollama:** Ollama requires local setup and configuration.  Refer to the Ollama documentation for details.


## 12.  Deployment and Setup Steps

1. **Provision Infrastructure:** Create the necessary virtual machines and network resources in the chosen cloud provider.
2. **Install OS and Dependencies:** Install the operating system and required software components (Node.js, npm, Git, Docker (optional)).
3. **Clone Repository:** Clone the ADPA repository using Git.
4. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies using `npm install`.
5. **Configure Environment Variables:** Set the necessary environment variables for AI provider authentication and other configurations (see Section 11).
6. **Run the Application:** Start the ADPA application using the appropriate command (e.g., `npm start`).
7. **Configure Monitoring:** Set up monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) to collect and visualize key metrics.
8. **Populate Test Data:** Generate or import test data according to the test data management plan.

This guide provides a foundation for setting up the ADPA test environment.  Specific details and configurations may vary depending on the project's requirements and the chosen technologies.  Regular review and updates to this guide are essential to maintain its relevance and accuracy.
