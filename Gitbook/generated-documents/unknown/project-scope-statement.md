## Project Scope Statement: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the scope of the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, defining what will be delivered and what is excluded.  The RGA is an AI-powered tool designed to generate comprehensive PMBOK 7th Edition-compliant project management documentation from project README files and associated documentation.

**2. Project Objectives**

The primary objectives of the RGA project are to:

* Develop a command-line interface (CLI) tool that automatically generates PMBOK 7th Edition-compliant project documentation.
* Integrate with multiple AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) to leverage their large language models (LLMs).
* Implement a robust project analysis engine to discover and prioritize relevant project information from various sources beyond the README file (e.g., requirements documents, architecture diagrams, stakeholder information).
* Ensure generated documents are accurate, consistent, and meet quality standards.
* Provide comprehensive validation and quality assessment features, including PMBOK 7.0 compliance checks.
* Deliver a user-friendly tool with clear instructions and documentation.

**3. Project Deliverables**

The project will deliver the following:

* **RGA CLI Tool:** A fully functional command-line application for generating project documentation.  This includes installation scripts and comprehensive documentation.
* **Project Documentation Generator Engine:**  The core logic responsible for processing project information and generating documents.
* **AI Provider Integrations:**  Fully functional integrations with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.
* **Project Analysis Engine:**  A module capable of discovering and analyzing relevant project documentation, including markdown files and other project metadata.
* **PMBOK 7th Edition Document Templates:**  Templates for generating all relevant PMBOK documents (minimum 29 as specified in the project README).
* **Validation and Quality Assessment Module:**  A module for validating generated documents against PMBOK standards and providing quality scores.
* **User Documentation:**  Comprehensive user guides and tutorials.


**4. Project Exclusions**

The following are explicitly excluded from the scope of this project:

* **Integration with third-party project management software:** While a modular architecture will support future integration, this is not part of the initial release.
* **GUI Development:** The project will focus on a CLI tool; a graphical user interface (GUI) is not included in this scope.
* **Custom AI Model Training:** The project will utilize pre-trained LLMs from the specified providers; training a custom model is outside the scope.
* **Ongoing maintenance and support beyond initial release:**  Post-release support will be defined separately.
* **Specific customization of generated documents beyond PMBOK 7th edition standards:** While the tool will aim for maximum accuracy and completeness, extensive custom tailoring of each document's content is outside the scope.


**5. Acceptance Criteria**

The project will be considered complete and accepted when:

* The RGA CLI tool successfully generates all specified PMBOK documents.
* The generated documents meet the defined quality standards and pass PMBOK compliance checks.
* The tool successfully integrates with all specified AI providers.
* User documentation is complete and accurate.
* All planned unit and integration tests pass.


**6.  Assumptions and Constraints**

* **Assumptions:**  The project assumes readily available access to the specified AI provider APIs and sufficient project documentation to inform document generation.
* **Constraints:** The project is constrained by the available time, budget, and resources.  Specific deadlines and resource allocations will be defined in the project schedule.


**7.  Stakeholders**

Key stakeholders include:

* Project Sponsor
* Project Manager
* Development Team
* End-users (Project Managers, Business Analysts)


This Project Scope Statement serves as a baseline for the project and will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the project lifecycle.  Any changes to the scope will be formally documented and approved through the established change management process.
