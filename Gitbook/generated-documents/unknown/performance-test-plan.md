## Performance Test Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the performance testing plan for the ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant) application.  The goal is to ensure ADPA meets performance requirements under various load conditions, providing a smooth and responsive experience for users.  This plan addresses load testing, focusing on the API calls to Azure OpenAI and the overall application response times.

**2. Performance Testing Goals**

* **Objective 1:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent users ADPA can support while maintaining acceptable response times.
* **Objective 2:** Identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization within the application.
* **Objective 3:** Validate that ADPA meets predefined performance Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for key functionalities.  These SLAs will be defined in Section 7.
* **Objective 4:** Assess the scalability of ADPA's architecture and identify potential scaling limitations.


**3. Test Scenarios**

The following scenarios will be tested:

* **Scenario 1:  Document Generation (various document types):**  This scenario will focus on the time taken to generate different document types (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Risk Register, etc.) under varying user loads.  Different document complexities will be considered.
* **Scenario 2:  Comprehensive Generation:** This scenario will test the generation of the entire PMBOK document suite simultaneously.
* **Scenario 3:  API Call Performance (Azure OpenAI):** This scenario will isolate and measure the performance of API calls to Azure OpenAI.  This will help identify bottlenecks in the interaction with the AI provider.
* **Scenario 4:  High-Volume Context Analysis:** This will test the performance of the context analysis engine with large README files and diverse supporting documentation.
* **Scenario 5:  Version Control System (VCS) Operations:** This scenario will test the performance of VCS commands (log, diff, revert, etc.) under load.


**4. Load Profiles**

The following load profiles will be used:

* **Light Load:** 10 concurrent users
* **Medium Load:** 50 concurrent users
* **Heavy Load:** 100 concurrent users
* **Peak Load:** 200 concurrent users (and potentially higher, depending on initial results)

Each load profile will be sustained for a duration of 30 minutes to observe sustained performance under load.  Ramp-up periods will be included to simulate realistic user login patterns.

**5. Test Environment**

The test environment will mirror the production environment as closely as possible, including:

* **Hardware:**  Specifications matching or exceeding production hardware.  Details to be provided in a separate document.
* **Software:**  Identical versions of ADPA, Azure OpenAI SDK, and other relevant software components.
* **Network:**  Network configuration similar to production, including bandwidth and latency.
* **Database:**  Database server configuration mirroring production.  This includes sufficient resources to handle the anticipated load.


**6. Test Data**

Test data will include:

* **README.md files:**  A range of README files of varying sizes and complexities, reflecting real-world project descriptions.
* **Supporting Documentation:**  A variety of supporting documents (markdown, JSON, etc.) to simulate a realistic project context.
* **User Accounts:**  Sufficient user accounts to support the load profiles.


**7. Performance Metrics**

The following metrics will be collected and analyzed:

* **Response Time:** The time taken to generate documents for each scenario.  This will be measured as average, median, 90th percentile, and maximum response times.
* **Throughput:** The number of documents generated per unit of time.
* **Error Rate:** The percentage of failed requests.
* **CPU Utilization:** CPU usage of the application server.
* **Memory Utilization:** Memory consumption of the application server.
* **Database Response Time:** Response times for database queries.
* **Azure OpenAI API Response Time:**  Response times for API calls to Azure OpenAI.
* **Resource Utilization (Azure OpenAI):**  Resource consumption on the Azure OpenAI side (tokens used, processing time).


**Service Level Agreements (SLAs):**

* **Average Response Time (Document Generation):**  Less than 5 seconds for individual document generation (Scenarios 1 & 2), under medium load.
* **Error Rate:** Less than 1% for all scenarios.
* **Azure OpenAI API Response Time:** Less than 2 seconds, under medium load.


**8. Test Tools**

The following tools will be used:

* **JMeter:** For load generation.
* **Grafana/Prometheus:** For monitoring server metrics (CPU, memory, etc.).
* **New Relic/Datadog:** (Optional) For more comprehensive application performance monitoring.
* **Azure Monitor:** For monitoring Azure OpenAI API usage and performance.


**9. Test Schedule**

A detailed test schedule will be created and shared separately, outlining specific test execution dates and timelines.  The schedule will account for test environment setup, test data preparation, test execution, analysis, and reporting.


**10. Resource Requirements**

* **Test Engineers:** 2 experienced performance test engineers.
* **Test Environment:**  Dedicated hardware and software resources.
* **Test Data:**  Preparation of representative README files and supporting documents.
* **Tools:**  Licensing for performance testing and monitoring tools.


**11. Success Criteria**

The performance tests will be considered successful if:

* All defined SLAs are met.
* No critical performance bottlenecks are identified.
* Recommendations for optimization are provided.
* A comprehensive performance test report is generated.


**12. Reporting**

A comprehensive performance test report will be generated, including:

* Summary of test results.
* Detailed analysis of performance metrics.
* Identification of performance bottlenecks.
* Recommendations for optimization.
* Assessment of scalability.


**13. Risk Assessment and Mitigation**

* **Risk 1:  Insufficient Test Environment Resources:**  Mitigation:  Provision sufficient hardware and software resources for the test environment.
* **Risk 2:  Unexpected Azure OpenAI API Performance Issues:**  Mitigation:  Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms.  Closely monitor Azure OpenAI API performance during testing.
* **Risk 3:  Inadequate Test Data:**  Mitigation:  Develop a comprehensive test data strategy that accurately represents real-world usage patterns.

This plan will be reviewed and updated as needed throughout the testing process.
