## Test Case Specifications: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

This document outlines the test case specifications for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA).  The tests are categorized to cover functional, non-functional, and security aspects of the application.

**1. Test Case Structure:**

| Test Case ID | Test Case Name | Category | Description | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Results | Pass/Fail Criteria | Test Data Requirements | Test Environment | Test Dependencies |  Traceability Matrix (Requirement ID) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TC_001 | Successful PMBOK Document Generation | Functional | Verify generation of all PMBOK documents from a valid README. | ADPA installed, valid README file provided. | 1. Run `requirements-gathering-agent`. 2. Verify the creation of the `generated-documents` directory. 3. Check for the existence of all expected PMBOK documents within the directory. | All 29 PMBOK documents are generated successfully and are complete. | All 29 PMBOK documents are present and complete. | A valid README file with sufficient project information. | Node.js environment, Azure OpenAI (or alternative) configured. | None | FR-2 |


**2. Test Case Categories:**

* **Functional Testing:**  These tests verify the core functionalities of ADPA, such as document generation, PMBOK validation, and CLI command execution.  Examples include:
    * Successful document generation for various document types (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, etc.).
    * Correct handling of various input formats (Markdown, JSON).
    * Successful PMBOK validation with detailed reports.
    * Accurate CLI command execution for different options (e.g., `--core-only`, `--validate-pmbok`).
    * Successful generation of strategic documents (Purpose Statement, Company Values).
    * Version control system functionality (commit, log, diff, revert, push, pull).
    * Modular processor architecture functionality: ability to add/remove processors.

* **Non-Functional Testing:** These tests assess the performance, usability, and security aspects of ADPA. Examples include:
    * Performance testing (response time, resource utilization) for different input sizes.
    * Usability testing (ease of use, intuitive CLI, clear documentation).
    * Security testing (authentication, authorization, data protection).
    * Stress testing (handling large input files, high concurrent requests).
    * Scalability testing (handling increasing project size).
    * Reliability testing (error handling, retry mechanism).
    * Compatibility testing (different operating systems, AI providers).


* **Security Testing:** This category focuses on vulnerabilities and data protection. Examples include:
    * Authentication and authorization testing for different AI providers.
    * Input validation to prevent injection attacks.
    * Data encryption and protection during transit and at rest.
    * Secure handling of API keys and sensitive information.
    * Testing for common vulnerabilities and exposures (OWASP Top 10).


**3. Test Data Requirements:**

* **Valid README files:**  A range of README files with varying levels of complexity and information density will be used.  Some will be minimal, others will include extensive project details.
* **Invalid README files:**  Files with incorrect formatting, missing information, or invalid data.
* **Large README files:**  Files exceeding the typical size to test the system's scalability.
* **Various project structures:**  Different directory structures to test the intelligent source discovery mechanism.
* **Test configurations:**  Different AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) and configurations.


**4. Preconditions:**

* ADPA is installed correctly.
* The necessary environment variables (API keys, endpoints) are configured correctly.
* The required dependencies are installed.
* The test environment is set up.

**5. Test Steps (Examples):**

**(Refer to TC_001 for a basic example.  More detailed steps would be included for each specific test case.)**

**6. Expected Results (Examples):**

**(Refer to TC_001 for a basic example. Specific expected results, including file contents, validation reports, etc., would be detailed for each test case.)**


**7. Pass/Fail Criteria:**

* A test case passes if all expected results are met.
* A test case fails if any of the expected results are not met.


**8. Test Environment:**

* Operating system:  [Specify OS versions - e.g., Windows 10, macOS Ventura, Ubuntu 22.04]
* Node.js version: [Specify version - e.g., v18.16.0]
* AI Provider: [Specify - e.g., Azure OpenAI, Google AI]
* Database (if applicable): [Specify database and version]


**9. Test Dependencies:**

* [List any dependencies between test cases, if any]


**10. Traceability Matrix:**

This matrix links test cases to specific requirements (functional, non-functional) from the project requirements document.  (See example in TC_001).  A comprehensive matrix would be created covering all test cases and their associated requirements.


**Note:** This is a template.  Many more test cases would need to be created to achieve comprehensive test coverage.  The number of test cases will depend on the complexity of the application and the level of testing required.  Each test case would be fully fleshed out with detailed steps, expected results, and data requirements.  The traceability matrix needs to be expanded to cover all requirements and test cases.
