# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) - Requirements Gathering Agent Project

This RTM traces requirements from their origin to their verification and validation.  It uses a subset of the requirements identified in the provided documentation for brevity, but the structure can easily accommodate all requirements.

| Requirement ID | Requirement Description                                                                          | Requirement Type | Priority | Source                               | Success Criteria                                                                        | Test Case Reference | Verification Method             | Status |

**Note:** TC- refers to Test Case.  This is a simplified example; a real-world RTM would contain far more detailed test cases and potentially more verification methods.  The "Source" column points to the document or stakeholder where the requirement originated.  The "Status" column reflects the current state of requirement verification.
