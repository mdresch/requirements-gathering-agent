**Test Plan: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)**

**1. Introduction**

1.1 **Purpose:** This document outlines the test plan for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) application, version 2.1.3-prerelease.  It details the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for verifying and validating the functionality, performance, and security of the application.

1.2 **Scope:** This test plan covers all features listed in the project README, including:  strategic document generation (purpose statement, company values, etc.), PMBOK document suite generation, enhanced project analysis, intelligent context management, version control system integration, and multi-AI provider support (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  Specific focus will be on the newly added features and bug fixes outlined in the project changelog.

1.3 **References:**

* Project README: [Link to Project README]
* Project Changelog: [Link to Project Changelog]
* Requirements Document: [Link to Requirements Document, if available. Otherwise, reference relevant sections within the README]
* Architecture Document: [Link to Architecture Document, if available. Otherwise, reference relevant sections within the README]

**2. Test Items**

2.1 **Software Under Test (SUT):** ADPA application, version 2.1.3-prerelease.

2.2 **Test Environment:**  The testing will be conducted across multiple environments:

* **Development Environment:**  [Specify details of the development environment]
* **Staging Environment:** [Specify details of the staging environment]
* **Production-like Environment:** [Specify details of the production-like environment, mirroring production as closely as possible]

2.3 **Hardware and Software Requirements:**  [List hardware and software requirements for each environment, including OS versions, memory, processor, and any specific libraries or dependencies.]

**3. Features to be Tested**

3.1 **Functionality:**

* **Document Generation:** Verification of all document types (PMBOK documents, strategic statements) for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to PMBOK 7.0 standards and specified templates.  Testing will include various input README files and project structures to ensure robustness.
* **Project Analysis:** Validation of the intelligent source discovery and relevance scoring mechanisms.  Testing will involve projects with varying complexity and documentation structures.
* **Context Management:** Verification of the Enhanced Context Manager's functionality, including 3-phase context strategy, large model optimization (Gemini 1.5 Pro, etc.), and context utilization reporting.
* **AI Provider Integration:** Testing of all supported AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama) for successful document generation and error handling.  This includes testing fallback mechanisms.
* **Version Control System (VCS):** Verification of the integrated VCS functionality, including automatic versioning, commit history, diffs, and CLI commands.
* **CLI:** Testing of all CLI commands for correct functionality, error handling, and output formats.
* **Error Handling:** Testing of error handling mechanisms for various scenarios, including invalid inputs, API failures, and unexpected exceptions.
* **Security:**  [Specify security tests, such as authentication and authorization testing for API calls and data handling.]

3.2 **Performance:**

* **Execution Time:** Measurement of the time taken to generate documents of varying sizes and complexity.
* **Resource Utilization:** Monitoring of CPU usage, memory consumption, and network traffic during document generation.
* **Scalability:** Testing of the application's ability to handle large projects and extensive documentation.

3.3 **Usability:**

* **Ease of Use:** Assessment of the CLI's user-friendliness and intuitiveness.
* **Clarity of Output:** Evaluation of the clarity and readability of the generated documents.

3.4 **Compatibility:**

* **Operating Systems:** Testing on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
* **AI Provider Versions:** Testing with different versions of the supported AI providers.

**4. Testing Tasks**

4.1 **Test Design Techniques:**  A combination of techniques will be used, including:

* **Black-box testing:** Functional testing, UI testing, integration testing, and system testing.
* **White-box testing:** Unit testing (of individual modules), code review.
* **Performance testing:** Load testing, stress testing, endurance testing.
* **Security testing:** Penetration testing, vulnerability scanning.


4.2 **Test Cases:**  Detailed test cases will be developed for each feature to be tested.  These will include:

* **Input Data:**  A range of README files and project structures will be used as input.
* **Expected Output:** The expected output for each test case will be clearly defined.
* **Pass/Fail Criteria:**  Clear criteria will be defined to determine whether a test case has passed or failed.


4.3 **Test Data:**  Representative data sets will be created to cover various scenarios and edge cases.
