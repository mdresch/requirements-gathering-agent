# Requirements Documentation: Requirements Gathering Agent

**1. Introduction and Purpose**

This document outlines the requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project, a software tool designed to automate the generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documentation using AI.  The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive and unambiguous description of the RGA's functionality, performance characteristics, and constraints to guide development, testing, and acceptance.  This document adheres to PMBOK 7th Edition standards.

**2. Functional Requirements**

The RGA shall:

* **2.1. Input Processing:**
    * 2.1.1. Accept a project's README.md file as primary input.
    * 2.1.2.  Intelligently discover and process additional markdown files within specified directories (e.g., `requirements/`, `docs/`, `specs/`).
    * 2.1.3. Analyze discovered files for relevance to project management, scoring each file based on content, location, and naming conventions (0-100 score).
    * 2.1.4. Prioritize high-scoring files for context building.
    * 2.1.5. Support various project directory structures.
    * 2.1.6.  Handle different markdown file formats and structures.
    * 2.1.7. Identify and handle potential errors during file processing (e.g., missing files, invalid formats).

* **2.2. AI Integration:**
    * 2.2.1. Integrate with specified AI providers (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
    * 2.2.2. Support authentication methods for each AI provider (API keys, Entra ID, etc.).
    * 2.2.3.  Utilize the selected AI model's capabilities for optimal context utilization (up to 90% for large models).
    * 2.2.4. Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for AI API calls.

* **2.3. Document Generation:**
    * 2.3.1. Generate a comprehensive suite of PMBOK-compliant documents (minimum 29 documents as specified in the project README).
    * 2.3.2.  Organize generated documents into a well-structured directory.
    * 2.3.3.  Support multiple output formats (Markdown, JSON, YAML).
    * 2.3.4.  Ensure consistency of terminology and style across all generated documents.
    * 2.3.5.  Include cross-references between related documents where appropriate.

* **2.4. Validation and Quality Assurance:**
    * 2.4.1. Validate generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
    * 2.4.2.  Provide a quality assessment score (0-100) for each generated document.
    * 2.4.3.  Generate detailed reports highlighting compliance issues and areas for improvement.
    * 2.4.4.  Perform cross-document consistency checks.

* **2.5. Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    * 2.5.1. Provide a user-friendly CLI for generating documents, configuring settings, and running validation checks.
    * 2.5.2. Support various command-line options for customizing the generation process (e.g., specific document types, output format, AI provider).


**3. Non-Functional Requirements**

* **3.1. Performance:** The RGA shall generate documents within a reasonable timeframe (to be defined based on testing).  The system should be responsive to user input via the CLI.
* **3.2. Security:** The RGA shall securely handle API keys and authentication credentials, protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.  Data transmission to and from AI providers must be encrypted.
* **3.3. Usability:** The CLI shall be intuitive and easy to use, providing clear instructions and feedback to the user.  The generated documents shall be well-formatted and easy to read.
* **3.4. Scalability:** The RGA shall be able to handle projects of varying sizes and complexities, efficiently processing large amounts of input data.
* **3.5. Maintainability:** The RGA's codebase shall be well-documented and easy to maintain, allowing for future enhancements and bug fixes.
* **3.6. Reliability:** The RGA shall be reliable and robust, minimizing downtime and unexpected errors.  Error handling and recovery mechanisms must be implemented effectively.


**4. Stakeholder Requirements**

* **Project Managers:** Need efficient generation of accurate and complete PMBOK-compliant documents.  Require easy-to-use CLI and clear reports.
* **Business Analysts:**  Need a tool that facilitates requirements gathering and documentation.  Require accurate representation of requirements in generated documents.
* **Developers:** Need a well-documented and maintainable codebase.
* **Compliance Officers:** Need assurance that generated documents meet regulatory requirements and PMBOK standards.


**5. Business Requirements**

* Reduce the time and effort required for project documentation creation.
* Improve the accuracy and consistency of project documentation.
* Ensure compliance with PMBOK standards and regulatory requirements.
* Improve stakeholder communication and collaboration.


**6. Assumptions and Constraints**

* The availability and reliability of the chosen AI providers.
* The accuracy of the AI model's output.
* The availability of sufficient computing resources.
* The complexity of the project documentation input.


**7. Requirements Prioritization**

Requirements are prioritized based on their criticality to the core functionality and business value.  High-priority requirements (e.g., AI integration, document generation, PMBOK compliance) will be addressed first.  Medium-priority requirements (e.g., usability enhancements, advanced reporting) will be addressed in subsequent iterations.


**8. Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**

An RTM will be created and maintained throughout the project lifecycle, linking requirements to design specifications, test cases, and implementation details.  This will ensure traceability and facilitate change management.


**9. Approval and Sign-off**
