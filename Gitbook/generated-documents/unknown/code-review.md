## ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant: Code Review Checklist

This checklist is designed for code reviews of the ADPA project, considering its AI-driven nature, PMBOK compliance requirements, and modular architecture.  It emphasizes code quality, security, performance, and maintainability.

**I. Code Review Process:**

* **Reviewer Selection:**  Assign reviewers with relevant expertise (AI, TypeScript, Node.js, PMBOK, Azure services).  Consider pairing senior and junior developers for knowledge transfer.
* **Review Methodology:** Utilize a structured approach (e.g., checklist-driven, issue tracking system).  Prioritize critical sections (AI interaction, context management, document generation).
* **Review Timing:** Conduct reviews promptly after code commits.  Aim for timely feedback to minimize integration conflicts.
* **Communication:** Maintain clear and constructive communication.  Focus on code improvements, not personal criticism.
* **Iteration:** Encourage iterative reviews and revisions.  Multiple passes may be necessary for complex code sections.
* **Sign-off:** Establish a clear sign-off process indicating review completion and approval.


**II. Code Quality Standards:**

* **Coding Style:** Adherence to consistent coding style guidelines (e.g., TypeScript style guide, ESLint rules).
* **Code Readability:** Code is well-structured, easy to understand, and well-commented.  Meaningful variable and function names are used.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling and exception management are implemented throughout the codebase.  Appropriate logging and error reporting mechanisms are in place.
* **Maintainability:** Code is modular, well-organized, and easy to maintain.  Avoid tightly coupled code.
* **Testability:** Code is written with testability in mind.  Unit tests and integration tests are provided to ensure functionality.
* **Type Safety:**  Thorough use of TypeScript types to prevent runtime errors and improve code clarity.
* **Code Complexity:** Avoid overly complex functions and algorithms.  Refactor complex logic into smaller, more manageable units.
* **Code Duplication:** Minimize code duplication by using functions, classes, or other mechanisms for code reuse.


**III. Security Checks:**

* **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure handling of API keys and credentials for AI services (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).  Consider environment variable management and secure configuration practices.
* **Input Validation:** All user inputs and data from external sources are validated to prevent injection attacks.
* **Output Sanitization:**  Sanitize all outputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* **Dependency Management:** Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.  Utilize a dependency management tool (e.g., npm audit) to identify and mitigate security risks.
* **Data Protection:** Ensure proper handling and protection of sensitive data (if any).  Comply with relevant data privacy regulations.


**IV. Performance Checks:**

* **API Calls:** Optimize API calls to AI providers to minimize latency and costs.  Implement caching mechanisms where appropriate.
* **Context Management:** Efficient management of large context windows for AI models.  Avoid unnecessary data processing.
* **Resource Usage:** Monitor CPU, memory, and disk I/O usage.  Optimize code to minimize resource consumption.
* **Asynchronous Operations:**  Use asynchronous operations where possible to prevent blocking and improve performance.
* **Profiling & Benchmarking:**  Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and conduct benchmarking to measure improvements after optimization.


**V. Documentation Requirements:**

* **Code Comments:**  Clear and concise comments explaining complex logic and functionality.
* **API Documentation:**  Generate API documentation (e.g., using JSDoc) to clearly describe functions, parameters, and return values.
* **User Documentation:**  Comprehensive user documentation covering installation, usage, and troubleshooting.
* **Internal Documentation:**  Clear documentation explaining the system architecture, design choices, and implementation details.  (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md are good examples to expand upon.)
* **Changelog:** Maintain a detailed changelog of all changes, including bug fixes, features, and improvements.


**VI. Testing Requirements:**

* **Unit Tests:**  Comprehensive unit tests covering individual functions and modules.  High test coverage is essential.
* **Integration Tests:**  Integration tests verifying the interaction between different modules and components.
* **End-to-End Tests:**  End-to-end tests simulating real-world scenarios to verify the overall functionality.
* **Test Data:**  Use realistic test data to ensure accurate testing.
* **Test Driven Development (TDD):** Consider TDD for critical components to improve code quality and testability.


**VII. Best Practices:**

* **Modular Design:**  Employ a modular design to improve code organization, reusability, and maintainability.  The current modular processor architecture is a good starting point.
* **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion) for improved code design.
* **Design Patterns:**  Use appropriate design patterns where applicable to improve code structure and readability.
* **Version Control:**  Utilize Git for version control, including clear commit messages and branching strategies.
* **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.


**VIII. Common Issues (Based on Project README):**

* **Context Management:**  Ensure efficient handling of large context windows for different AI models.  Address potential issues related to token limits and context truncation.
* **AI Provider Integration:**  Handle potential errors and failures gracefully when interacting with different AI providers.  Implement robust fallback mechanisms.
* **Document Validation:**  Thoroughly validate generated documents against PMBOK standards.  Address inconsistencies and errors.
* **Error Handling:**  Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected crashes and provide helpful error messages.


**IX. Review Tools:**

* **Linters (ESLint):** Enforce coding style and identify potential errors.
* **Static Analysis Tools:**  Detect potential bugs and vulnerabilities.
* **Code Review Platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket):** Facilitate collaboration and track code review progress.
* **Profiling Tools:**  Identify performance bottlenecks.


**X. Sign-off Criteria:**

* All checklist items are addressed.
* All critical bugs and vulnerabilities are fixed.
* Code meets established quality standards.
* Documentation is complete and accurate.
* Reviewers have signed off on the code.


This checklist provides a comprehensive framework for code reviews.  The specific items and their prioritization may need to be adjusted based on the specific context of each code change.  Remember that the goal is to produce high-quality, secure, maintainable, and performant code.
