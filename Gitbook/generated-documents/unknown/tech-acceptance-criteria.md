It adheres to PMBOK 7.0 standards. | Unit & Integration Tests, Manual Review | 100% accuracy, PMBOK 7.0 compliance verified |  |  |
| CG-4 | Generate all PMBOK documents |  The system successfully generates all 29 PMBOK documents as specified in the project documentation. | Integration Test, Manual Review | 100% successful generation of all documents |  |  |
| CG-5 | Generate Strategic Documents (Purpose Statement, Company Values, etc.) |  The generated strategic documents are grammatically correct, professionally written, and accurately reflect the project's context and goals. | Manual Review, Style Guide Check |  Professional quality, accurate reflection of project context |  |  |
| CG-6 | Handle missing or incomplete input | The system gracefully handles missing or incomplete input data, providing informative error messages and defaulting to reasonable values where appropriate. | Unit & Integration Tests |  Informative error messages, sensible defaults |  |  |


**B. Context Management & Analysis:**

| Criterion ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Testing Method | Acceptance Level | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CM-1 | Comprehensive Project Analysis | The system successfully identifies and analyzes all relevant project documents (README, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.) within specified directories. | Integration Test, Log Analysis | 95% of relevant files identified and processed |  |  |
| CM-2 | Relevance Scoring |  The system accurately assigns relevance scores (0-100) to identified documents based on content and context. | Unit & Integration Tests, Manual Review of Scoring |  Scores are logically consistent and reflect document relevance |  |  |
| CM-3 | Enhanced Context Manager (3-Phase Strategy) | The Enhanced Context Manager successfully implements the three-phase context strategy, adapting to different AI model capabilities and maximizing context utilization. | Integration Test, Log Analysis, Performance Monitoring |  Context utilization reaches target levels for each model type.  |  |  |
| CM-4 | Large Context Model Support | The system effectively utilizes the large context windows (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro's 2M tokens) of supported AI models. | Performance Testing, Log Analysis |  90% context utilization for Gemini 1.5 Pro |  |  |


**C. AI Provider Integration:**

| Criterion ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Testing Method | Acceptance Level | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI-1 | Azure OpenAI Integration |  The system successfully integrates with the Azure OpenAI service using Entra ID authentication (or API key). | Integration Tests |  Successful document generation using Azure OpenAI |  |  |
| AI-2 | Google AI Integration | The system successfully integrates with the Google AI service using the provided API key. | Integration Tests | Successful document generation using Google AI |  |  |
| AI-3 | GitHub AI Integration | The system successfully integrates with the GitHub AI service using the provided API token. | Integration Tests | Successful document generation using GitHub AI |  |  |
| AI-4 | Ollama Integration | The system successfully integrates with the local Ollama instance. | Integration Tests | Successful document generation using Ollama |  |  |
| AI-5 | Provider Failover | The system gracefully handles failures of one AI provider by automatically switching to a backup provider. | Integration Tests, Simulated Provider Failures |  Successful failover to backup provider within a defined timeframe |  |  |


**D. CLI & Output:**

| Criterion ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Testing Method | Acceptance Level | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CLI-1 | Command-Line Interface |  The CLI provides clear and intuitive commands for generating documents, managing configurations, and accessing system information.  | Manual Testing, User Documentation Review |  All commands function as expected, clear and concise user documentation |  |  |
| CLI-2 | Output Formatting |  Generated documents are correctly formatted (Markdown, JSON, YAML as specified) and adhere to defined style guidelines. | Manual Review, Automated Formatting Checks |  Correct formatting, adherence to style guidelines |  |  |
| CLI-3 | Organized Output | Generated documents are organized into a clear and logical directory structure. | Manual Review |  Clear and logical directory structure |  |  |


**II. Non-Functional Requirements:**

| Criterion ID | Description | Acceptance Criteria | Testing Method | Acceptance Level | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | Performance |  Document generation time is within acceptable limits (defined based on document size and complexity). | Performance Testing |  Document generation time meets defined thresholds |  |  |
| NFR-2 | Scalability | The system can handle a large number of input documents and generate a large number of output documents without performance degradation. | Load Testing |  System performance remains acceptable under high load |  |  |
| NFR-3 | Security | The system securely handles sensitive data (API keys, project information) and protects against unauthorized access. | Security Audit, Penetration Testing |  No critical security vulnerabilities identified |  |  |
| NFR-4 | Reliability | The system is robust and reliable, with effective error handling and recovery mechanisms. | Integration Tests, Simulated Failures |  System uptime and error rate meet defined thresholds |  |  |

This template provides a framework.  Specific acceptance criteria may need to be refined based on further design and development.  The "Status" column should be updated throughout the testing process.  The "Notes" column can be used to record any relevant observations or issues encountered during testing.
