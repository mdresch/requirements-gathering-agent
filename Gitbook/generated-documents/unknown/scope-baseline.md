# Scope Baseline Document: Requirements Gathering Agent Project

**Document ID:** RGA-SB-001
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Version:** 1.0

**1. Introduction**

This document establishes the Scope Baseline for the Requirements Gathering Agent (RGA) project.  The Scope Baseline defines the features, functionality, and deliverables that constitute the completed project.  It serves as a crucial reference point for managing project scope, tracking progress, and controlling changes throughout the project lifecycle.  This baseline is based on the approved Project Scope Statement (Document ID: RGA-PSS-001), the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (Document ID: RGA-WBS-001), and the WBS Dictionary (Document ID: RGA-WBS-DIC-001).  All three documents are appended to this document for complete reference.

**2. Approved Project Scope Statement Summary (RGA-PSS-001)**

The RGA project aims to develop an AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. The tool will leverage Azure OpenAI (primarily) and other AI providers (Google AI Studio, GitHub AI, Ollama) to analyze project context from various sources (README.md, requirements documents, architecture diagrams, etc.), and automatically generate a suite of PMBOK documents.  Key features include:

*   Comprehensive PMBOK document suite generation (29 documents)
*   Enhanced project analysis capabilities, scoring source relevance (0-100)
*   Intelligent context building and management for large language models (up to 90% utilization)
*   PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation and quality assessment
*   Cross-document consistency checks
*   Modular architecture for future extensibility
*   Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
*   Support for multiple AI providers


**3. Approved Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) (RGA-WBS-001)**

The approved WBS, presented in hierarchical format in Appendix A, decomposes the project into manageable work packages.  Each work package is further detailed in the WBS Dictionary.

**4. Approved WBS Dictionary (RGA-WBS-DIC-001)**

The WBS Dictionary, detailed in Appendix B, provides a comprehensive description of each work package identified in the WBS, including:

*   Deliverable Description
*   Acceptance Criteria
*   Responsible Party
*   Key Dependencies
*   Estimated Duration and Effort


**5. Scope Baseline Use for Performance Measurement**

The Scope Baseline will be used as the primary reference for measuring project performance.  Any deviations from the approved scope, as defined in the Project Scope Statement, WBS, and WBS Dictionary, will be formally managed through a Change Control Process (Document ID: RGA-CCP-001).  Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques will be employed to track progress against the planned scope and budget.  Regular reporting will compare actual work performed against the planned work packages defined in the Scope Baseline.

**6. Scope Baseline Maintenance and Updates**

The Scope Baseline is a controlled document. Any proposed changes to the scope will be documented in a formal Change Request (Document ID: RGA-CR-XXX), assessed for impact, and approved or rejected through the Change Control Process.  Approved changes will result in a revised Scope Baseline, issued with a new version number.  The Change Control Board (CCB) will be responsible for approving or rejecting change requests.  A record of all changes, including the rationale, impact assessment, and approval, will be maintained.

**7. Relationship to Other Project Baselines**

The Scope Baseline is closely related to other project baselines, including the Schedule Baseline (Document ID: RGA-SB-SCH-001) and the Cost Baseline (Document ID: RGA-SB-COST-001).  Changes to the Scope Baseline will likely necessitate updates to the Schedule and Cost Baselines to reflect the impact of the change.  The integration and impact of scope changes on other baselines will be carefully analyzed during the Change Control Process.
