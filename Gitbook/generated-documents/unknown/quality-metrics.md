## Comprehensive Quality Metrics Definitions for the ADPA Project

This document defines quality metrics for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, categorized for clarity and aligned with the project's goals and features.  Metrics are designed to be measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).

**I. Functional Quality Metrics:**  These metrics assess the correctness and completeness of ADPA's core functionality.

* **1.1 PMBOK Document Generation Accuracy:**
    * **Definition:** Percentage of generated PMBOK documents that are complete and conform to PMBOK 7.0 standards.  This includes checking for all required sections, accurate terminology, and consistent formatting.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated validation against a PMBOK 7.0 compliance checklist and manual review of a statistically significant sample of generated documents.
    * **Target:** 98% accuracy within 3 months of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  If accuracy falls below 95%, trigger a code review and process improvement investigation.


* **1.2 Document Completeness:**
    * **Definition:** Percentage of required sections present in each generated PMBOK document type.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated script checking for the presence of mandatory sections defined in the PMBOK 7.0 standard for each document type.
    * **Target:** 100% completeness for all mandatory sections within 2 months of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  Any incompleteness triggers immediate investigation and correction.


* **1.3 AI Provider Fallback Success Rate:**
    * **Definition:** Percentage of successful document generations when the primary AI provider fails. This measures the robustness of the fallback mechanism.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated logging and analysis of successful fallback attempts during testing and production use.
    * **Target:** 99% success rate within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:** A rate below 95% requires immediate investigation of fallback mechanisms.


* **1.4 Context Utilization Rate:**
    * **Definition:** Average percentage of available tokens utilized by the Enhanced Context Manager for each document generation. This measures the efficiency of context management.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated logging and analysis of token usage during document generation.
    * **Target:**  Average of 80% utilization for large language models within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  Average utilization below 60% requires investigation into context management strategies.


* **1.5 CLI Command Success Rate:**
    * **Definition:** Percentage of successfully executed CLI commands without errors.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated testing of all CLI commands and manual testing of edge cases.  Logging of errors during production use.
    * **Target:** 100% success rate for core commands within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:** Any failure triggers immediate debugging and correction.


* **1.6 VCS Integration Success Rate:**
    * **Definition:** Percentage of successful version control operations (commit, revert, etc.) without errors.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated testing of VCS commands and manual testing of edge cases. Logging of errors during production use.
    * **Target:** 99.9% success rate within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:** Any failure rate above 0.1% requires investigation of VCS integration.


**II. Non-Functional Quality Metrics:** These metrics assess aspects beyond the core functionality, focusing on usability, performance, and security.


* **2.1  Document Readability Score:**
    * **Definition:** Average readability score (e.g., using Flesch-Kincaid) of generated documents.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated readability analysis of a sample of generated documents.
    * **Target:**  Average score of 70 (easily understandable) within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  Scores below 60 indicate a need for improvements in document generation.


* **2.2 Generation Time:**
    * **Definition:** Average time taken to generate a complete set of PMBOK documents.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated timing of the generation process during testing.
    * **Target:**  Average generation time under 5 minutes for a medium-sized project within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:** Generation times exceeding 10 minutes require performance optimization.


* **2.3  Error Handling Robustness:**
    * **Definition:** Number of critical errors encountered per 1000 document generation attempts.
    * **Measurement Method:** Automated logging and analysis of errors during testing and production use.
    * **Target:** Less than 1 critical error per 1000 attempts within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  More than 5 critical errors per 1000 attempts requires immediate investigation and error handling improvements.


* **2.4 API Response Time:**
    * **Definition:** Average response time from the AI provider APIs.
    * **Measurement Method:**  Automated monitoring and logging of API response times.
    * **Target:**  Average response time under 2 seconds within 1 month of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  Average response times exceeding 5 seconds require investigation of API performance or provider selection.


* **2.5 Security Vulnerability Rate:**
    * **Definition:** Number of security vulnerabilities identified per 1000 lines of code.
    * **Measurement Method:** Regular security audits and penetration testing.
    * **Target:**  Zero critical security vulnerabilities within 3 months of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:** Any identified vulnerabilities trigger immediate remediation.


**III. User Satisfaction Metrics:** These metrics focus on user experience and overall satisfaction.


* **3.1 User Satisfaction Score (NPS):**
    * **Definition:** Net Promoter Score based on user surveys.
    * **Measurement Method:** Regular user surveys using a standardized NPS questionnaire.
    * **Target:**  NPS score of 70 or higher within 6 months of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  NPS below 50 requires immediate investigation and improvement actions.


* **3.2  Number of User Support Requests:**
    * **Definition:** Number of user support requests received per 1000 users.
    * **Measurement Method:** Tracking user support requests through the support system.
    * **Target:** Less than 5 support requests per 1000 users per month within 6 months of the release of version 2.1.3.
    * **Threshold:**  More than 10 support requests per 1000 users per month triggers investigation of usability issues.


**IV. Business Metrics:** These metrics assess the success of the project from a business perspective.


* **4.1 Weekly Downloads:**
    * **Definition:** Number of weekly downloads from npm.  (Already tracked, but included for completeness)
    * **Measurement Method:**  Tracking via npm package statistics.
    * **Target:**  Maintain and increase weekly downloads consistently.
    * **Threshold:** A significant drop in downloads triggers investigation of marketing and product improvements.


* **4.2 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
    * **Definition:** Cost of acquiring a new paying customer.
    * **Measurement Method:** Tracking marketing and sales expenses against new paying customers.
