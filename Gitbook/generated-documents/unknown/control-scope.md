## Control Scope Process for Requirements Gathering Agent Project (PMBOK 7th Edition)

This Control Scope process outlines the procedures for monitoring and managing changes to the project scope throughout the Requirements Gathering Agent project lifecycle.  It aligns with PMBOK 7th Edition guidelines.

**1.  Monitor Scope:**

* **Inputs:**
    * Project Management Plan (specifically the Scope Management Plan) –  This plan defines the scope baseline,  the process for managing scope changes, and the tools and techniques for monitoring scope.  Referencing the provided `01_SCOPE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.MD` document is crucial.
    * Work Performance Data – This includes actual work completed, schedule performance, cost performance, and any identified issues or risks affecting scope.  The project's progress tracking system will be the source.
    * Project Documents – This includes the Project Charter, Requirements Traceability Matrix, WBS, WBS Dictionary (`05_WBS_DICTIONARY.MD`), and any other relevant documentation.
    * Enterprise Environmental Factors – External factors influencing scope, such as regulatory changes or stakeholder demands.
    * Organizational Process Assets – Templates, guidelines, and lessons learned from past projects.

* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Expert Judgment –  Leveraging the experience of the project manager and team to identify potential scope creep.
    * Data Analysis – Analyzing work performance data to identify variances from the scope baseline.
    * Inspection – Regularly reviewing the project deliverables against the scope baseline.
    * Meetings – Holding regular status meetings with stakeholders to discuss scope-related issues.
    * Issue Log – Tracking and managing scope-related issues.  The `Issue Log` will be a key document, updated regularly.
    * Change Control System – The established process for managing and approving any changes to the scope baseline.

* **Outputs:**
    * Work Performance Information – Updated information reflecting the project's progress against the scope baseline.
    * Change Requests – Formal requests for changes to the scope baseline.  These will be processed through the formal Change Control System.
    * Issue Log – Updated log reflecting any scope-related issues.
    * Project Management Plan Updates – Modifications to the Scope Management Plan based on lessons learned and performance data.


**2. Perform Integrated Change Control:**

* **Inputs:**
    * Change Requests – Generated from the Monitor Scope process.
    * Project Management Plan – The baseline scope, change management process, and other relevant information.
    * Project Documents – WBS, WBS Dictionary, Requirements Traceability Matrix, and other relevant documentation.
    * Enterprise Environmental Factors – External factors affecting the change request evaluation.
    * Organizational Process Assets – Templates and guidelines for change request evaluation.

* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Expert Judgment – Assessing the impact of the change requests.
    * Decision-Making – Evaluating and approving or rejecting change requests.
    * Meetings – Holding meetings with stakeholders to discuss change requests.
    * Change Control System – Formal process for managing changes (including approval, implementation, and verification).
    * Cost-Benefit Analysis – Evaluating the cost and benefit of each change request.
    * Data Analysis – Analyzing the impact of change requests on the schedule and budget.

* **Outputs:**
    * Approved Change Requests – Change requests that have been approved and will be implemented.
    * Rejected Change Requests – Change requests that have been rejected.
    * Project Documents Updates – Updated project documents to reflect approved changes (WBS, WBS Dictionary, scope statement, etc.).
    * Project Management Plan Updates – Updates to the project management plan to reflect approved changes.
    * Work Performance Information – Updated information reflecting the implementation of approved changes.


**3. Validate Scope:**

* **Inputs:**
    * Project Management Plan – The scope baseline and the process for validating scope.
    * Deliverables – The completed project deliverables.
    * Approved Change Requests – Approved changes to the scope baseline.
    * Requirements Documentation – Formal requirements for the project.
    * Work Performance Information – The project's progress against the scope baseline.

* **Tools & Techniques:**
    * Inspection – Examining the completed deliverables to ensure they meet the requirements.
    * Inspection/Verification – Formal inspection against the requirements, using checklists, and confirming that the project has met the scope baseline.
    * Data Analysis – Analyzing the work performance data to verify that the project has met the scope baseline.
    * Meetings – Holding meetings with stakeholders to review and approve the completed deliverables.

* **Outputs:**
    * Accepted Deliverables – Deliverables that have been formally approved by stakeholders.
    * Verified Deliverables – Deliverables that have been verified to meet the requirements.
    * Project Management Plan Updates – Updates to the project management plan based on the validation process.
    * Change Requests – Any issues identified during validation will lead to new change requests.


**Specific Considerations for the Requirements Gathering Agent Project:**

* **AI-driven changes:** The use of AI in the project introduces potential for unexpected outcomes.  The scope management plan should account for adjustments needed due to AI performance variations or unexpected outputs.
* **JSON schema validation:**  The project's focus on strict JSON outputs requires rigorous validation during the Validate Scope process to ensure data integrity and PMBOK compliance.
* **Stakeholder management:**  Regular communication and collaboration with stakeholders are crucial for managing scope changes and ensuring everyone is aligned on the project's goals.


This detailed Control Scope process, tailored to the Requirements Gathering Agent project, ensures that the project remains on track, meeting its objectives within the defined scope, and adhering to PMBOK 7th Edition best practices.  The integration of the provided documentation fragments ensures a strong foundation for the process.
