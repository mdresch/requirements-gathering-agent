## Project Management Plan: Requirements Gathering Agent

This plan adheres to the PMBOK 7th Edition standards and is based on the provided project context.  Due to the length and complexity of a full PMBOK plan, this response will provide a structured outline with key elements and examples, rather than a complete, verbatim document.  A real-world project would require significantly more detail in each section.

**1. Project Charter:**

* **Project Goal:** Develop and deploy an AI-powered tool generating PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* **Project Objectives:**  Automate documentation creation, improve accuracy and consistency, reduce time spent on documentation, ensure PMBOK compliance.
* **High-Level Requirements:**  Detailed in the README (e.g., Azure OpenAI integration, CLI interface, PMBOK 7.0 compliance).
* **Stakeholders:** Identified in the README (Project Managers, Developers, Business Analysts).
* **Project Manager:** [Assign Name and Contact]
* **Project Sponsor:** [Assign Name and Contact]
* **Budget:** [Insert Budget]
* **Timeline:** [Insert Timeline â€“  e.g., using Gantt chart]


**2. Project Management Plan:**

This section details how the project will be managed.  It includes (but is not limited to) the following plans:

* **2.1 Scope Management Plan:** Defines the project boundaries, deliverables, and acceptance criteria.  This leverages the information already present in the README's features and generated documents section.  Key elements include:
    * **Scope Statement:** A formal document defining the project's boundaries.
    * **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):**  A hierarchical decomposition of the project work, already partially outlined in the README.
    * **WBS Dictionary:**  A detailed description of each WBS element (see example in provided text).
    * **Scope Baseline:**  The approved scope statement and WBS.
    * **Change Control Process:** A formal process for managing changes to the project scope.

* **2.2 Schedule Management Plan:** Defines how the project schedule will be planned, executed, monitored, and controlled.
    * **Network Diagram:** A visual representation of the project schedule (e.g., using MS Project or similar).
    * **Critical Path:** Identification of the longest path in the network diagram.
    * **Schedule Baseline:** The approved project schedule.
    * **Schedule Control Process:**  A process for managing changes to the project schedule.

* **2.3 Cost Management Plan:** Defines how the project costs will be planned, estimated, budgeted, monitored, and controlled.
    * **Cost Baseline:** The approved project budget.
    * **Cost Control Process:** A process for managing changes to the project budget.  This needs to account for Azure OpenAI API usage costs.

* **2.4 Quality Management Plan:** Defines how the project quality will be planned, managed, and controlled.
    * **Quality Metrics:**  Defines how quality will be measured (e.g., PMBOK compliance, code quality, user satisfaction).
    * **Quality Control Process:**  A process for ensuring that the project deliverables meet the quality requirements.  This includes the validation features detailed in the README.

* **2.5 Resource Management Plan:** Defines how the project resources (people, equipment, materials) will be planned, acquired, managed, and controlled.
    * **Resource Calendar:** Shows resource availability.
    * **Resource Assignment:**  Assigns resources to tasks.

* **2.6 Communications Management Plan:** Defines how information will be collected, created, distributed, stored, retrieved, managed, controlled, monitored, and disposed of.
    * **Communication Matrix:** Defines communication channels and frequency.
    * **Stakeholder Communication Plan:**  A plan for communicating with each stakeholder group.

* **2.7 Risk Management Plan:** Identifies potential risks and defines strategies for mitigating them.  The README already highlights some potential risks (API limitations, context handling).
    * **Risk Register:** A list of identified risks, their probability, impact, and mitigation strategies.

* **2.8 Procurement Management Plan:**  If applicable, outlines how external resources or services will be acquired (potentially not needed for this project).

* **2.9 Stakeholder Management Plan:**  Defines how stakeholders will be identified, analyzed, engaged, and managed.  This is already partially addressed in the README's description of user personas.


**3. Requirements Management Plan:**

This section details how the project requirements will be managed.  It's heavily informed by the README:

* **Requirements Traceability Matrix:**  Links requirements to deliverables and test cases.
* **Requirements Gathering Techniques:**  Methods used to gather requirements (analysis of README, user stories, etc.).
* **Requirements Prioritization:**  A method for prioritizing requirements (e.g., MoSCoW method).
* **Requirements Change Management:**  A process for managing changes to the requirements.


**4.  Project Execution and Monitoring:**

This section details how the project will be executed and monitored.  It includes:

* **Project Schedule:**  A detailed schedule of project activities.
* **Progress Reports:**  Regular reports showing project progress.
* **Issue Log:**  A log of any issues encountered during the project.
* **Change Requests:**  A log of any changes requested during the project.


**5. Project Closure:**

This section details how the project will be closed.  It includes:

* **Project Sign-off:**  Formal acceptance of the project deliverables.
* **Lessons Learned:**  A document summarizing the lessons learned during the project.
* **Project Documentation Archiving:**  A plan for archiving the project documentation.


This is a high-level outline.  Each section would need substantial expansion with detailed information and artifacts relevant to the project.  The README provides a strong foundation for many of these sections.  Remember to utilize appropriate tools and templates to manage the project effectively.
