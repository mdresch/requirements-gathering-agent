**Built with ❤️ by [Menno Drescher] (https://exceptional-cba-project.webflow.io/) using Azure OpenAI**

## 🟡 Outstanding/Recent Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Zero Tokens in Context for Some Documents
- **Symptom:** Some generated documents (e.g., user-personas) showed `Final context: 0 tokens`.
- **Root Cause:** The Enhanced Context Manager was not being populated with the discovered markdown files from project analysis, resulting in an empty context for those documents.
- **Fix:** Added logic to ensure all discovered markdown files are added to the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context before document generation. Now, each document receives the full relevant context, and token counts reflect actual content.

### Issue: CLI Permission Denied (`npx rga`)
- **Symptom:** Running `npx rga` resulted in `Permission denied`.
- **Root Cause:** The CLI binary was not executable or not properly linked after build.
- **Fix:** Ensured the CLI is built (`npm run build`), has executable permissions (`chmod +x dist/cli.js`), and is correctly linked in the npm bin directory. Also, documented alternative run commands (`npm start`, `node dist/cli.js`).

### Issue: Enhanced Context Not Utilized for Large Models
- **Symptom:** Large language models (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro) were not utilizing their full context window.
- **Root Cause:** The context manager was not auto-detecting model capabilities or was too conservative in context allocation.
- **Fix:** Improved model detection and context allocation logic. Now, up to 90% of available tokens are used for ultra-large models, maximizing documentation accuracy.

---

## 🔧 Suggestions for Further Improvement

The Requirements Gathering Agent is robust and production-ready, but here are some areas for future enhancement—especially in the project analysis and context-building system:

- **Direct Context Injection:**  
  Add a function to directly inject all high-relevance markdown files into the Enhanced Context Manager’s enriched context, not just the combined context string. This will further improve per-document context building and accuracy for large LLMs.

- **Async Parallelization:**  
  For very large projects, consider parallelizing directory scans to speed up project analysis and markdown discovery.

- **Configurable Limits:**  
  Allow configuration of the maximum number of files and maximum content length included in the context via CLI options or environment variables, giving users more control over context size and performance.

- **Custom Directory Patterns:**  
  Enable users to specify additional directories or filename patterns to include or exclude in the analysis, making the tool even more flexible for diverse project structures.

- **Context Utilization Feedback:**  
  Provide real-time feedback or warnings if the context is being truncated due to token limits, and suggest ways to optimize context inclusion.


## 🧠 Enhanced llmProcessor.ts Improvements

```bash
npm install requirements-gathering-agent
```

## Quick Start

### Basic Strategic Planning

```typescript
import { generateRequirements, generateStrategicSections } from 'requirements-gathering-agent';

const result = await generateStrategicSections({
  businessProblem: 'Describe your business problem here',
  technologyStack: ['TypeScript', 'Next.js'],
  contextBundle: 'Additional context here'
});

console.log(result.vision, result.mission, result.coreValues, result.purpose);
```

### Generate PMBOK Documentation

```typescript
import { 
  getAiProjectCharter,
  getAiScopeManagementPlan,
  getAiScheduleManagementPlan,
  getAiRiskManagementPlan
} from 'requirements-gathering-agent';

// Generate a complete project charter
const charter = await getAiProjectCharter({
  businessProblem: 'Need a customer relationship management system',
  technologyStack: ['React', 'Node.js', 'PostgreSQL'],
  contextBundle: 'Enterprise CRM for sales team automation'
});

// Generate comprehensive management plans
const scopePlan = await getAiScopeManagementPlan({
  businessProblem: 'Need a customer relationship management system',
  technologyStack: ['React', 'Node.js', 'PostgreSQL'],
  contextBundle: 'Enterprise CRM for sales team automation'
});
```

### Command Line Interface

Generate documents directly from the command line:

```bash
# First, set up your Azure AI credentials (required for AI generation)
# Create a .env.local file or set environment variables:
# AZURE_AI_API_KEY=your_azure_ai_api_key
# AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_ai_endpoint

# Build the TypeScript project
npm run build

# Generate all PMBOK documents
npm run generate-docs
# OR
npm start
# OR
node dist/cli.js

# For development with auto-compilation
npm run dev
```

# Using a High-Token LLM Model

To use a large-context LLM (such as GPT-4-32k, Claude 3, etc.) for requirements and PMBOK document generation, set the environment variable `REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_MODEL` to your desired model name before running the agent. This enables processing and generating longer documents without token limit issues.

**Example (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
export REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_MODEL="openai/gpt-4-32k"
# Then run your application as usual
```

If you use a `.env` file, add:
```
REQUIREMENTS_AGENT_MODEL=openai/gpt-4-32k
```

The agent will automatically use the specified model for all LLM-powered operations.

# Integration Guide

This agent can be integrated into any Node.js/TypeScript project to automate comprehensive project management documentation generation.

## Setup in New Project

### 1. Copy the Module
Copy the entire `requirements-gathering-agent` directory into your project:
```bash
# Copy to project root
cp -r requirements-gathering-agent /path/to/your/project/

# Or copy to libs directory
cp -r requirements-gathering-agent /path/to/your/project/libs/
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @azure-rest/ai-inference @azure/core-auth
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Set up your Azure AI Inference API credentials:
```bash
# .env file
AZURE_AI_API_KEY=your_azure_ai_api_key
AZURE_AI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_ai_endpoint
```

### 4. Import and Use
```typescript
import { 
  generateStrategicSections, 
  generateRequirements,
  getAiProjectCharter,
  getAiScopeManagementPlan 
} from './requirements-gathering-agent/index.js';

// Generate strategic documentation
const strategic = await generateStrategicSections({
  businessProblem: 'A SaaS platform for remote team collaboration',
  technologyStack: ['Node.js', 'React', 'PostgreSQL'],
  contextBundle: 'Real-time collaboration platform for distributed teams'
});

// Generate PMBOK documentation
const charter = await getAiProjectCharter({
  businessProblem: 'A SaaS platform for remote team collaboration',
  technologyStack: ['Node.js', 'React', 'PostgreSQL'],
  contextBundle: 'Real-time collaboration platform for distributed teams'
});
```

### 5. Document Generation Script
Create a script to generate all project documentation:

```typescript
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
import { 
  getAiSummaryAndGoals,
  getAiUserStories,
  getAiProjectCharter,
  getAiScopeManagementPlan,
  getAiScheduleManagementPlan,
  getAiRiskManagementPlan,
  getAiWbs,
  getAiStakeholderRegister
} from './requirements-gathering-agent/index.js';

async function generateProjectDocumentation() {
  const projectContext = `
# Your Project Name
A comprehensive description of your project

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Technology Stack
- Node.js backend
- React frontend
- PostgreSQL database
`;

  // Create docs directory
  await mkdir('./docs', { recursive: true });

  // Generate AI-powered documents
  const summary = await getAiSummaryAndGoals(projectContext);
  const userStories = await getAiUserStories(projectContext);
  
  // Generate PMBOK documents with proper context objects
  const charter = await getAiProjectCharter({
    summaryAndGoals: summary,
    strategicStatements: 'Generated strategic statements',
    coreValuesAndPurpose: 'Generated core values',
    keyRolesAndNeeds: 'Generated roles and needs',
    riskAnalysis: 'Generated risk analysis', 
    personas: 'Generated personas',
    techStackAnalysis: 'Generated tech analysis'
  });
  
  const scopePlan = await getAiScopeManagementPlan({
    projectCharterOutput: charter,
    stakeholderRegisterOutput: 'Generated stakeholder register',
    aiSummaryAndGoalsOutput: summary
  });

  // Write all documents
  await Promise.all([
    writeFile('./docs/project-summary.md', summary),
    writeFile('./docs/user-stories.md', userStories),
    writeFile('./docs/project-charter.md', charter),
    writeFile('./docs/scope-management-plan.md', scopePlan)
  ]);

  console.log('✅ Project documentation generated successfully!');
}

generateProjectDocumentation().catch(console.error);
```

> **Note**: When copying the agent to your project, import from the relative path. When using as an npm package, import from the package name.

## Example: Complete Project Setup

```typescript
// generate-docs.ts
import { writeFile, mkdir } from 'fs/promises';
import { 
  generateStrategicSections,
  getAiProjectCharter,
  getAiScopeManagementPlan,
  getAiRiskManagementPlan,
  getAiWbs,
  getAiActivityList,
  getAiMilestoneList,
  getAiStakeholderRegister,
  getAiTechStackAnalysis
} from './requirements-gathering-agent/index.js';

(async () => {
  const projectDetails = {
    businessProblem: 'Need an e-commerce platform for small businesses',
    technologyStack: ['React', 'Node.js', 'MongoDB', 'Stripe'],
    contextBundle: 'Multi-tenant e-commerce solution with inventory management, payment processing, and analytics dashboard'
  };

  // Create documentation structure
  await mkdir('./project-docs', { recursive: true });
  await mkdir('./project-docs/pmbok', { recursive: true });

  console.log('🚀 Generating comprehensive project documentation...');

  // Generate all documents
  const [
    strategic,
    charter,
    scopePlan,
    riskPlan,
    wbs,
    activities,
    milestones,
    stakeholders,
    techAnalysis
  ] = await Promise.all([
    generateStrategicSections(projectDetails),
    getAiProjectCharter(projectDetails),
    getAiScopeManagementPlan(projectDetails),
    getAiRiskManagementPlan(projectDetails),
    getAiWbs(projectDetails),
    getAiActivityList(projectDetails),
    getAiMilestoneList(projectDetails),
    getAiStakeholderRegister(projectDetails),
    getAiTechStackAnalysis(projectDetails)
  ]);

  // Write organized documentation
  await Promise.all([
    writeFile('./project-docs/strategic-overview.json', JSON.stringify(strategic, null, 2)),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/01-project-charter.md', charter),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/02-scope-management-plan.md', scopePlan),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/03-risk-management-plan.md', riskPlan),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/04-work-breakdown-structure.md', wbs),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/05-activity-list.md', activities),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/06-milestone-list.md', milestones),
    writeFile('./project-docs/pmbok/07-stakeholder-register.md', stakeholders),
    writeFile('./project-docs/technical-analysis.md', techAnalysis)
  ]);

  console.log('✅ Complete project documentation generated in ./project-docs/');
})();
```

## Publishing as Package

For multi-project use, publish to npm:

1. **Update package.json**:
```json
{
  "name": "your-requirements-agent",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
}
```

2. **Build and publish**:
```bash
npm run build
npm publish
```

3. **Install in other projects**:
```bash
npm install your-requirements-agent
```

## Technical Requirements

- **Node.js**: 18+ (for ES modules support)
- **TypeScript**: 4.5+ (for proper type definitions)
- **Azure AI Inference API**: Valid API key and endpoint
- **Dependencies**: `@azure-rest/ai-inference`, `@azure/core-auth`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File Permission Errors**: Ensure write permissions for output directories
2. **API Key Issues**: Verify Azure AI credentials are properly configured
3. **Module Import Errors**: Check that you're using ES modules (`.js` extensions in imports)
4. **TypeScript Compilation**: Ensure `tsconfig.json` is configured for ES modules
