# Monitor and Control Project Work

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023 (Updated as needed)


**1. Purpose**

This document outlines the process for monitoring and controlling the work performed on the ADPA project.  It details the methods used to track progress, manage changes, identify and mitigate risks, and ensure the project stays on track to meet its objectives and deliverable timelines as defined in the Project Management Plan.  Given the unique nature of ADPA – its self-authorizing inception and AI-driven capabilities –  monitoring will incorporate both traditional PMBOK approaches and AI-specific performance metrics.


**2. Scope**

This plan covers the monitoring and controlling of all aspects of the ADPA project, including but not limited to:

* **Scope Management:** Tracking adherence to the project scope statement, managing change requests, and ensuring scope creep is minimized.
* **Schedule Management:** Monitoring progress against the project schedule, identifying schedule variances, and implementing corrective actions.
* **Cost Management:** Tracking project costs, managing budget variances, and ensuring cost-effectiveness.
* **Quality Management:** Monitoring the quality of deliverables, implementing quality control measures, and addressing quality issues.
* **Resource Management:** Monitoring resource allocation and utilization, managing resource conflicts, and ensuring resources are available when needed.
* **Communications Management:** Monitoring communication channels, ensuring effective communication among stakeholders, and managing communication issues.
* **Risk Management:** Monitoring identified risks, assessing their likelihood and impact, and implementing mitigation strategies.
* **AI Performance Monitoring:** Tracking the performance of the AI models used in ADPA, including accuracy, efficiency, and context utilization.  This includes analyzing the Enhanced Context Manager's performance metrics (token utilization, context strategy effectiveness).  Regular review of the `--context-report`, `--analyze-context`, and `--context-metrics` outputs will be crucial.
* **Version Control Monitoring:** Utilizing the built-in VCS to track changes in generated documents, review commit history, and ensure traceability of all updates.


**3. Monitoring Activities**

The following monitoring activities will be performed regularly:

* **Weekly Status Meetings:**  Project team will meet weekly to review progress, identify issues, and plan for the upcoming week.  The meeting will focus on both traditional project metrics (schedule, budget, risks) and AI performance indicators.  Minutes will be documented and distributed.
* **Progress Reporting:** Regular progress reports will be generated, including burn-down charts, earned value analysis, and AI performance summaries.  These will be shared with stakeholders as defined in the Communication Management Plan.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Risks will be reassessed at least monthly, or more frequently if significant changes occur. The Risk Register will be updated accordingly.
* **Change Management:**  A formal change control process will be followed for all change requests.  Impact assessments will be conducted to determine the effect of changes on the project schedule, budget, and scope.
* **Quality Control:**  Each generated document will undergo automated PMBOK validation and quality assessment.  Manual reviews will be performed for critical deliverables.
* **AI Model Evaluation:**  The performance of the AI models will be continuously monitored and evaluated using both quantitative (e.g., token utilization, response time) and qualitative (e.g., document quality, coherence) metrics.  A/B testing with different models may be employed to optimize performance.
* **Version Control Review:** Regular reviews of the generated documents' version control history using the CLI (`requirements-gathering-agent vcs log`, `requirements-gathering-agent vcs diff`) will be conducted to ensure traceability and auditability.


**4. Control Activities**

The following control activities will be implemented to address any deviations from the project plan:

* **Corrective Actions:**  Corrective actions will be developed and implemented to address any schedule or budget variances.
* **Preventive Actions:**  Preventive actions will be implemented to prevent future problems.
* **Change Requests:**  Formal change requests will be processed to address scope changes.
* **Issue Resolution:**  A formal process will be used to identify, track, and resolve issues.
* **AI Model Retraining/Optimization:**  If AI model performance degrades, retraining or model optimization will be undertaken. This may involve adjusting the Enhanced Context Manager's strategy or exploring alternative AI providers.
* **VCS Conflict Resolution:**  Standard Git branching and merging strategies will be used to handle any version control conflicts.


**5. Reporting**

Monitoring and control information will be reported through:

* **Weekly Status Reports:**  Summarizing progress, issues, and risks.
* **Monthly Progress Reports:**  Providing a more detailed overview of progress and performance.
* **Change Control Logs:**  Documenting all changes made to the project scope, schedule, or budget.
* **Risk Register Updates:**  Tracking changes in identified risks and mitigation strategies.
* **AI Performance Reports:**  Regular analysis of AI model performance metrics.
* **VCS Reports:**  Summarizing changes made to generated documents.


**6. Tools and Techniques**

The following tools and techniques will be used to monitor and control the project:

* **Project Management Software:**  [Specify the software used, e.g., Jira, Asana]
* **Spreadsheet Software:**  [Specify the software used, e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets]
* **Requirements Gathering Agent (ADPA):**  For automated document generation, validation, and quality assessment.
* **Git:**  For version control of generated documents.


**7. Responsibilities**

[Define roles and responsibilities for monitoring and controlling the project.  This should include who is responsible for each monitoring and control activity, and who will receive reports.]


**8.  Metrics**

Key performance indicators (KPIs) will include:

* **Schedule Variance:**  Difference between planned and actual completion dates.
* **Budget Variance:**  Difference between planned and actual costs.
* **Scope Creep:**  Uncontrolled changes to the project scope.
* **Risk Probability and Impact:**  Assessment of the likelihood and impact of identified risks.
* **AI Model Accuracy:**  Percentage of correct predictions or outputs from the AI models.
* **AI Model Efficiency:**  Processing time and resource utilization of AI models.
* **Context Utilization:** Percentage of available tokens used by the Enhanced Context Manager.
* **Document Quality Scores:**  Scores generated by the automated quality assessment system.
* **VCS Commit Frequency:**  Number of commits per week/month, indicating project activity.



This plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect changes in the project.  The project manager is responsible for ensuring that this plan is followed and that the project is monitored and controlled effectively.
