# Monitor and Control Project Work

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

**1. Purpose**

This document outlines the process for monitoring and controlling the work performed on the ADPA project.  It details the methods used to track progress, manage changes, identify and mitigate risks, and ensure the project stays on track to meet its objectives and deliverable timelines as defined in the Project Management Plan.  This plan is specifically tailored to the unique aspects of the ADPA project, including its AI-driven nature and the generation of PMBOK-compliant documentation.


**2. Scope**

This plan covers the monitoring and controlling of all project work, including:

* **Technical Development:**  Tracking progress on the development of the core ADPA application, including the 10 specialized technical document processors, CLI integration, and modular architecture. This includes monitoring code quality, testing progress, and addressing bugs.
* **AI Integration:** Monitoring the performance and reliability of the integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama, including API call success rates, latency, and cost optimization.
* **Documentation Generation:**  Monitoring the quality and accuracy of the generated PMBOK documents, including the new technical design document suite, strategic statements, and any other project documentation. This includes validating PMBOK 7.0 compliance and conducting quality assessments.
* **Testing and Validation:** Monitoring the progress of testing activities, including unit tests, integration tests, and PMBOK compliance validation.  This also includes analyzing test results and identifying areas for improvement.
* **Stakeholder Management:** Tracking stakeholder engagement activities, including communication, feedback gathering, and issue resolution.
* **Risk Management:**  Continuously monitoring identified risks and implementing mitigation strategies as needed.

**3. Monitoring Process**

The following methods will be used to monitor project work:

* **Regular Progress Meetings:** Weekly meetings with the development team to review progress, identify roadblocks, and adjust plans as needed.
* **Automated Reporting:** The ADPA tool itself will generate reports on context utilization, document generation times, and validation results.  These reports will be reviewed regularly and used to identify potential issues.
* **Automated Testing:**  Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines will be used to automatically run unit and integration tests, providing immediate feedback on code quality and functionality.
* **PMBOK Compliance Validation:**  Automated validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards will provide continuous feedback on the completeness and accuracy of generated documents.
* **Stakeholder Feedback:** Regular feedback will be gathered from stakeholders through surveys, progress reports, and direct communication.
* **Risk Register Review:** The Risk Register will be reviewed regularly, and mitigation strategies will be updated as needed.
* **Version Control System:** The integrated Version Control System will track all changes to the generated documents, providing a complete audit trail and enabling easy rollback to previous versions.

**4. Control Process**

The following methods will be used to control project work:

* **Change Management:** A formal change management process will be followed for all changes to the project scope, requirements, or deliverables.  This process will ensure that all changes are properly documented, reviewed, and approved before implementation.
* **Issue Tracking:**  A system for tracking and resolving issues will be used to ensure that all problems are addressed promptly. This system will leverage GitHub Issues and regular progress meetings.
* **Risk Response Planning:**  Mitigation strategies will be implemented for identified risks, and contingency plans will be developed to address unexpected issues.
* **Quality Assurance:**  Regular quality assurance reviews will be conducted to ensure that the generated documents meet the required quality standards and are compliant with PMBOK 7.0.  The built-in validation framework will be a key component of this process.
* **Resource Allocation:**  Resources will be allocated as needed to address issues, implement changes, and ensure that the project stays on track.  This will involve monitoring resource utilization and making adjustments as necessary.
* **Communication:** Regular communication will be maintained with stakeholders to keep them informed of progress, issues, and changes.

**5. Metrics**

The following metrics will be used to track project performance:

* **Weekly Downloads:**  Tracking the number of weekly downloads on NPM to gauge market adoption.
* **Document Generation Time:**  Monitoring the time required to generate documents to identify areas for performance optimization.
* **Context Utilization:** Tracking the percentage of available tokens used by the AI models to ensure efficient context management.
* **PMBOK Compliance Score:**  Measuring the compliance of generated documents against PMBOK 7.0 standards.
* **Bug Count:**  Tracking the number of bugs identified and resolved to assess code quality.
* **Stakeholder Satisfaction:**  Gathering feedback from stakeholders to measure their satisfaction with the project progress and deliverables.


**6. Reporting**

Regular reports will be generated to track project progress and identify potential issues.  These reports will include:

* **Weekly Status Reports:**  Summarizing project progress, highlighting key achievements, and identifying any roadblocks.
* **Milestone Reports:**  Detailed reports on the achievement of significant milestones.
* **Risk Reports:**  Summarizing identified risks, mitigation strategies, and contingency plans.
* **Quality Assurance Reports:**  Providing detailed feedback on the quality of generated documents and PMBOK compliance.
* **Context Utilization Reports:**  Providing detailed insights into the Enhanced Context Manager's performance.


**7. Tools**

The following tools will be used to monitor and control project work:

* **ADPA (Requirements Gathering Agent):** For automated document generation, PMBOK validation, and reporting.
* **GitHub:** For version control, issue tracking, and collaboration.
* **Project Management Software (e.g., Jira, Asana):** For task management and progress tracking (if applicable).
* **Communication Platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):** For communication and collaboration.


**8. Responsibilities**

* **Project Manager:** Overall responsibility for monitoring and controlling project work.
* **Development Team:** Responsible for developing and testing the ADPA application.
* **Stakeholders:** Responsible for providing feedback and participating in progress reviews.


**9. Change Control**

Any changes to the project scope, requirements, or deliverables will be managed through a formal change control process.  This process will involve:

1. **Change Request:**  A formal change request will be submitted, documenting the proposed change, its impact, and the rationale.
2. **Impact Assessment:**  The impact of the proposed change will be assessed, considering cost, schedule, and risk.
3. **Review and Approval:**  The change request will be reviewed and approved by the appropriate stakeholders.
4. **Implementation:**  The approved change will be implemented, and its impact will be monitored.
5. **Verification:**  The implemented change will be verified to ensure that it meets the requirements.

This Monitor and Control Project Work plan will be reviewed and updated regularly to reflect the evolving needs of the ADPA project.
