# Project Charter: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Manager:**  [Insert Project Manager Name and Contact Information]

**3. Project Sponsor:** [Insert Project Sponsor Name and Contact Information]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Insert Project Start Date]

**5. Project End Date:** [Insert Project End Date -  This should be a realistic estimate based on the project scope]

**6. Project Goal:** To develop and deploy a robust, AI-powered command-line interface (CLI) tool that leverages advanced language models to generate comprehensive, PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation from a project's README and associated files.  This includes generating technical design documents and strategic business communications.  The tool will be distributed via npm.

**7. Project Objectives:**

*   Develop a CLI tool capable of generating at least 29 PMBOK-compliant project documents.
*   Implement a modular architecture to allow for easy expansion of document types and AI provider support (Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama).
*   Achieve a minimum of 90% PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation for all generated documents.
*   Maintain a user-friendly and intuitive CLI interface with comprehensive help documentation.
*   Implement a version control system (VCS) for generated documents, allowing for version tracking and rollback.
*   Achieve 200 weekly downloads on NPM within [Timeframe, e.g., 6 months] of release.
*   Maintain a minimum average user satisfaction rating of [Rating, e.g., 4.5 out of 5 stars] based on user feedback.


**8. Project Scope:**

**In Scope:**

*   Development of the core CLI application in TypeScript.
*   Integration with Azure OpenAI (primary), with support for Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama as secondary providers.
*   Development of templates and AI prompts for generating all PMBOK-compliant documents.
*   Implementation of a robust context management system, including intelligent source discovery and relevance scoring.
*   Implementation of a comprehensive validation framework ensuring PMBOK 7.0 compliance.
*   Creation of user documentation, including a comprehensive README, CLI help, and tutorials.
*   Deployment and distribution via npm.
*   Implementation of a built-in VCS for generated documents.
*   Development of a technical design document generation system, including ten specialized processors.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Integration with third-party project management tools (this is planned for future phases).
*   Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
*   Support for non-markdown project documentation formats.
*   Real-time collaborative editing of generated documents.
*   Extensive marketing and sales efforts beyond initial release.


**9. Project Deliverables:**

*   Fully functional CLI application.
*   Comprehensive suite of PMBOK documentation templates.
*   AI prompts for intelligent content generation.
*   User documentation and tutorials.
*   Deployed npm package.
*   Test suite with high coverage.


**10. Project Assumptions:**

*   Access to appropriate Azure OpenAI resources and API keys.
*   Availability of necessary development tools and infrastructure.
*   Sufficient expertise in TypeScript, Node.js, and AI integration.
*   Adequate time allocation for development and testing.


**11. Project Constraints:**

*   Project timeline (defined by project end date).
*   Budget limitations (to be defined).
*   Resource availability (to be defined).
*   Dependency on external AI providers (API availability and performance).


**12. Project Risks:**

*   Integration challenges with AI providers.
*   Unexpected API limitations or changes.
*   Difficulty in achieving desired PMBOK compliance level.
*   Lower-than-expected user adoption.


**13. Project Approvals:**

*   Project Sponsor Signature: _________________________  Date: _____________
*   Project Manager Signature: _________________________ Date: _____________


**14. Appendix (Optional):**  Include detailed budget breakdown, resource allocation plan, and risk mitigation strategies.
