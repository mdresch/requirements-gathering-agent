# Project Charter: Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**1. Project Title:** Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA)

**2. Project Manager:**  [Insert Project Manager Name and Contact Information]

**3. Project Sponsor:** [Insert Project Sponsor Name and Contact Information]

**4. Project Start Date:** [Insert Project Start Date]

**5. Project Completion Date:** [Insert Projected Completion Date]

**6. Project Goals and Objectives:**

* Develop a robust and scalable AI-powered tool that automates the generation of PMBOK 7.0 compliant project documentation.
* Achieve a minimum of 500 weekly downloads within six months of launch.
* Maintain a high level of user satisfaction, evidenced by positive reviews and community engagement.
* Continuously improve the accuracy and relevance of generated documents through iterative development and AI model refinement.
* Expand the tool's capabilities to support multiple AI providers and a wider range of project management methodologies.
* Integrate a user-friendly interactive CLI interface for easy provider selection.
* Implement a version control system for generated documents.
* Achieve a consistent 90%+ PMBOK 7.0 compliance score across all generated documents.

**7. Project Scope:**

The project scope encompasses the design, development, testing, deployment, and initial maintenance of the ADPA tool.  This includes:

* **Core Functionality:** Generation of PMBOK 7.0 compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc., as detailed in the project's README).  This also includes the generation of strategic business documents (Company Values, Purpose Statement, etc.).
* **AI Integration:** Seamless integration with Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama, with a robust fallback mechanism.
* **Enhanced Context Management:**  Implementation of a sophisticated 3-phase context management strategy to maximize AI model performance and document accuracy.
* **Comprehensive Project Analysis:**  Ability to analyze all relevant project documentation (beyond the README) to create comprehensive project context.
* **Validation and Quality Assurance:**  Thorough validation against PMBOK 7.0 standards and automated quality assessment scoring.
* **User Interface:** Development of a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) including an interactive provider selection menu.
* **Version Control:** Integration of a version control system for tracking changes to generated documents.
* **Documentation:** Creation of comprehensive user documentation and technical documentation.


**Out of Scope:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (initially).
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI).
* Advanced analytics and reporting dashboards.
* Support for non-markdown document formats (initially).

**8. Deliverables:**

* Fully functional ADPA software application (CLI).
* Comprehensive user documentation.
* Technical documentation (including architecture diagrams and API specifications).
* Deployment to npm.
* Initial set of test cases and validation scripts.

**9. Assumptions and Constraints:**

* Access to appropriate Azure OpenAI and alternative AI provider APIs.
* Availability of project management expertise throughout the project lifecycle.
* Sufficient resources (budget, personnel, and infrastructure) are allocated.
* The project timeline may be impacted by unforeseen technical challenges or changes in AI provider APIs.

**10. Risks:**

* **Technical Risks:**  Integration challenges with AI providers, unforeseen limitations of AI models, unexpected API changes. Mitigation: Robust error handling, fallback mechanisms, and proactive monitoring of AI provider APIs.
* **Resource Risks:**  Insufficient resources (budget, personnel) leading to delays. Mitigation: Regular monitoring of resource allocation and proactive communication with stakeholders.
* **Timeline Risks:**  Unforeseen technical challenges or scope creep may impact the project timeline. Mitigation: Agile development methodology, rigorous testing, and proactive risk management.
