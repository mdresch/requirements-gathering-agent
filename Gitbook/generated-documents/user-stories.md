# User Stories for ADPA (Automated Documentation Project Assistant)

This document outlines user stories for the ADPA project, categorized for clarity and focusing on the key functionalities and user roles.  These stories are based on the provided project context, emphasizing the AI-powered aspects and PMBOK compliance.


**I. Core Functionality: PMBOK Document Generation**

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to automatically generate a complete set of PMBOK-compliant project documents from my project's README file, *so that* I can quickly initiate and plan my project with standardized, accurate documentation.

*As a Business Analyst,* I want the system to analyze my requirements documents and generate a comprehensive requirements specification document, *so that* I can ensure all requirements are clearly documented and traceable.

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to generate a project charter with executive-ready quality, *so that* I can obtain formal project authorization efficiently.

*As a Risk Manager,* I want the system to generate a risk register based on project documentation, *so that* I can proactively identify and mitigate potential project risks.

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to generate all necessary management plans (scope, risk, cost, quality, resource, communication, procurement) *so that* I have a complete set of project management plans aligned with PMBOK standards.

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to generate detailed planning artifacts (WBS, WBS Dictionary, Activity List, Schedule, Milestones), *so that* I have a clear and detailed project plan.

*As a Stakeholder Manager,* I want the system to generate a stakeholder register and engagement plan based on identified stakeholders, *so that* I can effectively manage stakeholder communication and expectations.


**II. Enhanced Features: AI-Powered Analysis and Context Management**

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to intelligently analyze all relevant project documentation (beyond the README), *so that* the generated documents are more comprehensive and accurate.

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to score and prioritize documentation sources based on relevance to PMBOK standards, *so that* I can easily identify the most valuable information for document generation.

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to provide detailed quality scores and recommendations for generated documents, *so that* I can ensure the quality of the documentation.

*As a Technical Lead,* I want the system to generate technical analysis documents (technology stack analysis, data model suggestions, etc.), *so that* I have a clear overview of the technical aspects of the project.

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to use a large language model with a large context window (like Gemini Pro), *so that* the generated documents are more accurate and contextually relevant.


**III.  Strategic Communication Features**

*As a Project Lead,* I want the system to generate executive-ready strategic documents (mission, vision, company values, purpose statement), *so that* I can effectively communicate the project's strategic goals to stakeholders.

*As a CEO,* I want the system to generate a concise and compelling purpose statement that reflects the project's goals and aligns with the company's overall strategy, *so that* I can effectively communicate our vision to investors and employees.

*As a Marketing Manager,* I want the system to generate authentic and compelling company values that reflect the projectâ€™s mission and capabilities, *so that* I can use them to attract talent and clients.


**IV.  Version Control and Maintenance**

*As a Project Manager,* I want the system to automatically version control all generated documents, *so that* I can track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary.

*As a Developer,* I want the system to have a modular architecture, allowing for easy addition of new document types and AI providers, *so that* the system can be easily extended and maintained.

*As a User,* I want clear and comprehensive documentation on how to use the tool and troubleshoot any issues, *so that* I can easily use the tool and get support when needed.


**V.  User Interface and Experience**

*As a User,* I want a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) with clear options and instructions, *so that* I can easily generate the documents I need.

*As a User,* I want the system to provide clear feedback during document generation, including progress updates and error messages, *so that* I know what's happening and can address any issues promptly.

*As a User,* I want an interactive menu to select the AI provider, *so that* I can easily choose the provider I want to use without needing to edit configuration files.


These user stories provide a comprehensive overview of the ADPA functionality and user needs.  They will be further refined and prioritized during the sprint planning process.
