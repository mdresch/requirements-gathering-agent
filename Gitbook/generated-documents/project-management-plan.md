# Project Management Plan: ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Project Management Plan for the Automated Documentation Project Assistant (ADPA) project, formerly known as the Requirements Gathering Agent.  ADPA is an AI-powered tool that generates comprehensive PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. This plan adheres to PMBOK 7th edition standards and leverages the project's unique self-initiated context foundation.

**2. Project Goals and Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:**  Develop and release a robust, scalable, and user-friendly AI-powered tool that automates the creation of PMBOK-compliant project documentation.
* **Objectives:**
    * Achieve 500 weekly downloads within six months of release.
    * Maintain a 95% user satisfaction rating based on feedback surveys.
    * Achieve 90% PMBOK 7.0 compliance validation score for generated documents.
    * Expand support to include three additional AI providers within one year.
    * Integrate a user-friendly interactive CLI for provider selection.

**3. Project Scope**

The project scope encompasses the development, testing, and release of ADPA, including:

* **Core Functionality:**  Generation of PMBOK-compliant documents (Project Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Management Plan, Risk Management Plan, etc., as detailed in the README).
* **AI Provider Integration:** Support for Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, and Ollama.
* **Enhanced Context Manager:**  Implementation of the three-phase context strategy for optimal AI performance.
* **Version Control System:** Built-in Git integration for generated documents.
* **User Interface:**  A command-line interface (CLI) with comprehensive options and clear instructions.
* **Documentation:**  Comprehensive user guides, API documentation, and internal architecture documentation.

**Out of Scope:**

* Integration with third-party project management software (future phase).
* Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) (future phase).
* Support for non-markdown input formats (future phase).

**4. Project Schedule**

**(A detailed Gantt chart would be included here, showing tasks, dependencies, and timelines.  This would be generated using project management software.)**

**Key Milestones:**

* **Milestone 1 (Month 1):** Core functionality complete and unit tested.
* **Milestone 2 (Month 2):** Integration with Azure OpenAI and initial testing.
* **Milestone 3 (Month 3):**  Integration with Google AI and GitHub AI.
* **Milestone 4 (Month 4):** Beta release to a select group of users.
* **Milestone 5 (Month 5):**  Integration with Ollama and final testing.
* **Milestone 6 (Month 6):** Official release to the public.
* **Milestone 7 (Month 12):** Three additional AI provider integrations complete.

**5. Project Organization**

The project will be managed by [Menno Drescher] (Project Manager).  Contributions from the open-source community are actively encouraged.

**6. Communication Plan**

Communication will be facilitated primarily through the project's GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions).  Regular updates will be provided via the README and change log.

**7. Risk Management Plan**

**(A detailed risk register would be included here, identifying potential risks, their likelihood, impact, and mitigation strategies.  This is a crucial element, especially given the reliance on external AI services.)**

**Example Risks and Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Risk:** API downtime for AI providers.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.  Utilize multiple providers where appropriate.
* **Risk:** Unexpected changes in AI provider APIs.
    * **Mitigation:**  Maintain up-to-date knowledge of API changes and implement code that adapts to such changes.
* **Risk:**  Inaccurate document generation due to insufficient context.
    * **Mitigation:** Continuously refine the Enhanced Context Manager and improve context analysis algorithms.
* **Risk:** Security vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigation:**  Conduct regular security audits and promptly address any identified vulnerabilities.


**8. Quality Management Plan**

Quality assurance will be ensured through:

* **Unit Testing:**  Thorough testing of individual modules.
* **Integration Testing:** Testing of the interaction between different components.
* **System Testing:** Testing of the complete system.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):**  Testing by a group of beta users.
* **PMBOK 7.0 Compliance Validation:**  Automated validation of generated documents against PMBOK standards.


**9. Resource Allocation**

* **Human Resources:** [Menno Drescher] (Project Manager) and open-source contributors.
* **Software Resources:**  Node.js, TypeScript, Azure OpenAI, Google AI, GitHub AI, Ollama.
* **Hardware Resources:**  Sufficient computing power for AI processing.

**10. Budget**

**(A detailed budget would be included here, outlining all costs associated with the project.)**  This may include cloud service costs, and potentially expenses for beta testing incentives.

**11. Procurement Plan**

The primary procurement need is cloud services from various AI providers.  Contracts will be established as needed with each vendor.

**12. Stakeholder Management Plan**

Key stakeholders include:

* **End-users:** Project managers, business analysts, and other professionals who need automated document generation.
* **AI Providers:** Azure, Google, GitHub, and Ollama.
* **Open-source community:** Contributors and users providing feedback.

A detailed stakeholder register will be maintained, and engagement strategies will focus on active communication and feedback loops.

**13. Change Management Plan**

Any changes to the project scope, schedule, or budget will be formally documented and approved through a change control process. This will be tracked using a change request log.

**14. Project Closure**

The project will be considered complete upon the successful release of ADPA to the public and the achievement of the defined objectives. A post-project review will be conducted to identify lessons learned and best practices.


This Project Management Plan will be regularly reviewed and updated as the project progresses.  The living document will be available on the project's GitHub repository.
