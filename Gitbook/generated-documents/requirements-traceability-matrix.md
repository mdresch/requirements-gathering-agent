# Requirement Traceability Matrix

**Project:** ADPA - Automated Documentation Project Assistant

**Date:** October 26, 2023

This matrix traces requirements from the project's README and other documentation to specific features and implementation details.  Due to the extensive nature of the provided documentation, this matrix focuses on key requirements and their traceability.  A more comprehensive matrix would require a significantly larger document.
