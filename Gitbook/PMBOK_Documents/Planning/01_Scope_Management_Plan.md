# AI-Generated Scope Management Plan

Certainly! Below is a detailed **Scope Management Plan** for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** project, structured per PMBOK standards and aligned with the project charter and related inputs you provided.

---

# Scope Management Plan  
## Project: Requirements Gathering Agent

---

## 1. Introduction

This Scope Management Plan defines how the project scope will be defined, developed, validated, and controlled throughout the lifecycle of the Requirements Gathering Agent project. Its purpose is to ensure that all project work and only the work required to complete the project successfully is included, ensuring alignment with the PMBOK standards, stakeholder expectations, and organizational policies.

---

## 2. Scope Management Approach

The project scope will be managed through a formal process involving requirements gathering, scope definition, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) development, scope validation with stakeholders, and ongoing scope control. The plan will leverage iterative stakeholder engagement and formal documentation to manage scope creep and ensure traceability.

---

## 3. Scope Definition Process

### 3.1 Inputs

- Project Charter (defines high-level scope, objectives, and constraints)
- Stakeholder Register (identifies needs and expectations)
- Requirements Documentation (detailed functional and non-functional requirements)
- Organizational Process Assets (templates, lessons learned)
- Enterprise Environmental Factors (industry standards, regulatory requirements)

### 3.2 Activities

- Conduct detailed requirements elicitation workshops with key stakeholders (e.g., Project Managers, Business Analysts, Compliance Officers).
- Analyze and document detailed project deliverables, features, and boundaries.
- Identify and document in-scope and out-of-scope items explicitly to prevent ambiguity.
- Define acceptance criteria for project deliverables aligned with PMBOK compliance.

### 3.3 Outputs

- Detailed Project Scope Statement including deliverables, acceptance criteria, and exclusions.
- Updated Requirements Traceability Matrix linking requirements to deliverables.

---

## 4. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Development

### 4.1 Purpose

The WBS will decompose the total project scope into manageable work packages that can be planned, executed, monitored, and controlled effectively.

### 4.2 Approach

- Develop the WBS based on the detailed scope statement and deliverables.
- Use a hierarchical decomposition approach, breaking down project deliverables into smaller components.
- Ensure WBS elements are mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive, and measurable.
- Incorporate PMBOKâ€™s deliverable-oriented WBS guidelines, including major components such as:

  - CLI Module Development  
  - Azure AI Integration  
  - Document Generation Outputs (Charter, Stakeholder Register, Scope Plan, Risk Plan, WBS, Compliance Docs)  
  - JSON Formatting & Schema Validation  
  - Authentication & Security Features  
  - User Documentation & Training  
  - Testing (Unit, Integration, Acceptance)  
  - Deployment & Support Resources

- Validate the WBS with key stakeholders and the project team.

### 4.3 Deliverables

- Approved WBS document with unique identifiers for all work packages.
- WBS Dictionary describing scope, assumptions, constraints, and responsible parties for each work package.

---

## 5. Scope Validation

### 5.1 Purpose

Scope validation ensures that completed deliverables meet the defined acceptance criteria and are formally accepted by the appropriate stakeholders.

### 5.2 Process

- Establish formal acceptance criteria for each deliverable based on PMBOK standards and regulatory requirements.
- Conduct regular review sessions and walkthroughs with stakeholders (e.g., Project Managers, Compliance Officers, Product Owner).
- Use prototypes, demos, and sample outputs (e.g., generated PMBOK-compliant documents) to validate deliverables.
- Document formal acceptance or rejection of deliverables.
- Capture feedback and required changes to be managed through scope control.

### 5.3 Tools and Techniques

- Inspection and reviews
- User acceptance testing (UAT)
- Sign-off documentation and change requests

### 5.4 Outputs

- Accepted deliverables
- Formal acceptance records
- Change requests (if scope changes are identified)

---

## 6. Scope Control

### 6.1 Purpose

Scope control manages changes to the project scope baseline to prevent scope creep and ensure alignment with project objectives.

### 6.2 Change Control Process

- All change requests related to scope must be submitted through a formal Change Request process.
- Change requests are reviewed and evaluated by the Change Control Board (CCB) or designated authority (e.g., Project Manager, Product Owner, Compliance Officer).
- Impact analysis conducted on scope, schedule, cost, quality, and risks.
- Approved changes are incorporated into the project scope baseline, WBS, and related documents.
- Communicate scope changes and impacts to all stakeholders.
- Maintain updated Requirements Traceability Matrix and WBS.

### 6.3 Monitoring and Reporting

- Continuous monitoring of project work against the scope baseline.
- Regular status reporting highlighting scope status, variances, and approved changes.
- Use of scope validation feedback to identify necessary corrective actions.

### 6.4 Tools and Techniques

- Variance analysis
- Configuration management
- Scope change logs
- Regular stakeholder meetings
