|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dependency on Azure AI service availability and API stability may introduce latency or limit flexibility.                |
| Security policies restrict storage/handling of sensitive project data, requiring rigorous data governance and compliance.|
| CLI-only interface delivery may limit adoption among users preferring graphical/web-based tools in current phase.         |
| Strict JSON output formatting may require additional adapters or converters for certain external project management tools.|
| Limited budget and resources preclude development of extensive UI or multi-platform support initially.                    |
| Project timeline is constrained by integration with PMBOK compliance audit schedules.                                     |
| Compliance with regional data residency laws may limit Azure region selection and data storage policies.                  |

## Additional Notes

- **Stakeholder Involvement:** Continuous engagement with key stakeholders such as Project Managers, Compliance Officers, and Business Analysts is essential for validating requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Change Management:** Scope changes must be controlled through formal processes to avoid scope creep and misalignment with PMBOK standards.
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive user guides and training resources are crucial for achieving user adoption targets given CLI delivery.
- **Security & Compliance:** Given regulatory concerns, rigorous security controls and audit trails are mandatory and must be implemented from design through deployment.
- **Fallback Strategies:** Azure AI integration must anticipate service interruptions with retry and fallback mechanisms to maintain system reliability.
