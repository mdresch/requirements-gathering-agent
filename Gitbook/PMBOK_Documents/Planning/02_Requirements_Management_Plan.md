# AI-Generated Requirements Management Plan

# Requirements Management Plan

## 1. Introduction
This Requirements Management Plan outlines how project and product requirements for the Requirements Gathering Agent project will be systematically planned, tracked, and controlled throughout the project lifecycle. Its purpose is to ensure that all requirements—initially drafted by AI and refined through stakeholder engagement—are managed effectively to deliver a solution that meets stakeholder needs, aligns with project objectives, and adheres to organizational standards. This plan provides a foundation for consistent requirement handling, enabling successful scope delivery and change control.

## 2. Requirements Activities

### Elicitation
- Leverage the initial set of requirements, including User Stories, Personas, and Acceptance Criteria, generated by AI as baseline inputs.
- Conduct stakeholder interviews, workshops, and review sessions with project sponsors, end-users, developers, and documentation specialists to gather additional insights and clarify existing requirements.
- Use prototypes or mock-ups where applicable to validate understanding and gather feedback.

### Analysis
- Analyze requirements for clarity, completeness, consistency, and feasibility.
- Identify dependencies, constraints, and assumptions associated with each requirement.
- Categorize requirements into functional, non-functional, technical, and business needs.
- Resolve conflicts or ambiguities through stakeholder discussions and documentation.

### Documentation
- Record requirements in a Requirements Specification document, including detailed User Stories, Personas, and Acceptance Criteria.
- Utilize initial AI-generated documents as a starting point, refining them based on stakeholder input.
- Maintain version control and traceability links to facilitate updates and impact analysis.

### Validation
- Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect needs and are achievable.
- Conduct formal validation sessions, obtaining sign-off on finalized requirements.
- Validate that requirements align with project scope, objectives, and standards such as PMBOK.

## 3. Configuration Management for Requirements

### Change Initiation
- All requirement changes are to be submitted via a formal Change Request process, documented in the project’s change control system.
- Change requests can originate from stakeholders, project team members, or as a result of scope adjustments.

### Impact Analysis
- Evaluate each change request for impacts on scope, schedule, cost, quality, and resource allocations.
- Assess dependencies and traceability implications to ensure comprehensive understanding of the change effects.

### Tracking and Reporting
- Maintain a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) that links requirements to design, implementation, testing, and validation activities.
- Use a centralized requirements management tool or document repository to track status, version history, and change history.
- Regularly review and report on requirement status, including pending, approved, rejected, or implemented changes.

### Approval
- Changes to requirements must be reviewed and approved by the designated Change Control Board (CCB) or project sponsor, depending on the scope of change.
- Document approval decisions and update requirement documents accordingly.

## 4. Requirements Prioritization Process
- Employ prioritization techniques such as MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won’t have) or Value-Impact matrices to rank requirements.
- Prioritize requirements based on stakeholder value, technical feasibility, risk, and project constraints.
- Engage stakeholders in prioritization workshops to ensure alignment with business goals.
- Reassess priorities periodically as project progresses and new information emerges.

## 5. Product Metrics for Requirements
- **Requirement Coverage:** Percentage of requirements fulfilled by implemented features.
- **Requirement Stability:** Number of requirement changes over time, indicating scope stability.
- **Traceability Completeness:** Degree to which requirements are linked to design, implementation, and testing artifacts.
- **Defect Density:** Number of defects related to specific requirements or features.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Feedback scores from stakeholders on requirement clarity and fulfillment.
- **Test Pass Rate:** Percentage of requirements successfully validated during testing phases.

## 6. Traceability Structure
- Maintain a Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) that maps each requirement to:
  - Source document/user story/persona.
  - Design specifications.
  - Implementation tasks.
  - Test cases and validation results.
  - Stakeholder approval status.
- The RTM will be used to verify that all requirements are addressed and validated, facilitate impact analysis of changes, and support scope verification.
- The RTM should be updated continuously as requirements evolve and as artifacts are developed.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities
| Role                          | Responsibilities                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Manager               | Oversees requirement management activities, ensures process adherence, and facilitates stakeholder engagement. |
