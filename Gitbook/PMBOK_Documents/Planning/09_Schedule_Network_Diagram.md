# AI-Generated Project Schedule Network Diagram (Description & Mermaid)

Certainly! Below is a **schedule network diagram description** and the corresponding **Mermaid flowchart syntax** for the Requirements Gathering Agent project execution activities you provided.

## Schedule Network Diagram Description

- The project starts with **Activity 1: Kickoff Meeting**, which has no predecessors.
- Sequential planning activities follow: **Develop Project Management Plan (2)** → **Stakeholder Identification (3)** → **Requirements Elicitation (4)**.
- Requirements elicitation leads to **Requirements Analysis (5)** and also **Test Strategy & Test Cases development (21)** (in parallel after Req Elicitation & Analysis & Architecture).
- After requirements analysis, the **Solution Architecture Design (6)** is performed.
- The **Development Environment Setup (7)** follows architecture design.
- Activities 8 through 18 are development of various modules, all starting after environment setup and running in parallel.
- Once all modules (8-18) are complete, **Integration of Modules & AI API (19)** is conducted.
- Parallel to integration, **Unit Testing (22)** depends on modules being ready.
- After integration and unit testing, **Integration Testing (23)** starts.
- Then comes **System & Acceptance Testing (24)**.
- Defect logging and resolution (25) overlaps with testing activities.
- Test reporting (26) follows testing and defect fixing.
- Deployment planning (27) depends on integration and documentation (20).
- Production environment setup (28) follows deployment planning.
- Release execution (29) happens after production environment is ready.
- Release documentation (30) starts after release execution.
- Training materials (31) and user support helpdesk setup (33) depend on release documentation.
- Training sessions (32) depend on training materials.
- User feedback collection and continuous improvement planning (34) depend on training sessions and helpdesk setup.
- Monitoring (35), issue resolution (36), and feature enhancements (37) start post-release execution.

### Critical Path (Longest duration path)

A rough critical path based on dependencies and durations is:

1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → (8-18 all parallel, but longest module duration is 8 days) → 19 → 23 → 24 → 25 → 26 → 27 → 28 → 29 → 30 → 31 → 32 → 34

This path includes all key planning, development, integration, testing, deployment, and training activities.

### How to use

- Copy the Mermaid syntax above into any Mermaid live editor or markdown environment that supports Mermaid.
- The flowchart visualizes activity dependencies.
- Activities on the **critical path** are highlighted in orange.
- Parallel activities (modules development) branch out from environment setup.
- Testing and deployment phases follow integration and documentation.
- Training and support setup occur after release documentation.
