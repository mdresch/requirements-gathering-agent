### Notes:
1. **Resource Types:** The suggested resource types are based on the roles required to complete the activity efficiently. This includes human resources (e.g., developers, testers, writers) and equipment/software (e.g., Azure AI, testing tools).
2. **Relative Quantity/Intensity:** This reflects the estimated effort level for each resource type (e.g., Full-time, Part-time, High/Medium/Low usage).
3. **Key Factors Influencing Resource Needs:** These are the primary considerations that may impact the resource allocation for each activity.
4. **Specific Resource Assignment & Actual Quantity:** These placeholders ("TBD by Project/Resource Manager") will be finalized during detailed resource planning.
