# 4. Summary and Recommendations

- **Total estimated effort:** ~435 person-days (adjusted for availability and efficiency).
- **Estimated human resource cost:** Approximately $300K USD for the project execution phase.
- **Equipment and materials:** Approx. $21,500 USD including Azure resources and hardware.
- **Key risk factors:**  
  - Stakeholder availability may extend elicitation and validation activities.  
  - AI integration and Azure service dependencies may cause delays affecting DevOps and Developers.  
  - Compliance reviews require dedicated time from Compliance Officer.  
- **Mitigation:** Allocate buffer periods for integration, testing, and defect resolution phases.
