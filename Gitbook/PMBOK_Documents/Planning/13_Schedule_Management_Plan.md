# Time Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

## 1. Introduction

This Time Management Plan defines the scheduling methodology, activity sequencing, duration estimation, and schedule control procedures to deliver the Requirements Gathering Agent project on time, meeting all scope and quality requirements. The plan integrates best practices to manage dependencies, resource availability, and risks, ensuring alignment with PMBOK standards and stakeholder expectations.

## 2. Scheduling Methodology

### 2.1 Scheduling Approach

- **Critical Path Method (CPM):**  
  The schedule will be developed using CPM to identify the longest path of dependent activities determining the project duration. This will help focus attention on critical activities whose delay impacts the project finish date.

- **Iterative and Incremental Planning:**  
  Due to AI integration complexities and potential changes in Azure AI services, iterative scheduling with progressive elaboration will be used. Schedules will be revisited regularly to accommodate new learnings and stakeholder feedback.

- **Resource-Leveling and Constraints Management:**  
  Scheduling will incorporate resource calendars and constraints to avoid overallocation and ensure realistic timelines.

- **Use of Scheduling Software:**  
  Microsoft Project or similar tools will be used to develop, monitor, and update the schedule, supporting visualization, dependency management, and reporting.

### 2.2 Schedule Granularity

- Activities will be decomposed to a level that allows accurate estimation and control (typically 1-5 days per activity).  
- Work packages from the WBS will be broken down into schedule activities in the activity list.

## 3. Activity Sequencing

### 3.1 Identification of Dependencies

- Activities will be sequenced using dependencies such as Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Start (SS), Finish-to-Finish (FF), and Start-to-Finish (SF) where applicable.
- Logical dependencies will be identified through team workshops and subject matter expert input.
- External dependencies (e.g., Azure AI service availability, compliance audits) will be integrated as milestone constraints.

### 3.2 Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM)

- Activities and their dependencies will be visualized using PDM to build the schedule network diagram.
- Leads and lags will be applied to represent overlap or delay between activities.

### 3.3 Parallel and Sequential Activities

- Development, testing, and documentation activities will be planned in parallel where possible to optimize schedule.
- Sequential activities with strict logical order (e.g., schema validation before integration testing) will be strictly enforced.

## 4. Duration Estimation

### 4.1 Estimation Techniques

- **Expert Judgment:** Involve project team leads, Azure AI specialists, and PM experts to estimate durations based on experience.
- **Analogous Estimating:** Use data from similar projects or past AI integration modules to guide estimates.
- **Parametric Estimating:** Apply productivity rates (e.g., lines of code/day, test cases/day) where measurable.
- **Three-Point Estimation:** For critical activities, estimate Optimistic (O), Most Likely (M), and Pessimistic (P) durations to calculate Expected Duration (E) using the formula:  
  E = (O + 4M + P) / 6

### 4.2 Considerations in Estimation

- Complexity of AI prompt engineering and integration with Azure AI.
- Time for iterative testing (unit, integration, acceptance) including regulatory compliance verification.
- Time for documentation, training material preparation, and stakeholder reviews.
- Potential delays due to external dependencies or resource constraints.
- Buffer time for handling Azure AI service outages and fallback mechanism development.

## 5. Schedule Development

### 5.1 Schedule Network Diagram

- Develop the network diagram to visualize activity flow.
- Identify the critical path and near-critical paths for focused monitoring.

### 5.2 Schedule Baseline

- Establish baseline schedule after stakeholder review and approval.
- Baseline will include start and finish dates, milestones, dependencies, and resource assignments.

### 5.3 Milestones

- Key milestones will be defined and incorporated, e.g.:  
  - Project Charter Approval  
  - Completion of AI Integration Module  
  - Schema Validation Complete  
  - Testing Phase Start/End  
  - User Documentation Ready  
  - Final Acceptance Testing  
  - Project Go-Live / Deployment

## 6. Schedule Control Procedures

### 6.1 Monitoring and Reporting

- **Regular Status Updates:** Weekly schedule reviews with project team and stakeholders.
- **Schedule Performance Metrics:** Use Schedule Variance (SV), Schedule Performance Index (SPI), and milestone achievement tracking.
- **Earned Value Management (EVM):** Where applicable, to integrate cost and schedule performance.

### 6.2 Change Control

- All changes to scope or schedule will be managed through formal Change Control Board (CCB) processes.
- Impact analysis will be conducted before approval of schedule changes.
- Approved changes will update the schedule baseline and communicated to all stakeholders.

### 6.3 Risk Monitoring

- Monitor schedule risks continuously (e.g., Azure AI outages, compliance delays).
- Adjust schedule buffers and contingency plans based on risk status.

### 6.4 Issue Management

- Track schedule-related issues and escalate promptly.
- Implement corrective actions to minimize impact on critical path.

### 6.5 Tools and Documentation

- Update schedule documents and network diagrams after each review.
- Use scheduling software version control and access management.
