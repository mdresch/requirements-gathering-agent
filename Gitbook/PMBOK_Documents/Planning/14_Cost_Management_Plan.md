# AI-Generated Cost Management Plan

# Cost Management Plan for Requirements Gathering Agent Project

---

## 1. Introduction

This Cost Management Plan defines the procedures, tools, and techniques to estimate, budget, control, and monitor costs for the Requirements Gathering Agent project. It aligns with PMBOK® standards and ensures that project expenditures remain within the approved budget while delivering the planned scope and quality.

## 2. Cost Estimation Methods

### 2.1 Estimation Approach

- **Bottom-Up Estimating:**  
  Detailed cost estimates will be prepared by decomposing work packages into activities and estimating each resource’s cost (labor, tools, cloud services). This granular approach supports accuracy and traceability.

- **Analogous Estimating:**  
  Historical data from similar AI integration and CLI development projects will supplement estimates for schedule and cost baselines where detailed data is unavailable.

- **Parametric Estimating:**  
  Where applicable, parametric models (e.g., cost per API call, developer hourly rates, hours per document type) will be used to validate bottom-up estimates.

- **Three-Point Estimating:**  
  For high-risk or uncertain cost elements (e.g., Azure AI usage variability, training hours), optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic cost scenarios will be calculated to derive expected costs.

### 2.2 Estimation Tools and Techniques

- Expert judgment from project leads, Azure AI specialists, and PMO.
- Cost estimation templates and spreadsheets.
- Vendor quotes for Azure AI services and third-party tools.
- Historical project cost databases and lessons learned.

## 3. Budgeting Procedures

### 3.1 Cost Baseline Development

- Aggregate detailed cost estimates to establish the project cost baseline.
- Include all cost categories: labor, Azure AI/cloud services, security/compliance, training, project management, contingency.
- Document assumptions, constraints, and excluded items clearly.
- Review and approve baseline with key stakeholders and sponsors.

### 3.2 Contingency Reserve

- Allocate approximately 10% contingency reserve to cover identified risks and uncertainties.
- Monitor contingency usage and adjust reserve as project proceeds.

### 3.3 Cost Aggregation and Work Packages

- Costs will be aggregated by WBS elements and project phases to facilitate tracking.
- Each cost account will have an assigned budget owner responsible for monitoring expenditures.

### 3.4 Funding and Cash Flow

- Define funding requirements and schedule aligned with project milestones and resource utilization.
- Coordinate with finance for budget release and expenditure controls.

## 4. Cost Control Processes

### 4.1 Monitoring and Tracking

- Use Earned Value Management (EVM) metrics (see Section 5) to monitor cost performance.
- Track actual expenditures vs. planned costs on a regular basis (weekly or biweekly).
- Maintain a cost ledger for recording all expenditures and commitments.
- Use project management software (e.g., MS Project, Azure DevOps) to capture cost data.

### 4.2 Variance Analysis

- Calculate Cost Variance (CV) and Cost Performance Index (CPI) to evaluate cost efficiency.
- Investigate significant variances beyond thresholds (e.g., ±5%) and identify root causes.

### 4.3 Change Control

- All cost-impacting scope or schedule changes must go through the Change Control Board (CCB).
- Update cost baseline and forecasts after approved changes.
- Communicate changes to stakeholders promptly.

### 4.4 Forecasting

- Periodically forecast Estimate at Completion (EAC) and Estimate to Complete (ETC) based on current performance.
- Update forecasts with changing assumptions or risk realizations.

### 4.5 Reporting

- Prepare and distribute regular cost status reports to stakeholders.
- Highlight variances, risks, and corrective actions.

## 5. Earned Value Management (EVM)

### 5.1 EVM Metrics to Use

- **Planned Value (PV):** Budgeted cost for scheduled work up to the reporting date.
- **Earned Value (EV):** Budgeted cost for work actually completed by the reporting date.
- **Actual Cost (AC):** Actual cost incurred for work performed.

### 5.2 Performance Indicators

- **Cost Variance (CV) = EV – AC:** Positive CV indicates under budget.
- **Schedule Variance (SV) = EV – PV:** Positive SV indicates ahead of schedule.
- **Cost Performance Index (CPI) = EV / AC:** CPI > 1 indicates cost efficiency.
- **Schedule Performance Index (SPI) = EV / PV:** SPI > 1 indicates schedule efficiency.

### 5.3 Forecasting Formulas

- **Estimate at Completion (EAC):**  
  - If performance is typical:  
    EAC = BAC / CPI  
  - If future work differs:  
    EAC = AC + Bottom-up ETC  

- **Estimate to Complete (ETC):**  
  ETC = EAC – AC

### 5.4 EVM Use in Project

- Integrate EVM data into weekly project reviews.
- Use EVM to inform decision-making on resource allocation and corrective actions.
- Include EVM indicators in stakeholder reports.
