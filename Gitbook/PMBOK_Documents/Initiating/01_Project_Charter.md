# PMBOK® Project Charter (AI-Generated Draft)

# Project Charter: Requirements Gathering Agent

---

## 1. Project Purpose

The **Requirements Gathering Agent** project aims to develop an advanced Node.js/TypeScript module that automates the generation of comprehensive, PMBOK-compliant project management documentation. Utilizing Azure AI’s inference capabilities, the solution will produce detailed, structured project artifacts—ranging from strategic planning documents to extensive planning process outputs—thereby streamlining and standardizing project documentation within software development initiatives. This automation enhances accuracy, consistency, compliance, and efficiency, supporting informed decision-making and governance across project lifecycles.

## 2. Project Objectives

- **Automate Project Documentation Creation:**  
  Enable rapid generation of PMBOK-compliant artifacts including project charters, stakeholder registers, scope plans, risk management plans, and work breakdown structures with at least 95% accuracy.

- **Enhance Strategic Planning:**  
  Integrate AI-powered synthesis of project vision, mission, values, user roles, needs, and technology stack analysis to support effective project initiation and ongoing alignment.

- **Improve Project Management Consistency:**  
  Standardize documentation outputs for uniformity and traceability aligned with PMBOK knowledge areas and industry best practices.

- **Facilitate Integration and Flexibility:**  
  Deliver strict JSON-formatted outputs and employ a modular architecture to ensure seamless integration with diverse project management tools and workflows.

- **Leverage AI for Intelligent Insights:**  
  Utilize Azure AI to augment human expertise in requirements analysis, enabling deeper insights and comprehensive risk mitigation.

- **Support Compliance and Governance:**  
  Ensure generated documentation meets regulatory standards and supports organizational audit readiness.

- **Drive User Adoption and Satisfaction:**  
  Achieve at least 70% adoption among target project management teams and maintain user satisfaction scores above 85%.

## 3. Project Scope

### In Scope

- Development of a Node.js/TypeScript CLI module for automated document generation.
- Integration with Azure AI inference services for natural language processing and insight generation.
- Generation of PMBOK-compliant documents including but not limited to:  
  - Project Charters  
  - Stakeholder Registers  
  - Scope Management Plans  
  - Risk Management Plans  
  - Work Breakdown Structures  
  - Compliance and Regulatory Documentation  
- Strict JSON output formatting for interoperability.
- Modular design supporting extensibility and integration with third-party tools.
- Authentication and secrets management using Azure Identity SDK.
- User documentation, training materials, and support resources.
- Testing (unit, integration, and acceptance testing) aligned with PMBOK and regulatory requirements.
- Implementation of security and privacy best practices for data handling.

### Out of Scope

- Development of a graphical user interface or web-based front-end (may be considered in future phases).
- Direct integration with specific project management tools beyond providing JSON output (adapters/connectors may be future scope).
- Hosting or deployment infrastructure beyond CLI usage (though recommendations for cloud deployment will be provided).
- Customization of Azure AI models beyond prompt engineering and configuration.
- Management of enterprise-wide project portfolios or PMO governance outside tool usage.

## 6. Assumptions

- Azure AI services will remain available and stable with consistent API interfaces.
- Target users have baseline familiarity with CLI tools or will be trained accordingly.
- Organizational policies permit transmission of project data to Azure cloud services under compliance guidelines.
- Stakeholders will actively engage in requirements validation and feedback cycles.
- The development environment supports Node.js and TypeScript technologies.
- Project management standards remain aligned with PMBOK guidelines throughout development.

## 7. Constraints

- Dependency on Azure AI may limit flexibility or introduce latency based on service availability.
- Security policies restrict storage and handling of sensitive project data, requiring rigorous data governance.
- CLI-based delivery may limit adoption among users preferring graphical or web interfaces.
- Strict JSON output formatting may require adapters for certain external tools.
- Limited budget and resource allocation for extensive UI development or multi-platform support initially.
- Project timeline constrained by integration with PMBOK compliance audit schedules.
- Compliance with regional data residency laws may limit Azure region choices.
