| **Incomplete or Misaligned Requirements** | Misunderstanding PMBOK requirements or missing user needs leads to ineffective documentation           | Low        | High        | Medium     | Close stakeholder engagement and validation needed                                  |
| **Project Management Risks**    | Delays in delivering modules, inadequate documentation, or poor user training                             | Medium     | Medium      | Medium     | Impacts adoption and project success                                                 |
| **Data Privacy during AI Calls**| Sending sensitive project data to Azure AI may violate privacy policies or cause data exposure            | Medium     | High        | High       | Requires data governance and anonymization where needed                              |
