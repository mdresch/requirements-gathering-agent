# AI-Generated Data Model Suggestions

Based on the project context, user stories, and personas, here's a conceptual data model outlining key entities, their attributes, data types, and relationships:

---

### 1. Key Data Entities

#### a. User
- Represents all system users, including Project Managers, Developers, Analysts, and DevOps Engineers.

#### b. Project
- Represents individual projects being managed and documented.

#### c. DocumentTemplate
- Templates used for generating different types of project documents.

#### d. GeneratedDocument
- The actual documents generated from templates, possibly customized per project.

#### e. Artifact
- Specific project artifacts such as risk assessments, technical reports, stakeholder analyses, etc.

#### f. Stakeholder
- Individuals or groups involved or impacted by the project.

#### g. Integration
- Records details about CI/CD or external system integrations.

### 3. Primary Relationships

| Relationship Type | Entities Involved                  | Description                                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **One-to-Many**     | User → Projects                   | A user (e.g., Project Manager) manages multiple projects.        |
| **One-to-Many**     | Project → DocumentTemplates       | Templates can be reused across multiple documents.               |
| **One-to-Many**     | Project → GeneratedDocuments      | Each project can have many generated documents.                  |
| **One-to-Many**     | Project → Artifacts               | Projects contain multiple artifacts (risk reports, analyses).   |
| **One-to-Many**     | Project → Stakeholders            | Multiple stakeholders associated with a project.                 |
| **One-to-Many**     | Project → Integrations             | Multiple integrations per project (CI/CD, API, Azure AI).      |
| **Many-to-Many**    | Stakeholders ↔ Communication Plans | Stakeholders can have multiple communication plans (if modeled). |

---

### Summary
- The core entities revolve around **Projects**, **Users**, and **Documents**.
- Templates facilitate standardized document generation.
- Artifacts and Stakeholders capture detailed project-specific data.
- Relationships reflect typical project management hierarchies and workflows.

This conceptual model provides a flexible yet structured foundation to support the system's features, user roles, and document workflows.

**Note:** For implementation, consider normalizing relationships, adding junction tables for many-to-many relations, and defining constraints to ensure data integrity.
