  When the system processes it,  
  Then the output includes:  
  - requirements elicitation methodologies  
  - analysis techniques  
  - traceability matrix format  
  - change control procedures.

- Given the generated plan,  
  When I review it,  
  Then it aligns with PMBOK planning process group standards.

4. **Software Architect – Technology Stack Analysis and Recommendations**

- Given project domain information and constraints (e.g., budget, compliance),  
  When I request technology stack analysis,  
  Then the system outputs an assessment including:  
  - existing technologies  
  - recommended frameworks and libraries  
  - architecture patterns.

- Given the recommendations,  
  When I review them,  
  Then they consider scalability, maintainability, and compliance requirements.

- Given the JSON output,  
  When parsed,  
  Then it is structured with clearly defined sections: analysis, pros/cons, and recommendations.

5. **PMO Administrator – Manage Azure AI API Credentials and Usage**

- Given the admin accesses the module,  
  When inputting or updating Azure AI API keys via CLI or config files,  
  Then the module accepts the keys securely.

- Given API keys are entered,  
  When saved,  
  Then the system validates the credentials and provides immediate error feedback if invalid.

- Given valid credentials,  
  When monitoring usage,  
  Then usage metrics (calls made, cost estimates) are accessible via the admin interface.

- Given stored credentials,  
  When at rest,  
  Then they are stored using best security practices (e.g., encryption, restricted access).

6. **Developer – Output All Documents in Strict JSON Format**

- Given any generated document,  
  When outputted,  
  Then it validates against its predefined JSON schema without errors.

- Given the JSON output,  
  When inspected,  
  Then it includes metadata fields such as generation timestamp, version, and project ID.

- Given CLI or API usage,  
  When specifying an option/flag for JSON output only,  
  Then the system outputs documents exclusively in JSON format.

7. **Project Manager – Generate Risk Management Plan**

- Given a generation request,  
  When producing the Risk Management Plan,  
  Then the output includes:  
  - risk categories  
  - identified risks with descriptions  
  - probability and impact ratings  
  - response plans  
  - assigned owners.

- Given the Risk Management Plan,  
  When reviewed,  
  Then it aligns with PMBOK risk management processes.

- Given the JSON output,  
  When parsed,  
  Then it contains a traceable structure linking each risk element clearly.

---

8. **Product Owner – Generate Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and WBS Dictionary**

- Given project scope data,  
  When generating the WBS,  
  Then the output displays a hierarchical decomposition with unique IDs for each element.

- Given the WBS Dictionary generation,  
  When produced,  
  Then it contains detailed descriptions, responsible parties, and acceptance criteria for each work package.

- Given the JSON output,  
  When imported into scheduling tools,  
  Then it is compatible and correctly formatted.

---

9. **Systems Integrator – CLI Interface for Document Generation**

- Given the CLI is installed,  
  When issuing commands like `generate-project-charter`, `generate-stakeholder-register`, or `generate-full-docs`,  
  Then the system generates respective JSON documents.

- Given commands accept parameters (e.g., input files, output directories),  
  When executed,  
  Then output files are saved to specified locations.

- Given command execution,  
  When errors occur (e.g., invalid inputs),  
  Then CLI provides meaningful feedback and error messages.

  When requesting generation of individual or grouped documents,  
  Then the system generates only those specified without running full documentation generation.

- Given partial document generation,  
  When executed,  
  Then no dependency or data integrity errors occur.

- Given module documentation,  
  When accessed,
