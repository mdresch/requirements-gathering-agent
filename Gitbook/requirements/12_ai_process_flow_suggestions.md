# AI-Generated Process Flow Suggestions

Certainly! Below are detailed business process flows for the **Requirements Gathering Agent** development, deployment, and usage, aligned with your detailed project description, objectives, and user stories. The processes cover key stages from initial requirements elicitation to ongoing maintenance and user support.

# 1. **Project Documentation Generation Process**

### Purpose:
Automate generation of PMBOK-compliant project management documents (charters, registers, plans, etc.) using AI-powered inference.

### Actors:
- Project Manager (PM)
- Business Analyst (BA)
- Software Architect
- Developer
- Quality Assurance (QA)
- Systems Integrator
- CLI/User Interface

### Flow Steps:

1. **Input Collection**
   - PM/BA provides basic project inputs (e.g., project name, objectives, stakeholders, constraints).
   - Inputs can be manual entry or imported from existing systems.

2. **Document Request Initiation**
   - User invokes CLI/API command to generate a specific document (e.g., Project Charter) or a full document set.

3. **Pre-processing & Validation**
   - System validates input completeness.
   - Checks for required fields per PMBOK schema.
   - If incomplete, prompts user to provide missing info.

4. **AI Inference Call**
   - Module sends input data to Azure AI API.
   - Azure AI performs inference to generate content aligned with PMBOK standards.

5. **Document Assembly**
   - AI response parsed and structured into JSON format per predefined schemas.
   - Metadata (timestamp, version, project ID) appended.

6. **Schema Validation**
   - JSON output validated against strict schema for structure and completeness.
   - If errors, system logs and returns error feedback.

7. **Output Delivery**
   - Valid JSON document saved to user-specified directory or returned via API.
   - Human-readable formatted version optionally generated.

8. **User Review & Feedback**
   - User reviews generated document.
   - Provides feedback or requests regeneration if necessary.

9. **Integration**
   - Documents can be integrated with PM tools or CI/CD pipelines.

# 2. **Azure AI API Credentials and Usage Management Process**

### Purpose:
Securely manage Azure AI API credentials and monitor usage to ensure secure and cost-effective AI integration.

### Actors:
- PMO Administrator
- DevOps Engineer

### Flow Steps:

1. **Credential Input**
   - PMO Administrator uses CLI or config file to input/update Azure API keys.

2. **Validation**
   - System validates credentials by performing a test API call.
   - On success, credentials saved securely (encrypted storage or secrets vault).
   - On failure, error feedback provided with remediation instructions.

3. **Access Control**
   - Credentials access restricted by role-based permissions.
   - Rotation policy enforced per organizational security standards.

4. **Usage Monitoring**
   - System collects API call counts, costs, and performance metrics.
   - Usage reports accessible via admin dashboard or CLI command.

5. **Alerts & Reporting**
   - Threshold-based alerts for excessive usage or errors.
   - Regular usage summaries emailed to PMO administrators.

# 3. **Modular Document Generation and CLI Workflow**

### Purpose:
Enable flexible generation of individual or grouped PM documents via CLI for integration and automation.

### Actors:
- Developer
- Systems Integrator
- Project Manager

### Flow Steps:

1. **Command Invocation**
   - User runs CLI command with parameters (e.g., `generate-project-charter --projectId XYZ --output ./docs`).

2. **Parameter Validation**
   - CLI validates parameters and checks for required inputs.

3. **Document Generation**
   - Calls internal module functions for requested document(s).
   - Each document generated independently or as part of a batch.

4. **Error Handling**
   - CLI displays clear error messages for missing inputs or generation failures.
   - Logs retained for diagnostics.

5. **Output Management**
   - JSON outputs written to specified locations.
   - Optionally triggers downstream actions (e.g., upload to PM tool).

6. **Feedback**
   - CLI prints summary of generated files and statuses.

# 4. **Technology Stack Analysis and Recommendation Process**

### Purpose:
Provide technical architecture recommendations based on project domain and constraints.

### Actors:
- Software Architect
- PMO Lead

### Flow Steps:

1. **Input Domain and Constraints**
   - Architect inputs project domain, current tech stack, constraints (budget, compliance).

2. **Analysis Execution**
   - System invokes AI inference with inputs to analyze existing technologies and identify gaps.

3. **Recommendation Generation**
   - AI returns assessment including pros/cons and suggested frameworks, libraries, architecture patterns.

4. **Structured Output**
   - Recommendations formatted as JSON with sections: analysis, pros/cons, recommendations.

5. **Review and Approval**
   - Architect reviews output and integrates into overall project documentation.

---

# 5. **Quality Assurance and Compliance Validation Process**

### Purpose:
Ensure generated documents meet PMBOK, quality, and compliance standards.

### Actors:
- QA Lead
- Compliance Officer

### Flow Steps:

1. **Test Case Definition**
   - QA defines test cases based on acceptance criteria for each document type.

2. **Automated Validation**
   - Run JSON schema validation on generated documents.
   - Verify inclusion of mandatory sections and traceability links.

3. **Functional Testing**
   - Perform manual and automated tests to check content accuracy and completeness.

4. **Compliance Review**
   - Compliance Officer reviews compliance-related documents for regulatory adherence.

5. **Feedback Loop**
   - Issues logged and communicated to development.
   - Retesting after fixes.

---

# 6. **User Support and Training Process**

### Purpose:
Provide guidance, training, and support for users of the Requirements Gathering Agent.

### Actors:
- Support Staff
- End Users (PM, BA, Developers)

### Flow Steps:

1. **Documentation Creation**
   - Develop user guides, FAQs, CLI usage manuals, and API references.

2. **Training Sessions**
   - Conduct onboarding webinars and workshops.

3. **Helpdesk Support**
   - Provide channels for issue reporting and assistance.

4. **User Feedback Collection**
   - Regular surveys to gather user satisfaction and improvement suggestions.

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Update documentation and training materials based on feedback.
