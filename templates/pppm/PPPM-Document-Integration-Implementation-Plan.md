# PPPM Document Integration Implementation Plan

## Objective
Integrate essential Portfolio, Program, and Project Management (PPPM) documents as system templates to support the full PPPM lifecycle.

---

## 1. Scope
- Standardize and automate the generation of key PPPM documents.
- Ensure templates are accessible and customizable within the system.
- Map each template to the appropriate lifecycle stage and management level (Project, Program, Portfolio).

## 2. Document List & Lifecycle Mapping

| Lifecycle Stage         | Project Level         | Program Level         | Portfolio Level         |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Initiation             | Project Charter      | Program Charter      |                        |
| Planning               | WBS, Stakeholder Analysis, Risk Register | Stakeholder Analysis, Risk Register |                        |
| Execution              | Status Report, Change Request | Status Report, Change Request |                        |
| Monitoring & Controlling| Status Report, Risk Register | Status Report, Risk Register | Portfolio Dashboard    |
| Closure                | Lessons Learned      | Lessons Learned      |                        |

## 3. Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Template Design & Standardization
- Review and finalize the content/structure of each document template.
- Ensure templates use consistent formatting, naming, and metadata fields.
- Store templates in a central `templates/pppm/` directory.

### Step 2: System Integration
- Develop or update the template management module to:
  - Load and render markdown/JSON templates.
  - Allow dynamic field population (e.g., project name, dates, stakeholders).
  - Support versioning and customization by users.
- Map each template to its lifecycle stage and management level in the UI.

### Step 3: Automation & Workflow
- Enable automated generation of documents at key lifecycle milestones (e.g., project initiation, closure).
- Integrate approval and review workflows for documents requiring sign-off.
- Provide export options (PDF, DOCX, Markdown).

### Step 4: Training & Documentation
- Create user guides and training materials for using and customizing templates.
- Conduct training sessions for project/program/portfolio managers.

### Step 5: Review & Continuous Improvement
- Collect user feedback on template usability and coverage.
- Schedule periodic reviews to update templates and workflows as needed.

---

## 4. Success Criteria
- All essential PPPM documents are available as system templates.
- Users can generate, customize, and manage documents for all lifecycle stages.
- Templates are kept up-to-date and aligned with best practices.

## Appendix: Standard PPPM Document Templates

### 1. Project Charter
Defines project purpose, objectives, scope, stakeholders, and authorization. Includes business case, objectives, success criteria, scope, stakeholder matrix, timeline, budget, risk summary, and authorization signatures.

### 2. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
Hierarchical decomposition of project deliverables and work packages. Includes project management, requirements & design, implementation, deployment & training.

### 3. Project Status Report
Tracks project progress, accomplishments, milestones, budget, schedule, issues, risks, action items, and next period focus.

### 4. Risk Register
Identifies, assesses, and manages project/program risks. Includes risk description, category, probability, impact, score, owner, mitigation, contingency, and status.

### 5. Change Request Form
Documents and manages changes to scope, schedule, budget, or resources. Includes change description, business justification, impact analysis, alternatives, stakeholder impact, and approval section.

### 6. Program Charter
Defines program vision, objectives, components, benefits, governance, and success criteria. Aligns multiple projects under strategic objectives.

### 7. Stakeholder Analysis & Communication Plan
