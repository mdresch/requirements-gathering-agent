- Three sizes: small, medium, large
- SVG-based circular gauge with needle pointing to actual score
- Performance metrics display (projected, actual, difference, percentage)
- Status badges and trend indicators

**Usage**:
```tsx
<PerformanceGauge
  projectedScore={85}
  actualScore={92}
  title="BABOK Compliance"
  subtitle="Business Analysis Standards"
  size="medium"
