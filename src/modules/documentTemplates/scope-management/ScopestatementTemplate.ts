## AI SYNTHESIS INSTRUCTIONS

**You are tasked with creating a comprehensive Project Scope Statement by analyzing and synthesizing the following sources:**

### üìã **Primary Analysis Sources:**
1. **Business Case** - Extract business objectives, success criteria, and strategic rationale
2. **User Stories** - Identify functional requirements, user needs, and system interactions  
3. **User Personas** - Understand stakeholder needs and usage patterns
4. **Project Context** - Leverage README, project description, and technical specifications
5. **Requirements Documentation** - Any existing requirements or feature specifications

### üéØ **Synthesis Process:**
1. **Project Scope Description:** Synthesize a clear narrative of what the project will deliver
2. **Deliverables Analysis:** Extract tangible outputs from User Stories and Business Case
3. **Boundary Definition:** Determine what's in scope vs. out of scope based on context analysis
4. **Acceptance Criteria:** Derive measurable completion criteria from business objectives
5. **Constraints & Assumptions:** Infer technical, business, and resource limitations

### üìê **Template Structure to Complete:**

## Document Purpose

This Project Scope Statement provides a comprehensive definition of project scope, deliverables, boundaries, and acceptance criteria. It serves as the foundational document for scope management and change control throughout the project lifecycle.

**PMBOK Reference:** 5.3.3.1 - Project Scope Statement

---

## 1. Project Scope Description

**Instructions for AI:** Based on the Business Case and User Stories, create a comprehensive narrative describing what this project will accomplish. Focus on business value and outcomes.

### 1.1 Project Purpose and Justification
[AI: Extract from Business Case - Why is this project being undertaken?]

### 1.2 Product Scope Description  
[AI: Synthesize from User Stories and context - What product/service will be created?]

### 1.3 Project Objectives
[AI: Extract measurable objectives from Business Case and context]

---

## 2. Project Deliverables

**Instructions for AI:** Analyze User Stories, Business Case, and project context to identify all tangible deliverables.

### 2.1 Primary Deliverables
[AI: List main deliverables extracted from User Stories and Business Case]

### 2.2 Secondary Deliverables  
[AI: Identify supporting deliverables like documentation, training, etc.]

### 2.3 Deliverable Acceptance Criteria
[AI: For each deliverable, define measurable acceptance criteria]

---

## 3. Scope Boundaries

### 3.1 In Scope
**Instructions for AI:** Based on User Stories and Business Case analysis, clearly define what IS included in this project.

[AI: Create comprehensive list of included features, functions, and deliverables]

### 3.2 Out of Scope  
**Instructions for AI:** Based on context analysis and common scope creep patterns, define what is explicitly NOT included.

[AI: List features/functions that are explicitly excluded to prevent scope creep]

---

## 4. Project Requirements

### 4.1 Functional Requirements
[AI: Extract from User Stories - What must the system do?]

### 4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
[AI: Infer from context - Performance, security, usability requirements]

### 4.3 Quality Requirements
[AI: Extract quality standards from Business Case and context]

---

## 5. Project Constraints

**Instructions for AI:** Analyze project context to identify likely constraints. Include intelligent placeholders for organizational constraints.

### 5.1 Technical Constraints
[AI: Infer from project context and technology stack]

### 5.2 Resource Constraints  
[PLACEHOLDER - Organizational Input Required]
- Budget: [TBD - Finance Department Input]
- Timeline: [TBD - Project Schedule Input]  
- Personnel: [TBD - HR/Resource Management Input]

### 5.3 Environmental Constraints
[AI: Infer from context - platform, integration, compliance requirements]

---

## 6. Project Assumptions

**Instructions for AI:** Based on project context and Business Case, identify key assumptions that underpin the project scope.

### 6.1 Technical Assumptions
[AI: Infer technical assumptions from project context]

### 6.2 Business Assumptions
[AI: Extract business assumptions from Business Case]

### 6.3 Resource Assumptions
[PLACEHOLDER - Organizational Input Required]
- Stakeholder availability: [TBD - Organizational Input]
- Resource allocation: [TBD - Resource Management Input]
- Decision-making authority: [TBD - Governance Input]

---

## 7. Success Criteria and Acceptance Criteria

### 7.1 Project Success Criteria
[AI: Extract from Business Case - How will project success be measured?]

### 7.2 Product Acceptance Criteria
[AI: Synthesize from User Stories - How will deliverables be accepted?]

---

## 8. Organizational Completion Instructions

**To Complete This Scope Statement:**

1. **Review AI-Generated Content:** Validate the scope boundaries, deliverables, and requirements extracted by AI
2. **Add Organizational Constraints:** Complete the resource, budget, and timeline constraint sections
3. **Validate Assumptions:** Confirm or modify the technical and business assumptions
4. **Stakeholder Review:** Have key stakeholders review and approve the scope boundaries
5. **Integration Check:** Ensure alignment with Business Case and User Stories

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. **Scope Validation Workshop:** Conduct stakeholder review of scope boundaries
2. **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Use this scope statement to create detailed WBS
3. **Change Control Process:** Establish scope change management procedures
